<head>NPNF2-05. Gregory of Nyssa: Dogmatic Treatises,
Etc.</head>
<p>Author(s): Gregory of Nyssa
Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.This volume contains
selected treatises of St. Gregory of Nyssa. A fourth century
bishop, St. Gregory wrote on theology, philosophy, ethics,
oration, and asceticism.The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers
are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations
of instructive and illuminating texts from some of the great
theologians of the Christian church.These spiritually enlightening
texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years,
and remain instructive and fruitful even today!

<p>Book I 60</p>
<p>Preface.--It is useless to attempt to benefit those who will not accept help. 60</p>
<p>We have been justly provoked to make this Answer, being stung by Eunomius' 
accusations of our brother.62</p>
<p>We see nothing remarkable in logical force in the treatise of Eunomius, and 
so embark on our Answer with a just confidence.63</p>
<p>Eunomius displays much folly and fine writing, but very little seriousness 
about vital points.65</p>
<p>His peculiar caricature of the bishops, Eustathius of Armenia and Basil of 
Galatia, is not well drawn.68</p>

<pb n="iii"/>
<p>A notice of Aetius, Eunomius' master in heresy, and of Eunomius himself, 
describing the origin and avocations of each.70</p>
<p>Eunomius himself proves that the confession of faith which He made was not
impeached.74</p>
<p>Facts show that the terms of abuse which he has employed against Basil are 
more suitable for himself.77</p>
<p>In charging Basil with not defending his faith at the time of the 'Trials,' he 
lays himself open to the same charge.79</p>
<p>All his insulting epithets are shewn by facts to be false. 82</p>
<p>The sophistry which he employs to prove our acknowledgment that he had 
been tried, and that the confession of his faith had not been unimpeached, is
feeble.86</p>
<p>His charge of cowardice is baseless: for Basil displayed the highest courage 
before the Emperor and his Lord-Lieutenants.88</p>
<p>Résumé of his dogmatic teaching. Objections to it in detail. 93</p>
<p>He did wrong, when mentioning the Doctrines of Salvation, in adopting terms 
of his own choosing instead of the traditional terms Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit.96</p>
<p>He does wrong in making the being of the Father alone proper and supreme, 
implying by his omission of the Son and the Spirit that theirs is improperly
spoken of, and is inferior.98</p>
<p>Examination of the meaning of 'subjection:' in that he says that the nature of 
the Holy Spirit is subject to that of the Father and the Son. It is shewn that
the Holy Spirit is of an equal, not inferior, rank to the Father and the Son.101</p>
<p>Discussion as to the exact nature of the 'energies' which, this man declares, 
'follow' the being of the Father and of the Son.104</p>
<p>He has no reason for distinguishing a plurality of beings in the Trinity. He 
offers no demonstration that it is so.105</p>
<p>His acknowledgment that the Divine Being is 'single' is only verbal. 107</p>
<p>He does wrong in assuming, to account for the existence of the Only-Begotten, 
an 'energy' that produced Christ's Person.110</p>
<p>The blasphemy of these heretics is worse than the Jewish unbelief. 113</p>
<p>He has no right to assert a greater and less in the Divine being. A systematic 
statement of the teaching of the Church.114</p>
<p>These doctrines of our Faith witnessed to and confirmed by Scripture passages. 120</p>

<pb n="iv"/>
<p>His elaborate account of degrees and differences in 'works' and 'energies' 
within the Trinity is absurd.123</p>
<p>He who asserts that the Father is 'prior' to the Son with any thought of an 
interval must perforce allow that even the Father is not without beginning.127</p>
<p>It will not do to apply this conception, as drawn out above, of the Father and 
Son to the Creation, as they insist on doing: but we must contemplate the Son
apart with the Father, and believe that the Creation had its origin from a
definite point.130</p>
<p>He falsely imagines that the same energies produce the same works, and that 
variation in the works indicates variation in the energies.135</p>
<p>He falsely imagines that we can have an unalterable series of harmonious 
natures existing side by side.138</p>
<p>He vainly thinks that the doubt about the energies is to be solved by the beings, 
and reversely.142</p>
<p>There is no Word of God that commands such investigations: the uselessness 
of the philosophy which makes them is thereby proved.143</p>
<p>The observations made by watching Providence are sufficient to give us the 
knowledge of sameness of Being.144</p>
<p>His dictum that 'the manner of the likeness must follow the manner of the 
generation' is unintelligible.146</p>
<p>He declares falsely that 'the manner of the generation is to be known from 
the intrinsic worth of the generator'.149</p>
<p>The Passage where he attacks the ῾Ομοούσιον, and the contention in answer 
to it.152</p>
<p>Proof that the Anomoean teaching tends to Manichæism. 156</p>
<p>A passing repetition of the teaching of the Church. 161</p>
<p>Defence of S. Basil's statement, attacked by Eunomius, that the terms 'Father' 
and 'The Ungenerate' can have the same meaning.163</p>
<p>Several ways of controverting his quibbling syllogisms. 166</p>
<p>Answer to the question he is always asking, “Can He who is be begotten?” 177</p>
<p>His unsuccessful attempt to be consistent with his own statements after Basil 
has confuted him.183</p>
<p>The thing that follows is not the same as the thing that it follows. 185</p>
<p>Explanation of 'Ungenerate,' and a 'study' of Eternity. 187</p>
<p>Book II 192</p>

<pb n="v"/>
<p>The second book declares the Incarnation of God the Word, and the faith 
delivered by the Lord to His disciples, and asserts that the heretics who
endeavour to overthrow this faith and devise other additional names are of
their father the devil.192</p>
<p>Gregory then makes an explanation at length touching the eternal Father, the 
Son, and the Holy Spirit.194</p>
<p>Gregory proceeds to discuss the relative force of the unnameable name of the 
Holy Trinity and the mutual relation of the Persons, and moreover the
unknowable character of the essence, and the condescension on His part
towards us, His generation of the Virgin, and His second coming, the
resurrection from the dead and future retribution.197</p>
<p>He next skilfully confutes the partial, empty and blasphemous statement of 
Eunomius on the subject of the absolutely existent.199</p>
<p>He next marvellously overthrows the unintelligible statements of Eunomius 
which assert that the essence of the Father is not separated or divided, and
does not become anything else.203</p>
<p>He then shows the unity of the Son with the Father and Eunomius' lack of 
understanding and knowledge in the Scriptures.205</p>
<p>Gregory further shows that the Only-Begotten being begotten not only of the 
Father, but also impassibly of the Virgin by the Holy Ghost, does not divide
the substance; seeing that neither is the nature of men divided or severed from
the parents by being begotten, as is ingeniously demonstrated from the
instances of Adam and Abraham.209</p>
<p>He further very appositely expounds the meaning of the term “Only-Begotten,“ 
and of the term “First born,“ four times used by the Apostle.215</p>
<p>Gregory again discusses the generation of the Only-Begotten, and other 
different modes of generation, material and immaterial, and nobly
demonstrates that the Son is the brightness of the Divine glory, and not a
creature.218</p>
<p>He explains the phrase “The Lord created Me,” and the argument about the 
origination of the Son, the deceptive character of Eunomius' reasoning, and
the passage which says, “My glory will I not give to another,” examining them
from different points of view.225</p>
<p>After expounding the high estate of the Almighty, the Eternity of the Son, 
and the phrase “being made obedient,” he shows the folly of Eunomius in his
assertion that the Son did not acquire His sonship by obedience.230</p>

<pb n="vi"/>
<p>He thus proceeds to a magnificent discourse of the interpretation of 
“Mediator,” “Like,” “Ungenerate,” and “generate,” and of “The likeness and
seal of the energy of the Almighty and of His Works.”236</p>
<p>He expounds the passage of the Gospel, “The Father judgeth no man,” and 
further speaks of the assumption of man with body and soul wrought by the
Lord, of the transgression of Adam, and of death and the resurrection of the
dead.242</p>
<p>He proceeds to discuss the views held by Eunomius, and by the Church, 
touching the Holy Spirit; and to show that the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost are not three Gods, but one God. He also discusses different senses of
“Subjection,” and therein shows that the subjection of all things to the Son is
the same as the subjection of the Son to the Father.246</p>
<p>Lastly he displays at length the folly of Eunomius, who at times speaks of the 
Holy Spirit as created, and as the fairest work of the Son, and at other times
confesses, by the operations attributed to Him, that He is God, and thus ends
the book.252</p>
<p>Book III 260</p>
<p>This third book shows a third fall of Eunomius, as refuting himself, and 
sometimes saying that the Son is to be called Only-begotten in virtue of natural
generation, and that Holy Scripture proves this from the first; at other times,
that by reason of His being created He should not be called a Son, but a
“product,” or “creature.”260</p>
<p>He then once more excellently, appropriately, and clearly examines and 
expounds the passage, “The Lord Created Me.“265</p>
<p>He then shows, from the instance of Adam and Abel, and other examples, the 
absence of alienation of essence in the case of the “generate” and “ungenerate.”275</p>
<p>He thus shows the oneness of the Eternal Son with the Father the identity of 
essence and the community of nature (wherein is a natural inquiry into the
production of wine), and that the terms “Son” and “product” in the naming
of the Only-Begotten include a like idea of relationship.279</p>
<p>He discusses the incomprehensibility of the Divine essence, and the saying
to the woman of Samaria, “Ye worship ye know not what.“283</p>
<p>Thereafter he expounds the appellation of “Son,” and of “product of 
generation,” and very many varieties of “sons,” of God, of men, of rams, of
perdition, of light, and of day.285</p>
<p>Then he ends the book with an exposition of the Divine and Human names 
of the Only-Begotten, and a discussion of the terms “generate” and
“ungenerate.”288</p>

<pb n="vii"/>
<p>Book IV 292</p>
<p>The fourth book discusses the account of the nature of the “product of 
generation,” and of the passionless generation of the Only-Begotten, and the
text, “In the beginning was the Word,” and the birth of the Virgin.292</p>
<p>He convicts Eunomius of having used of the Only-begotten terms applicable 
to the existence of the earth, and thus shows that his intention is to prove the
Son to be a being mutable and created.298</p>
<p>He then again admirably discusses the term πρωτότοκος as it is four times 
employed by the Apostle.301</p>
<p>He proceeds again to discuss the impassibility of the Lord's generation; and 
the folly of Eunomius, who says that the generated essence involves the
appellation of Son, and again, forgetting this, denies the relation of the Son
to the Father: and herein he speaks of Circe and of the mandrake poison.305</p>
<p>He again shows Eunomius, constrained by truth, in the character of an advocate 
of the orthodox doctrine, confessing as most proper and primary, not only
the essence of the Father, but the essence also of the Only-begotten.310</p>
<p>He then exposes argument about the “Generate,” and the “product of making,” 
and “product of creation,” and shows the impious nature of the language of
Eunomius and Theognostus on the “immediate” and “undivided” character
of the essence, and its “relation to its creator and maker.”312</p>
<p>He then clearly and skilfully criticises the doctrine of the impossibility of 
comparison with the things made after the Son, and exposes the idolatry
contrived by Eunomius, and concealed by the terminology of “Son” and
“Only-begotten,” to deceive his readers.319</p>
<p>He proceeds to show that there is no “variance” in the essence of the Father 
and the Son: wherein he expounds many forms of variation and harmony,
and explains the “form,” the “seal,” and the “express image.”322</p>
<p>Then, distinguishing between essence and generation, he declares the empty 
and frivolous language of Eunomius to be like a rattle. He proceeds to show
that the language used by the great Basil on the subject of the generation of
the Only-begotten has been grievously slandered by Eunomius, and so ends
the book.326</p>
<p>Book V 330</p>
<p>The fifth book promises to speak of the words contained in the saying of the 330
Apostle Peter, but delays their exposition. He discourses first of the creation,
to the effect that, while nothing therein is deserving of worship, yet men, led
astray by their ill-informed and feeble intelligence, and marvelling at its beauty,

<pb n="viii"/>
deified the several parts of the universe. And herein he excellently expounds
the passage of Isaiah, “I am God, the first.”</p>
<p>He then explains the phrase of S. Peter, “Him God made Lord and Christ.” 
And herein he sets forth the opposing statement of Eunomius, which he made
on account of such phrase against S. Basil, and his lurking revilings and insults.333</p>
<p>A remarkable and original reply to these utterances, and a demonstration of 
the power of the Crucified, and of the fact that this subjection was of the
Human Nature, not that which the Only-Begotten has from the Father. Also
an explanation of the figure of the Cross, and of the appellation “Christ,” and
an account of the good gifts bestowed on the Human Nature by the Godhead
which was commingled with it.337</p>
<p>He shows the falsehood of Eunomius' calumnious charge that the great Basil 
had said that “man was emptied to become man,” and demonstrates that the
“emptying” of the Only-begotten took place with a view to the restoration to
life of the Man Who had suffered.342</p>
<p>Thereafter he shows that there are not two Christs or two Lords, but one 
Christ and one Lord, and that the Divine nature, after mingling with the
Human, preserved the properties of each nature without confusion, and
declares that the operations are, by reason of the union, predicated of the two
natures in common, in the sense that the Lord took upon Himself the sufferings
of the servant, and the humanity is glorified with Him in the honour that is
the Lord's, and that by the power of the Divine Nature that is made anew,
conformably with that Divine Nature Itself.345</p>
<p>Book VI 349</p>
<p>The sixth book shows that He Who came for man's salvation was not a mere 
man, as Eunomius, falsely slandering him, affirmed that the great Basil had
said, but the Only-begotten Son of God, putting on human flesh, and becoming
a mediator between God and man, on Whom we believe, as subject to suffering
in the flesh, but impassible in His Godhead; and demonstrates the calumny
of Eunomius.349</p>
<p>Then he again mentions S. Peter's word, “made,” and the passage in the Epistle 
to the Hebrews, which says that Jesus was made by God “an Apostle and High
Priest”: and, after giving a sufficient answer to the charges brought against
him by Eunomius, shows that Eunomius himself supports Basil's arguments,
and says that the Only-begotten Son, when He had put on the flesh, became
Lord.352</p>
<p>He then gives a notable explanation of the saying of the Lord to Philip, “He 
that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;” and herein he excellently discusses
the suffering of the Lord in His love to man, and the impassibility, creative

<pb n="ix"/>
power, and providence of the Father, and the composite nature of men, and
their resolution into the elements of which they were composed.356</p>
<p>Then returning to the words of Peter, “God made Him Lord and Christ,” he 
skilfully explains it by many arguments, and herein shows Eunomius as an
advocate of the orthodox doctrine, and concludes the book by showing that
the Divine and Human names are applied, by reason of the commixture, to
either Nature.360</p>
<p>Book VII 367</p>
<p>The seventh book shows from various statements made to the Corinthians 
and to the Hebrews, and from the words of the Lord, that the word “Lord” is
not expressive of essence, according to Eunomius' exposition, but of dignity.
and after many notable remarks concerning “the Spirit” and the Lord, he
shows that Eunomius, from his own words, is found to argue in favour of
orthodoxy, though without intending it, and to be struck by his own shafts.367</p>
<p>He then declares that the close relation between names and things is 
immutable, and thereafter proceeds accordingly, in the most excellent manner,
with his discourse concerning “generated” and “ungenerate.”374</p>
<p>Thereafter he discusses the divergence of names and of things, speaking, of 376
that which is ungenerate as without a cause, and of that which is non-existent,
as the Scindapsus, Minotaur, Blityri, Cyclops, Scylla, which never were
generated at all, and shows that things which are essentially different, are
mutually destructive, as fire of water, and the rest in their several relations.
But in the case of the Father and the Son, as the essence is common, and the
properties reciprocally interchangeable, no injury results to the Nature.
He says that all things that are in creation have been named by man, if, as is 
the case, they are called differently by every nation, as also the appellation of
“Ungenerate” is conferred by us: but that the proper appellation of the Divine
essence itself which expresses the Divine Nature, either does not exist at all,
or is unknown to us.379</p>
<p>After much discourse concerning the actually existent, and ungenerate and 
good, and upon the consubstantiality of the heavenly powers, showing the
uncharted character of their essence, yet the difference of their ranks, he ends
the book.381</p>
<p>Book VIII 384</p>
<p>The eighth book very notably overthrows the blasphemy of the heretics who 
say that the Only-begotten came from nothing, and that there was a time
when He was not, and shows the Son to be no new being, but from everlasting,
from His having said to Moses, “I am He that is,” and to Manoah, “Why askest

thou My name? It also is wonderful”;--moreover David also says to God,
“Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail;” and furthermore Isaiah says,
“I am God, the first, and hereafter am I:” and the Evangelist, “He was in the
beginning, and was with God, and was God:”--and that He has neither
beginning nor end: --and he proves that those who say that He is new and
comes from nothing are idolaters. And herein he very finely interprets “the
brightness of the glory, and the express image of the Person.”384</p>
<p>He then discusses the “willing” of the Father concerning the generation of 
the Son, and shows that the object of that good will is from eternity, which is
the Son, existing in the Father, and being closely related to the process of
willing, as the ray to the flame, or the act of seeing to the eye.388</p>
<p>Then, thus passing over what relates to the essence of the Son as having been 
already discussed, he treats of the sense involved in “generation,” saying that
there are diverse generations, those effected by matter and art, and of
buildings,--and that by succession of animals,--and those by efflux, as by the
sun and its beam. The lamp and its radiance, scents and ointments and the
quality diffused by them,--and the word produced by the mind; and cleverly
discusses generation from rotten wood; and from the condensation of fire,
and countless other causes.390</p>
<p>He further shows the operations of God to be expressed by human illustrations; 
for what hands and feet and the other parts of the body with which men work
are, that, in the case of God, the will alone is, in place of these. And so also
arises the divergence of generation; wherefore He is called Only-begotten,
because He has no community with other generation such as is observed in
creation, but in that He is called the “brightness of glory,” and the “savour of
ointment,” He shows the close conjunction and co-eternity of His Nature
with the Father.393</p>
<p>Then, after showing that the Person of the Only-begotten and Maker of things 
has no beginning, as have the things that were made by Him, as Eunomius
says, but that the Only-begotten is without beginning and eternal, and has no
community, either of essence or of names, with the creation, but is co-existent
with the Father from everlasting, being, as the all-excellent Wisdom says, “the
beginning and end and midst of the times,” and after making many
observations on the Godhead and eternity of the Only-begotten, and also
concerning souls and angels, and life and death, he concludes the book.396</p>
<p>Book IX 405</p>
<p>The ninth book declares that Eunomius' account of the Nature of God is, up 
to a certain point, well stated. Then in succession he mixes up with his own
argument, on account of its affinity, the expression from Philo's writings,

<pb n="xi"/>
“God is before all other things, which are generated,” adding also the
expression, “He has dominion over His own power.” Detesting the excessive
absurdity, Gregory strikingly confutes it.405</p>
<p>He then ingeniously shows that the generation of the Son is not according to 
the phrase of Eunomius, “The Father begat Him at that time when He chose,
and not before:” but that the Son, being the fulness of all that is good and
excellent, is always contemplated in the Father; using for this demonstration
the support of Eunomius' own arguments.408</p>
<p>He further shows that the pretemporal generation of the Son is not the subject 
of influences drawn from ordinary and carnal generation, but is without
beginning and without end, and not according to the fabrications constructed
by Eunomius, in ignorance of His power, from the statements of Plato
concerning the soul and from the sabbath rest of the Hebrews.411</p>
<p>Then, having shown that Eunomius' calumny against the great Basil, that he 
called the Only-begotten “Ungenerate,” is false, and having again with much
ingenuity discussed the eternity, being, and endlessness of the Only-begotten,
and the creation of light and of darkness, he concludes the book.416</p>
<p>Book X 421</p>
<p>The tenth book discusses the unattainable and incomprehensible character 
of the enquiry into entities. And herein he strikingly sets forth the points
concerning the nature and formation of the ant, and the passage in the Gospel,
“I am the door” and “the way,” and also discusses the attribution and
interpretation of the Divine names, and the episode of the children of
Benjamin.421</p>
<p>He then wonderfully displays the Eternal Life, which is Christ, to those who 
confess Him not, and applies to them the mournful lamentation of Jeremiah
over Jehoiakim, as being closely allied to Montanus and Sabellius.425</p>
<p>He then shows the eternity of the Son's generation, and the inseparable identity 
of His essence with Him that begat Him, and likens the folly of Eunomius to
children playing with sand.428</p>
<p>After this he shows that the Son, who truly is, and is in the bosom of the 
Father, is simple and uncompounded, and that, He Who redeemed us from
bondage is not under dominion of the Father, nor in a state of slavery: and
that otherwise not He alone, but also the Father Who is in the Son and is One
with Him, must be a slave; and that the word “being” is formed from the word
to “be.” And having excellently and notably discussed all these matters, he
concludes the book.431</p>
<p>Book XI 439</p>

<pb n="xii"/>
<p>The eleventh book shows that the title of “Good” is due, not to the Father 
alone, as Eunomius, the imitator of Manichæus and Bardesanes, alleges, but
to the Son also, Who formed man in goodness and loving-kindness, and
reformed him by His Cross and Death.439</p>
<p>He also ingeniously shows from the passage of the Gospel which speaks of 
“Good Master,” from the parable of the Vineyard, from Isaiah and from Paul,
that there is not a dualism in the Godhead of good and evil, as Eunomius' ally
Marcion supposes, and declares that the Son does not refuse the title of “good”
or “Existent,” or acknowledge His alienation from the Father, but that to Him
also belongs authority over all things that come into being.441</p>
<p>He then exposes the ignorance of Eunomius, and the incoherence and absurdity 
of his arguments, in speaking of the Son as “the Angel of the Existent,” and
as being as much below the Divine Nature as the Son is superior to the things
created by Himself. And in this connection there is a noble and forcible
counter-statement and an indignant refutation, showing that He Who gave
the oracles to Moses is Himself the Existent, the Only-begotten Son, Who to
the petition of Moses, “If Thou Thyself goest not with us, carry me not up
hence,” said, “I will do this also that thou hast said”; Who is also called “Angel”
both by Moses and Isaiah: wherein is cited the text, “Unto us a Child is born.”445</p>
<p>After this, fearing to extend his reply to great length, he passes by most of his 
adversary's statements as already refuted. But the remainder, for the sake of
those who deem them of much force, he briefly summarizes, and refutes the
blasphemy of Eunomius, who says of the Lord also that He is what animals
and plants in all creation are, non-existent before their own generation; and
so with the production of frogs; alas for the blasphemy!451</p>
<p>Eunomius again speaks of the Son as Lord and God, and Maker of all creation 
intelligible and sensible, having received from the Father the power and the
commission for creation, being entrusted with the task of creation as if He
were an artizan commissioned by some one hiring Him, and receiving His
power of creation as a thing adventitious, ab extra, as a result of the power
allotted to Him in accordance with such and such combinations and positions
of the stars, as destiny decrees their lot in life to men at their nativity. Thus,
passing by most of what Eunomius had written, he confutes his blasphemy
that the Maker of all things came into being in like manner with the earth and
with angels, and that the subsistence of the Only-begotten differs not at all
from the genesis of all things, and reproaches Him with reverencing neither
the Divine mystery nor the custom of the Church, nor following in his attempt
to discover godliness any teacher of pious doctrine, but Manichæus, Colluthus,
Arius, Aetius, and those like to them, supposing that Christianity in general
is folly, and that the customs of the Church and the venerable sacraments are

<pb n="xiii"/>
a jest, wherein he differs in nothing from the pagans, who borrowed from our
doctrine the idea of a great God supreme over all. So, too, this new idolater
preaches in the same fashion, and in particular that baptism is “into an artificer
and creator,” not fearing the curse of those who cause addition or diminution
to the Holy Scriptures. And he closes his book with showing him to be
Antichrist.453</p>
<p>Book XII 459</p>
<p>This twelfth book gives a notable interpretation of the words of the Lord to 
Mary, “Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father.”459</p>
<p>Then referring to the blasphemy of Eunomius, which had been refuted by the 
great Basil, where he banished the Only-begotten God to the realm of darkness,
and the apology or explanation which Eunomius puts forth for his blasphemy,
he shows that his present blasphemy is rendered by his apology worse than
his previous one; and herein he very ably discourses of the “true” and the
“unapproachable” Light.464</p>
<p>He further proceeds notably to interpret the language of the Gospel, “In the 
beginning was the Word,” and “Life” and “Light,” and “The Word was made
flesh,” which had been misinterpreted by Eunomius; and overthrows his
blasphemy, and shows that the dispensation of the Lord took place by
loving-kindness, not by lack of power, and with the co-operation of the Father.467</p>
<p>He then again charges Eunomius with having learnt his term ἀγεννησία from 471
the hieroglyphic writings, and from the Egyptian mythology and idolatry, and
with bringing in Anubis, Osiris, and Isis to the creed of Christians, and shows
that, considered as admitting His sufferings of necessity and not voluntarily,
the Only-begotten is entitled to no gratitude from men: and that fire has none
for its warmth, nor water for its fluidity, as they do not refer their results to
self-determining power, but to necessity of nature.471</p>
<p>Then, again discussing the true Light and unapproachable Light of the Father 
and of the Son, special attributes, community and essence, and showing the
relation of “generate” and “ungenerate,” as involving no opposition in sense,
but presenting an opposition and contradiction admitting of no middle term,
he ends the book.473</p>

<p>On the Making of Man. 716</p>
<p>Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, to his brother Peter, the servant of God. 716</p>
<p>Wherein is a partial inquiry into the nature of the world, and a more minute 
exposition of the things which preceded the genesis of man.719</p>
<p>Why man appeared last, after the creation. 722</p>
<p>That the nature of man is more precious than all the visible creation. 723</p>
<p>That the construction of man throughout signifies his ruling power. 724</p>
<p>That man is a likeness of the Divine sovereignty. 725</p>
<p>An examination of the kindred of mind to nature: wherein, by way of
digression, is refuted the doctrine of the Anomoeans.726</p>
<p>Why man is destitute of natural weapons and covering. 727</p>
<p>Why man's form is upright; and that hands were given him because of reason; 
wherein also is a speculation on the difference of souls.729</p>
<p>That the form of man was framed to serve as an instrument for the use of 
reason.733</p>
<p>That the mind works by means of the senses. 734</p>
<p>That the nature of mind is invisible. 736</p>
<p>An examination of the question where the ruling principle is to be considered 
to reside; wherein also is a discussion of tears and laughter, and a physiological
speculation as to the inter-relation of matter, nature, and mind.737</p>
<p>A Rationale of sleep, of yawning, and of dreams. 742</p>
<p>That the mind is not in a part of the body; wherein also is a distinction of the 
movements of the body and of the soul.747</p>
<p>That the soul proper, in fact and name, is the rational soul, while the others 
are called so equivocally; wherein also is this statement, that the power of the
mind extends throughout the whole body in fitting contact with every part.748</p>
<p>A contemplation of the Divine utterance which said--“Let us make man after 
our image and likeness”; wherein is examined what is the definition of the

<pb n="xvi"/>
image, and how the passible and mortal is like to the Blessed and Impassible,
and how in the image there are male and female, seeing these are not in the
prototype.750</p>
<p>What we must answer to those who raise the question--“If procreation is after 
sin, how would souls have come into being if the first of mankind had remained
sinless”.755</p>
<p>That our irrational passions have their rise from kindred with irrational nature. 757</p>
<p>To those who say that the enjoyment of the good things we look for will again 
consist in meat and drink, because it is written that by these means man at
first lived in Paradise.760</p>
<p>What was the life in Paradise, and what was the forbidden tree? 762</p>
<p>That the resurrection is looked for as a consequence, not so much from the 
declaration of Scripture as from the very necessity of things.764</p>
<p>To those who say, “If the resurrection is a thing excellent and good, how is it 
that it has not happened already, but is hoped for in some periods of time?”766</p>
<p>That he who confesses the beginning of the world's existence must necessarily 
also agree as to its end.770</p>
<p>An argument against those who say that matter is co-eternal with God. 772</p>
<p>How one even of those who are without may be brought to believe the Scripture 
when teaching of the resurrection.773</p>
<p>That the resurrection is not beyond probability. 778</p>
<p>That it is possible, when the human body is dissolved into the elements of the 
universe, that each should have his own body restored from the common
source.779</p>
<p>To those who say that souls existed before bodies, or that bodies were formed 782
before souls; wherein there is also a refutation of the fables concerning
transmigration of souls.782</p>
<p>An establishment of the doctrine that the cause of the existence of soul and 
body is one and the same.785</p>

of view.789</p>

<head>Editor’s Preface.</head>
<p>These translations from the works of St. Gregory of Nyssa have involved unusual labour,
which the Editor hopes will be accepted as a sufficient apology for the delay of the volume.
The difficulty has been extreme of conveying with correctness in English the meaning of
expressions and arguments which depend on some of the most subtle ideas of Greek
philosophy and theology; and, in addition to the thanks due to the translators, the Editor
must offer a special acknowledgment of the invaluable help he has received from the exact
and philosophical scholarship of the Rev. J. H. Lupton, Surmaster of St. Paul’s School. He
must renew to Mr. Lupton, with increased earnestness, the expression of gratitude he had
already had occasion to offer in issuing the Translation of St. Athanasius. From the careful
and minute revision which the volume has thus undergone, the Editor ventures to entertain
some hope that the writings of this important and interesting Father are in this volume introduced
to the English reader in a manner which will enable him to obtain a fair conception
of their meaning and value.</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>That none of the Treatises of S. Gregory of Nyssa have hitherto been translated into
English, or even (with one exception long ago) into French, may be partly due to the imperfections,
both in number and quality, of the mss., and by consequence of the Editions, of
the great majority of them. The state of the mss., again, may be owing to the suspicion diligently
fostered by the zealous friends of the reputation of this Father, in ages when mss.
could and should have been multiplied and preserved, that there were large importations
into his writings from the hands of the Origenists—a statement which a very short study of
Gregory, whose thought is always taking the direction of Origen, would disprove.</p>
<p>This suspicion, while it resulted in throwing doubts upon the genuineness of the entire
text, has so far deprived the current literature of the Church of a great treasure. For there
are two qualities in this Gregory’s writings not to be found in the same degree in any other
Greek teacher, namely, a far-reaching use of philosophical speculation (quite apart from
allegory) in bringing out the full meaning of Church doctrines, and Bible truths; and excellence
of style. With regard to this last, he himself bitterly deplored the days which he had
wasted over the study of style; but we at all events need not share that regret, if only for this
reason, that his writings thereby show that patristic Greek could rise to the level of the best
of its time. It is not necessarily the thing which it is, too easily, even in other instances, assumed
to be. Granted the prolonged decadence of the language, yet perfects are not aorists,
nor aorists perfects, the middle is a middle, there are classical constructions of the participle,
the particles of transition and prepositions in composition have their full force in Athanasius;
much more in Basil; much more in Gregory. It obscures facts to say that there was good
Greek only in the age of Thucydides. There was good and bad Greek of its kind, in every
epoch, as long as Greek was living. So far for mere syntax. As for adequacy of language, the
far wider range of his subject-matter puts Gregory of Nyssa to a severer test; but he does
not fail under it. What could be more dignified than his letter to Flavian, or more choice
than his description of the spring, or more richly illustrated than his praises of Contemplation,
or more pathetic than his pleading for the poor? It would have been strange indeed if
the Greek language had not possessed a Jerome of its own, to make it speak the new monastic
devotion.</p>
<p>But the labours of J. A. Krabinger, F. Oehler, and G. H. Forbes upon the text, though
all abruptly ended, have helped to repair the neglect of the past. They in this century, as the
scholars of Paris, Ghent, and Basle, though each working with fewer or more imperfect mss.,
in the sixteenth and seventeenth, have been better friends to Gregory than those who wrote
books in the sixth to defend his orthodoxy, but to depreciate his writings. In this century,
too, Cardinal Mai has rescued still more from oblivion in the Vatican—a slight compensation

<pb n="4"/>
for all the materials collected for a Benedictine edition of Gregory, but dispersed in the
French Revolution.</p>
<p>The longest Treatise here translated is that Against Eunomius in 13 Books. The reproduction
of so much ineffectual fencing in logic over a question which no longer can trouble
the Church might be taken exception to. But should men like Gregory and Basil, pleading
for the spirit and for faith and for mystery against the conclusions of a hard logician, be an
indifferent spectacle to us? The interest, too, in the contest deepens when we know that
their opponent not only proclaimed himself, but was accepted, as a martyr to the Anomoean
cause; and that he had large congregations to the very end. The moral force of Arianism
was stronger than ever as its end drew near in the East, because the Homoeans were broken
up and there was no more complicity with the court and politics. It was represented by a
man who had suffered and had made no compromises; and so the life-long work, previous
to his, of Valens the bishop at last bore fruit in conversions; and the Anomoean teaching
came to a head in the easily understood formula that the ᾽Αγεννησία was the essence of the
Father—an idea which in the Dated Creed Valens had repudiated.</p>
<p>What, then, was to be done? Eunomius seemed by his parade of logic to have dug a gulf
for ever between the Ungenerate and the Generate, in other words between the Father and
the Son. The merit and interest of this Treatise of Gregory consists in showing this logician
as making endless mistakes in his logic; and then, that anything short of the “eternal generation”
involved unspeakable absurdities or profanities; and lastly, that Eunomius was
fighting by means of distinctions which were the mere result of mental analysis. Already,
we see, there was floating in the air the Conceptualism and Realism of the Middle Ages, invoked
for this last Arian controversy. When Eunomius retorted that this faculty of analysis
cannot give the name of God, and calls his opponents atheists for not recognizing the more
than human source of the term ᾽Αγέννητος, the last word of Nicene orthodoxy has to be
uttered; and it is, that God is really incomprehensible, and that here we can never know His
name.</p>
<p>This should have led to a statement of the claims of the Sacraments as placing us in
heart and spirit, but not in mind, in communion with this incomprehensible God. But this
would have been useless with such opponents as the Eunomians. Accuracy of doctrine and
clearness of statement was to them salvation; mysteries were worse than nothing. Only in
the intervals of the logical battle, and for the sake of the faithful, does Gregory recur to those
moral and spiritual attributes which a true Christianity has revealed in the Deity, and upon
which the doctrine of the Sacraments is built.</p>
<p>Such controversies are repeated now; i.e. where truths, which it requires a certain state
of the affections to understand, should be urged, but cannot be, on the one side; and truths
which are logical, or literary, or scientific only, are ranged on the other side; as an instance,

<pb n="6"/>
though in another field, the arguments for and against the results of the “higher criticism”
of the Old Testament exhibit this irreconcilable attitude.</p>
<p>Yet in one respect a great gain must have at once resulted to the Catholic cause from
this long work. The counter opposition of Created and Uncreate, with which Gregory met
the opposition of Generate and Ungenerate, and which, unlike the latter, is a dichotomy
founded on an essential difference, must have helped many minds, distracted with the jargon
of Arianism, to see more clearly the preciousness of the Baptismal Formula, as the casket
which contains the Faith. Indeed, the life-work of Gregory was to defend this Formula.</p>
<p>The Treatise On Virginity is probably the work of his youth; but none the less Christian
for that. Here is done what students of Plato had doubtless long been asking for, i.e. that his
“love of the Beautiful” should be spiritualized. Beginning with a bitter accusation of marriage,
Gregory leaves the reader doubtful in the end whether celibacy is necessary or not for the
contemplative life; so absorbed he becomes in the task of showing the blessedness of those
who look to the source of all visible beauty. But the result of this seeing is not, as in Plato,
a mere enlightenment as to the real value of these visible things. There are so many more
beautiful things in God than Plato saw; the Christian revelation has infinitely enriched the
field of contemplation; and the lover of the beautiful now must be a higher character, and
have a more chastened heart, not only be a more favoured child of light, than others. His
enthusiasm shall be as strong as ever; but the model is higher now; and even an Aristotelian
balance of moral extremes is necessary to guide him to the goal of a successful Imitation.</p>
<p>It was right, too, that the Church should possess her Phædo, or Death-bed Dialogue;
and it is Gregory who has supplied this in his On the Soul and the Resurrection. But the copy
becomes an original. The dialogue is between a sister and a brother; the one a saintly Apologist,
the other, for argument’s sake, a gainsayer, who urges all the pleas of Greek materialism.
Not only the immortality of the soul is discussed, but an exact definition of it is sought,
and that in the light of a truer psychology than Plato’s. His “chariot” is given up; sensation,
as the basis of all thought, is freely recognized; and yet the passions are firmly separated
from the actual essence of the soul; further, the “coats of skins” of fallen humanity, as symbolizing
the wrong use of the passions, take the place of the “sea-weed” on the statue of
Glaucus. The grasp of the Christian philosopher of the traits of a perfect humanity, so conspicuous
in his Making of Man, give him an advantage here over the pagan. As for the Resurrection
of the flesh, it was a novel stroke to bring the beliefs of Empedocles, Pythagoras,
Plato, and the later Platonists, into one focus as it were, and to show that the teaching of
those philosophers as to the destinies of the soul recognized the possibility, or even the necessity,
of the reassumption of some body. Grotesque objections to the Christian Resurrection,
such as are urged nowadays, are brought forward and answered in this Treatise.</p>

<pb n="7"/>
<p>The appeal to the Saviour, as to the Inspiration of the Old Testament, has raised again
a discussion as to the Two Natures; and will probably continue to do so. But before the
subject of the “communication of attributes” can be entered upon, we must remember that
Christ’s mere humanity (as has been lately pointed out1) is, to begin with, sinless. He was
perfect man. What the attributes of a perfect, as contrasted with a fallen, humanity are, it is
not given except by inference to know; but no Father has discussed this subject of Adam’s
nature more fully than Gregory, in his treatise On the Making of Man.</p>
<p>The reasons for classing the Great Catechism as an Apologetic are given in the Prolegomena:
here from first to last Gregory shows himself a genuine pupil of Origen. The plan
of Revelation is made to rest on man’s free-will; every objection to it is answered by the fact
of this free-will. This plan is unfolded so as to cover the whole of human history; the beginning,
the middle, and the end are linked, in the exposition, indissolubly together. The Incarnation
is the turning-point of history; and yet, beyond this, its effects are for all Creation.
Who made this theology? Origen doubtless; and his philosophy of Scripture, based on a few
leading texts, became, one point excepted, the property of the Church: she at last possessed
a Théodicée that borrowed nothing from Greek ideas. So far, then, every one who used it
was an Origenist: and yet Gregory alone has suffered from this charge. In using this Théodicée
he has in some points surpassed his master, i.e. in showing in details the skilfulness (σοφία)
which effected the real “touching” of humanity; and how the “touched” soul and the
“touched” body shall follow in the path of the Redeemer’s Resurrection.</p>
<p>To the many points of modern interest in this Gregory should be added his eschatology,
which occupies a large share of his thoughts. On Infants’ Early Deaths is a witness of this.
In fact, when not occupied in defending, on one side or another, the Baptismal Formula,
he is absorbed in eschatology. He dwells continually on the agonizing and refining processes
of Purgatory. But to claim him as one who favours the doctrine of “Eternal Hope” in a universal
sense is hardly possible, when we consider the passage in On the Soul and the Resurrection
where he speaks of a Last Judgment as coming after the Resurrection and Purgatory.</p>
<p>So much has been said in a Preface, in order to show that this Volume is a step at least
towards reinstating a most interesting writer, doubtless one of the most highly educated of
his time, and, let it be observed as well, a canonized saint (for, more fortunate than his works,
he was never branded as a heretic), in his true position.</p>
<p>In a first English translation of Treatises and Letters most of which (notably the books
against Eunomius) have never been illustrated by a single translator’s note, and by but a
handful of scholia, a few passages remain, which from the obscurity of their allusion, local
or historical, are unexplained. In others the finest shades of meaning in one Greek word,
insisted on in some argument, but which the best English equivalent fails to represent, cause
<note type="footnote">1 Christus Comprobator, p. 99, sq.</note>

<pb n="8"/>
the appearance of obscurity. But, throughout, the utmost clearness possible without unduly
straining the literal meaning has been aimed at; and in passages too numerous to name,
most grateful acknowledgment is here made of the invaluable suggestions of the Rev. J. H.
Lupton.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the Index of Subjects will be of use, in lieu of an analysis, where an
analysis has not been provided. The Index of Texts, all of which have been strictly verified,
while it will be found to prove Gregory’s thorough knowledge of Scripture (notwithstanding
his somewhat classical training), does not attempt to distinguish between citation and reminiscence;
care, however, has been taken that the reminiscence should be undoubted.</p>
<p>The Index of Greek words (as also the quotations in foot-notes of striking sentences)
has been provided for those interested in the study of later Greek.</p>

<head>The Life and Writings of Gregory of Nyssa.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">    
<head>Chapter I.—A Sketch of the Life of S. Gregory of Nyssa.</head>
<p>In the roll of the Nicene Fathers there is no more honoured name than that of Gregory
of Nyssa. Besides the praises of his great brother Basil and of his equally great friend Gregory
Nazianzen, the sanctity of his life, his theological learning, and his strenuous advocacy of
the faith embodied in the Nicene clauses, have received the praises of Jerome, Socrates,
Theodoret, and many other Christian writers. Indeed such was the estimation in which he
was held that some did not hesitate to call him ‘the Father of Fathers’ as well as ‘the Star of
Nyssa’3.”</p>
<p>Gregory of Nyssa was equally fortunate in his country, the name he bore, and the family
which produced him. He was a native of Cappadocia, and was born most probably at Cæsarea,
the capital, about a.d. 335 or 336. No province of the Roman Empire had in those early ages
received more eminent Christian bishops than Cappadocia and the adjoining district of
Pontus.</p>
<p>In the previous century the great prelate Firmilian, the disciple and friend of Origen,
who visited him at his See, had held the Bishopric of Cæsarea. In the same age another saint,
Gregory Thaumaturgus, a friend also and disciple of Origen, was bishop of Neo-Cæsarea
in Pontus. During the same century, too, no less than four other Gregories shed more or
less lustre on bishoprics in that country. The family of Gregory of Nyssa was one of considerable
wealth and distinction, and one also conspicuously Christian.</p>
<p>During the Diocletian persecution his grandparents had fled for safety to the mountainous
region of Pontus, where they endured great hardships and privations. It is said that his
maternal grandfather, whose name is unknown, eventually lost both life and property. After
a retirement of some few years the family appear to have returned and settled at Cæsarea
in Cappadocia, or else at Neo-Cæsarea in Pontus, for there is some uncertainty in the account.</p>
<p>Gregory’s father, Basil, who gave his name to his eldest son, was known as a rhetorician.
He died at a comparatively early age, leaving a family of ten children, five of whom were
boys and five girls, under the care of their grandmother Macrina and mother Emmelia. Both
of these illustrious ladies were distinguished for the earnestness and strictness of their
Christian principles, to which the latter added the charm of great personal beauty.</p>
<p>All the sons and daughters appear to have been of high character, but it is only of four
sons and one daughter that we have any special record. The daughter, called Macrina, from
<note type="footnote">3 ῾Ο τῶν Πατέρων Πατήρ; ·ὁ τῶν Νυσσαέων φωστήρ, Council. Nic. II. Act. VI. Edition of Labbe, p.
477.—Nicephor. Callist. H. E. xi. 19.</note>

<pb n="12"/>
her grandmother, was the angel in the house of this illustrious family. She shared with her
grandmother and mother the care and education of all its younger members. Nor was there
one of them who did not owe to her religious influence their settlement in the faith and
consistency of Christian conduct.</p>
<p>This admirable woman had been betrothed in early life, but her intended husband died
of fever. She permitted herself to contract no other alliance, but regarded herself as still
united to her betrothed in the other world. She devoted herself to a religious life, and eventually,
with her mother Emmelia, established a female conventual society on the familyproperty
in Pontus, at a place called Annesi, on the banks of the river Iris.</p>
<p>It was owing to her persuasions that her brother Basil also gave up the worldly life, and
retired to lead the devout life in a wild spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Annesi.
Here for a while he was an hermit, and here he persuaded his friend Gregory Nazianzen to
join him. They studied together the works of Origen, and published a selection of extracts
from his Commentaries, which they called “Philocalia.” By the suggestions of a friend Basil
enlarged his idea, and converted his hermit’s seclusion into a monastery, which eventually
became the centre of many others which sprung up in that district.</p>
<p>His inclination for the monastic life had been greatly influenced by his acquaintance
with the Egyptian monks, who had impressed him with the value of their system as an aid
to a life of religious devotion. He had visited also the hermit saints of Syria and Arabia, and
learnt from them the practice of a severe asceticism, which both injured his health and
shortened his days.</p>
<p>Gregory of Nyssa was the third son, and one of the youngest of the family. He had an
elder brother, Nectarius, who followed the profession of their father, and became rhetorician,
and like him died early. He had also a younger brother, Peter, who became bishop of Sebaste.</p>
<p>Besides the uncertainty as to the year and place of his birth it is not known where he
received his education. From the weakness of his health and delicacy of his constitution, it
was most probably at home. It is interesting, in the case of one so highly educated, to know
who, in consequence of his father’s early death, took charge of his merely intellectual
bringing up: and his own words do not leave us in any doubt that, so far as he had a teacher,
it was Basil, his senior by several years. He constantly speaks of him as the revered ‘Master:’
to take but one instance, he says in his Hexaemeron (ad init.) that all that will be striking in
that work will be due to Basil, what is inferior will be the ‘pupil’s.’ Even in the matter of
style, he says in a letter written in early life to Libanius that though he enjoyed his brother’s
society but a short time yet Basil was the author of his oratory (λόγου): and it is safe to
conclude that he was introduced to all that Athens had to teach, perhaps even to medicine,
by Basil: for Basil had been at Athens. On the other hand we can have no difficulty in crediting
his mother, of whom he always spoke with the tenderest affection, and his admirable
sister Macrina, with the care of his religious teaching. Indeed few could be more fortunate

<pb n="13"/>
than Gregory in the influences of home. If, as there is every reason to believe, the grandmother
Macrina survived Gregory’s early childhood, then, like Timothy, he was blest with the
religious instruction of another Lois and Eunice.</p>
<p>In this chain of female relationship it is difficult to say which link is worthier of note,
grandmother, mother, or daughter. Of the first, Basil, who attributes his early religious impressions
to his grandmother, tells us that as a child she taught him a Creed, which had been
drawn up for the use of the Church of Neo-Cæsarea by Gregory Thaumaturgus. This Creed,
it is said, was revealed to the Saint in a vision. It has been translated by Bishop Bull in his
“Fidei Nicænæ Defensio.” In its language and spirit it anticipates the Creed of Constantinople.</p>
<p>Certain it is that Gregory had not the benefit of a residence at Athens, or of foreign
travel. It might have given him a strength of character and width of experience, in which=
he was certainly deficient. His shy and retiring disposition induced him to remain at home
without choosing a profession, living on his share of the paternal property, and educating
himself by a discipline of his own.</p>
<p>He remained for years unbaptized. And this is a very noticeable circumstance which
meets us in the lives of many eminent Saints and Bishops of the Church. They either delayed
baptism themselves, or it was delayed for them. Indeed there are instances of Bishops baptized
and consecrated the same day.</p>
<p>Gregory’s first inclination or impulse to make a public profession of Christianity is said
to have been due to a remarkable dream or vision.</p>
<p>His mother Emmelia, at her retreat at Annesi, urgently entreated him to be present and
take part in a religious ceremony in honour of the Forty Christian Martyrs. He had gone
unwillingly, and wearied with his journey and the length of the service, which lasted far into
the night, he lay down and fell asleep in the garden. He dreamed that the Martyrs appeared
to him and, reproaching him for his indifference, beat him with rods. On awaking he was
filled with remorse, and hastened to amend his past neglect by earnest entreaties for mercy
and forgiveness. Under the influence of the terror which his dream inspired he consented
to undertake the office of reader in the Church, which of course implied a profession of
Christianity. But some unfitness, and, perhaps, that love of eloquence which clung to him
to the last, soon led him to give up the office, and adopt the profession of a rhetorician or
advocate. For this desertion of a sacred for a secular employment he is taken severely to task
by his brother Basil and his friend Gregory Nazianzen. The latter does not hesitate to charge
him with being influenced, not by conscientious scruples, but by vanity and desire of public
display, a charge not altogether consistent with his character.</p>
<p>Here it is usual to place the marriage of Gregory with Theosebeia, said to have been a
sister of Gregory Nazianzen. Certainly the tradition of Gregory’s marriage received such
credit as to be made in after times a proof of the non-celibacy of the Bishops of his age. But
it rests mainly on two passages, which taken separately are not in the least conclusive. The

<pb n="14"/>
first is the ninety-fifth letter of Gregory Nazianzen, written to console for a certain loss by
death, i.e. of “Theosebeia, the fairest, the most lustrous even amidst such beauty of the
ἀδελφοὶ; Theosebeia, the true priestess, the yokefellow and the equal of a priest.” J. Rupp
has well pointed out that the expression ‘yokefellow’ (σύζυγον), which has been insisted as
meaning ‘wife,’ may, especially in the language of Gregory Nazianzen, be equivalent to
ἀδελφὸς. He sees in this Theosebeia ‘a sister of the Cappadocian brothers.’ The second
passage is contained in the third cap. of Gregory’s treatise On Virginity. Gregory there
complains that he is “cut off by a kind of gulf from this glory of virginity” (παρθενία). The
whole passage should be consulted. Of course its significance depends on the meaning given
to παρθενία. Rupp asserts that more and more towards the end of the century this word
acquired a technical meaning derived from the purely ideal side, i.e. virginity of soul: and
that Gregory is alluding to the same thing that his friend had not long before blamed him
for, the keeping of a school for rhetoric, where his object had been merely worldly reputation,
and the truly ascetic career had been marred (at the time he wrote). Certainly the terrible
indictment of marriage in the third cap. of this treatise comes ill from one whose wife not
only must have been still living, but possessed the virtues sketched in the letter of Gregory
Nazianzen: while the allusions at the end of it to the law-courts and their revelations appear
much more like the professional reminiscence of a rhetorician who must have been familiar
with them, than the personal complaint of one who had cause to depreciate marriage. The
powerful words of Basil, de Virgin. I. 610, a. b., also favour the above view of the meaning
of παρθενία: and Gregory elsewhere distinctly calls celibacy παρθενία τοῦ σώματος, and
regards it as a means only to this higher παρθενια (III. 131). But the two passages above,
when combined, may have led to the tradition of Gregory’s marriage. Nicephorus Callistus,
for example, who first makes mention of it, must have put upon παρθενία the interpretation
of his own time (thirteenth century,) i.e. that of continence. Finally, those who adopt this
tradition have still to account for the fact that no allusion to Theosebeia as his wife, and no
letter to her, is to be found in Gregory’s numerous writings. It is noteworthy that the Benedictine
editors of Gregory Nazianzen (ad Epist. 95) also take the above view.</p>
<p>His final recovery and conversion to the Faith, of which he was always after so strenuous
an asserter, was due to her who, all things considered, was the master spirit of the family.
By the powerful persuasions of his sister Macrina, at length, after much struggle, he altered
entirely his way of life, severed himself from all secular occupations, and retired to his
brother’s monastery in the solitudes of Pontus, a beautiful spot, and where, as we have seen,
his mother and sister had established, in the immediate neighbourhood, a similar association
for women.</p>
<p>Here, then, Gregory was settled for several years, and devoted himself to the study of
the Scripture and the works of his master Origen. Here, too, his love of natural scenery was
deepened so as to find afterwards constant and adequate expression. For in his writings we

<pb n="15"/>
have in large measure that sentiment of delight in the beauty of nature of which, even when
it was felt, the traces are so few and far between in the whole range of Greek literature. A
notable instance is the following from the Letter to Adelphus, written long afterwards:—“The
gifts bestowed upon the spot by Nature, who beautifies the earth with an impromptu grace,
are such as these: below, the river Halys makes the place fair to look upon with his banks,
and glides like a golden ribbon through their deep purple, reddening his current with the
soil he washes down. Above, a mountain densely overgrown with wood stretches, with its
long ridge, covered at all points with the foliage of oaks, more worthy of finding some Homer
to sing its praises than that Ithacan Neritus which the poet calls ‘far-seen with quivering
leaves.’ But the natural growth of wood as it comes down the hill-side meets at the foot the
plantations of human husbandry. For forthwith vines, spread out over the slopes and
swellings and hollows at the mountain’s base, cover with their colour, like a green mantle,
all the lower ground: and the season also was now adding to their beauty with a display of
magnificent grape-clusters.” Another is from the treatise On Infants’ Early Deaths:—“Nay
look only at an ear of corn, at the germinating of some plant, at a ripe bunch of grapes, at
the beauty of early autumn whether in fruit or flower, at the grass springing unbidden, at
the mountain reaching up with its summit to the height of the ether, at the springs of the
lower ground bursting from its flanks in streams like milk, and running in rivers through
the glens, at the sea receiving those streams from every direction and yet remaining within
its limits with waves edged by the stretches of beach, and never stepping beyond those fixed
boundaries: and how can the eye of reason fail to find in them all that our education for
Realities requires?” The treatise On Virginity was the fruit of this life in Basil’s monastery.</p>
<p>Henceforward the fortunes of Gregory are more closely linked with those of his great
brother Basil.</p>
<p>About a.d. 365 Basil was summoned from his retirement to act as coadjutor to Eusebius,
the Metropolitan of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and aid him in repelling the assaults of the
Arian faction on the Faith. In these assaults the Arians were greatly encouraged and assisted
by the proclivities of the Emperor Valens. After some few years of strenuous and successful
resistance, and the endurance of great persecution from the Emperor and his Court, a persecution
which indeed pursued him through life, Basil is called by the popular voice, on the
death of Eusebius, a.d. 370, to succeed him in the See. His election is vehemently opposed,
but after much turmoil is at length accomplished.</p>
<p>To strengthen himself in his position, and surround himself with defenders of the orthodox
Faith, he obliges his brother Gregory, in spite of his emphatic protest, to undertake
the Bishopric of Nyssa4, a small town in the west of Cappadocia. When a friend expressed
his surprise that he had chosen so obscure a place for such a man as Gregory, he replied,
<note type="footnote">4 Now Nirse.</note>

<pb n="16"/>
that he did not desire his brother to receive distinction from the name of his See, but rather
to confer distinction upon it.</p>
<p>It was with the same feeling, and by the exercise of a like masterful will, that he forced
upon his friend Gregory Nazianzen the Bishopric of a still more obscure and unimportant
place, called Sasima. But Gregory highly resented the nomination, which unhappily led to
a lifelong estrangement.</p>
<p>It was about this time, too, that a quarrel had arisen between Basil and their uncle, another
Gregory, one of the Cappadocian Bishops. And here Gregory of Nyssa gave a striking
proof of the extreme simplicity and unreflectiveness of his character, which without guileful
intent yet led him into guile. Without sufficient consideration he was induced to practise a
deceit which was as irreconcileable with Christian principle as with common sense. In his
endeavours to set his brother and uncle at one, when previous efforts had been in vain, he
had recourse to an extraordinary method. He forged a letter, as if from their uncle, to Basil,
earnestly entreating reconciliation. The inevitable discovery of course only widened the
breach, and drew down on Gregory his brother’s indignant condemnation. The reconciliation,
however, which Gregory hoped for, was afterwards brought about.</p>
<p>Nor was this the only occasion on which Gregory needed Basil’s advice and reproof,
and protection from the consequences of his inexperienced zeal. After he had become
Bishop of Nyssa, with a view to render assistance to his brother he promoted the summoning
of Synods. But Basil’s wider experience told him that no good would come of such assemblies
under existing circumstances. Besides which he had reason to believe that Gregory would
be made the tool of factious and designing men. He therefore discouraged the attempt. At
another time Basil had to interpose his authority to prevent his brother joining in a mission
to Rome to invite the interference of Pope Damasus and the Western Bishops in the settlement
of the troubles at Antioch in consequence of the disputed election to the See. Basil
had himself experience of the futility of such application to Rome, from the want of sympathy
in the Pope and the Western Bishops with the troubles in the East. Nor would he, by such
application, give a handle for Rome’s assertion of supremacy, and encroachment on the
independence of the Eastern Church. The Bishopric of Nyssa was indeed to Gregory no bed
of roses. Sad was the contrast to one of his genre spirit, more fitted for studious retirement
and monastic calm than for controversies which did not end with the pen, between the
peaceful leisure of his retreat in Pontus and the troubles and antagonisms of his present
position. The enthusiasm of his faith on the subject of the Trinity and the Incarnation
brought upon him the full weight of Arian and Sabellian hostility, aggravated as it was by
the patronage of the Emperor. In fact his whole life at Nyssa was a series of persecutions.</p>
<p>A charge of uncanonical irregularity in his ordination is brought up against him by
certain Arian Bishops, and he is summoned to appear and answer them at a Synod at Ancyra.

<pb n="17"/>
To this was added the vexation of a prosecution by Demosthenes, the Emperor’s chef de
cuisine, on a charge of defalcation in the Church funds.</p>
<p>A band of soldiers is sent to fetch him to the Synod. The fatigue of the journey, and the
rough treatment of his conductors, together with anxiety of mind, produce a fever which
prevents his attendance. His brother Basil comes to his assistance. He summons another
Synod of orthodox Cappadocian Bishops, who dictate in their joint names a courteous letter,
apologising for Gregory’s absence from the Synod of Ancyra, and proving the falsehood of
the charge of embezzlement. At the same time he writes to solicit the interest of Astorgus,
a person of considerable influence at the Court, to save his brother from the indignity of
being dragged before a secular tribunal.</p>
<p>Apparently the application was unsuccessful. Demosthenes now obtains the holding
another Synod at Gregory’s own See of Nyssa, where he is summoned to answer the same
charges. Gregory refuses to attend. He is consequently pronounced contumacious, and deposed
from his Bishopric. His deposition is followed immediately by a decree of banishment
from the Emperor, a.d. 376. He retires to Seleucia. But his banishment did not secure him
from the malice and persecution of his enemies. He is obliged frequently to shift his quarters,
and is subjected to much bodily discomfort and suffering. From the consoling answers of
his friend Gregory of Nazianzen (for his own letters are lost), we learn the crushing effects
of all these troubles upon his gentle and sensitive spirit, and the deep despondency into
which he had fallen.</p>
<p>At length there is a happier turn of affairs. The Emperor Valens is killed, a.d. 378, and
with him Arianism ‘vanished in the crash of Hadrianople.’ He is succeeded by Gratian, the
friend and disciple of St. Ambrose. The banished orthodox Bishops are restored to their
Sees, and Gregory returns to Nyssa. In5 one of his letters, most probably to his brother Basil,
he gives a graphic description of the popular triumph with which his return was greeted.</p>
<p>But the joy of his restoration is overshadowed by domestic sorrows. His great brother,
to whom he owed so much, soon after dies, ere he is 50 years of age, worn out by his unparalleled
toils and the severity of his ascetic life. Gregory celebrated his death in a sincere
panegyric. Its high-flown style is explained by the rhetorical fashion of the time. The same
year another sorrow awaits him. After a separation of many years he revisits his sister
Macrina, at her convent in Pontus, but only to find her on her death-bed. We have an interesting
and graphic account of the scene between Gregory and his dying sister. To the last
this admirable woman appears as the great teacher of her family. She supplies her brother
with arguments for, and confirms his faith in, the resurrection of the dead; and almost reproves
him for the distress he felt at her departure, bidding him, with St. Paul, not to sorrow
as those who had no hope. After her decease an inmate of the convent, named Vestiana,
<note type="footnote">5 Epist. III. (Zacagni’s collection).</note>

<pb n="18"/>
brought to Gregory a ring, in which was a piece of the true Cross, and an iron cross, both
of which were found on the body when laying it out. One Gregory retained himself, the
other he gave to Vestiana. He buried his sister in the chapel at Annesi, in which her parents
and her brother Naucratius slept.</p>
<p>From henceforth the labours of Gregory have a far more extended range. He steps into
the place vacated by the death of Basil, and takes foremost rank among the defenders of the
Faith of Nicæa. He is not, however, without trouble still from the heretical party. Certain
Galatians had been busy in sowing the seeds of their heresy among his own people. He is
subjected, too, to great annoyance from the disturbances which arose out of the wish of the
people of Ibera in Pontus to have him as their Bishop. In that early age of the Church election
to a Bishopric, if not dependent on the popular voice, at least called forth the expression of
much popular feeling, like a contested election amongst ourselves. This often led to breaches
of the peace, which required military intervention to suppress them, as it appears to have
done on this occasion.</p>
<p>But the reputation of Gregory is now so advanced, and the weight of his authority as
an eminent teacher so generally acknowledged, that we find him as one of the Prelates at
the Synod of Antioch assembled for the purpose of healing the long-continued schisms in
that distracted See. By the same Synod Gregory is chosen to visit and endeavour to reform
the Churches of Arabia and Babylon, which had fallen into a very corrupt and degraded
state. He gives a lamentable account of their condition, as being beyond all his powers of
reformation. On this same journey he visits Jerusalem and its sacred scenes: it has been
conjectured that the Apollinarian heresy drew him thither. Of the Church of Jerusalem he
can give no better account than of those he had already visited. He expresses himself as
greatly scandalized at the conduct of the Pilgrims who visited the Holy City on the plea of
religion. Writing to three ladies, whom he had known at Jerusalem, he takes occasion, from
what he had witnessed there, to speak of the uselessness of pilgrimages as any aids to reverence
and faith, and denounces in the strongest terms the moral dangers to which all pilgrims,
especially women, are exposed.</p>
<p>This letter is so condemnatory of what was a common and authorized practice of the
medieval Church that6 Divines of the Latin communion have endeavoured, but in vain, to
deny its authenticity.</p>
<p>The name and character of Gregory had now reached the Imperial Court, where
Theodosius had lately succeeded to the Eastern Empire. As a proof of the esteem in which
he was then held, it is said that in his recent journey to Babylon and the Holy Land he travelled
with carriages provided for him by the Emperor.</p>
<note type="footnote">6 Notably Bellarmine: Gretser, the Jesuit, against the Calvinist Molino.</note>

<pb n="19"/>
<p>Still greater distinction awaits him. He is one of the hundred and fifty Bishops summoned
by Theodosius to the second OEcumenical Council, that of Constantinople, a.d. 381. To the
assembled Fathers he brings an7 instalment of his treatise against the Eunomian heresy,
which he had written in defence of his brother Basil’s positions, on the subject of the Trinity
and the Incarnation. This he first read to his friend Gregory Nazianzen, Jerome, and others.
Such was the influence he exercised in the Council that it is said, though this is very doubtful,
that the explanatory clauses added to the Nicene Creed are due to him. Certain, however,
it is that he delivered the inaugural address, which is not extant; further that he preached
the funeral oration, which has been preserved, on the death of Meletius, of Antioch, the first
President of the Council, who died at Constantinople; also that he preached at the enthronement
of Gregory Nazianzen in the capital. This oration has perished.</p>
<p>Shortly before the close of the Council, by a Constitution of the Emperor, issued from
Heraclea, Gregory is nominated as one of the Bishops who were to be regarded as the central
authorities of Catholic Communion. In other words, the primacy of Rome or Alexandria
in the East was to be replaced by that of other Sees, especially Constantinople. Helladius of
Cæsarea was to be Gregory’s colleague in his province. The connexion led to a misunderstanding.
As to the grounds of this there is much uncertainty. The account of it is entirely
derived from Gregory himself in his Letter to Flavian, and from his great namesake. Possibly
there were faults on both sides.</p>
<p>We do not read of Gregory being at the Synod, a.d. 382, which followed the great
Council of Constantinople. But we find him present at the Synod held the following year.</p>
<p>This same year we have proof of the continued esteem and favour shown him by the
Imperial Court. He is chosen to pronounce the funeral oration on the infant Princess
Pulcheria. And not long after that also on the death of the Empress Flaccilla, or Placidia,
herself. This last was a magnificent eulogy, but one, according to Tillemont, even surpassed
by that of Theodoret. This admirable and holy woman, a saint of the Eastern Church, fully
warranted all the praise that could be bestowed upon her. If her husband Theodosius did
not owe his conversion to Christianity to her example and influence, he certainly did his
adherence to the true Faith. It is one of the subjects of Gregory’s praise of her that by her
persuasion the Emperor refused to give an interview to the ‘rationalist of the fourth century,’
Eunomius.</p>
<p>Scarcely anything is known of the latter years of Gregory of Nyssa’s life. The last record
we have of him is that he was present at a Synod of Constantinople, summoned a.d. 394, by
Rufinus, the powerful prefect of the East, under the presidency of Nectarius. The rival claims
to the See of Bostra in Arabia had to be then settled; but perhaps the chief reason for summoning
this assembly was to glorify the consecration of Rufinus’ new Church in the suburbs.
<note type="footnote">7 See Note 1 to the Introductory Letter to the Treatise.</note>

<pb n="20"/>
It was there that Gregory delivered the sermon which was probably his last, wrongly entitled
‘On his Ordination.’ His words, which heighten the effect of others then preached, are humbly
compared to the blue circles painted on the new walls as a foil to the gilded dome above.
“The whole breathes a calmer and more peaceful spirit; the deep sorrow over heretics who
forfeit the blessings of the Spirit changes only here and there into the flashes of a short-lived
indignation.” (J. Rupp.)</p>
<p>The prophecy of Basil had come true. Nyssa was ennobled by the name of its bishop
appearing on the roll of this Synod, between those of the Metropolitans of Cæsarea and
Iconium. Even in outward rank he is equal to the highest. The character of Gregory could
not be more justly drawn than in the words of Tillemont (IX. p. 269). “Autant en effet, qu’on
peut juger de lui par ses écrits, c‘étoit un esprit doux, bon, facile, qui avec beaucoup d’élevation
et de lumière, avoit néanmois beaucoup de simplicité et de candeur, qui aimoit plus
le repos que l’action, et le travail du cabinet que le tumulte des affaires, qui avec cela étoit
sans faste, disposé à estimer et à louer les autres et à se mettre à dessous d’eux. Mais quoiqu’
il ne cherchât que le repos, nous avons vû que son zèle pour ses frères l’avoit souvent engagé
à de grands travaux, et que Dieu avait honoré sa simplicité en le faisant regarder comme le
maitre, le docteur, le pacificateur et l’arbitre des églises.”</p>
<p>His death (probably 395) is commemorated by the Greek Church on January 10, by the
Latin on March 9.</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<head>Chapter II.—His General Character as a Theologian.</head>
<p>“The first who sought to establish by rational considerations the whole complex of orthodox
doctrines.” So Ueberweg (History of Philosophy, p. 326) of Gregory of Nyssa. This
marks the transition from ante-Nicene times. Then, at all events in the hands of Origen,
philosophy was identical with theology. Now, that there is a ‘complex of orthodox doctrines’
to defend, philosophy becomes the handmaid of theology. Gregory, in this respect, has done
the most important service of any of the writers of the Church in the fourth century. He
treats each single philosophical view only as a help to grasp the formulæ of faith; and the
truth of that view consists with him only in its adaptability to that end. Notwithstanding
strong speculative leanings he does not defend orthodoxy either in the fashion of the Alexandrian
school or in the fashion of some in modern times, who put forth a system of
philosophy to which the dogmas of the Faith are to be accommodated.</p>
<p>If this be true, the question as to his attitude towards Plato, which is one of the first that
suggests itself, is settled. Against polytheism he does indeed seek to defend Christianity by
connecting it apologetically with Plato’s system. This we cannot be surprised at, considering
that the definitions of the doctrines of the Catholic Church were formed in the very place
where the last considerable effort of Platonism was made; but he by no means makes the
New Life in any way dependent on this system of philosophy. “We cannot speculate,” he
says (De Anim. et Resurrect.),<gap reason="omitted"/>“we must leave the Platonic car.” But still when he is convinced
that Plato will confirm doctrine he will, even in polemic treatises, adopt his view; for
instance, he seeks to grasp the truth of the Trinity from the Platonic account of our internal
consciousness, i.e. ψυχὴ, λόγος, νοῦς; because such a proof from consciousness is, to Gregory,
the surest and most reliable.</p>
<p>The “rational considerations,” then, by which Gregory would have established Christian
doctrine are not necessarily drawn from the philosophy of the time: nor, further, does he
seek to rationalize entirely all religious truth. In fact he resigns the hope of comprehending
the Incarnation and all the great articles. This is the very thing that distinguishes the Catholic
from the Eunomian. “Receiving the fact we leave untampered with the manner of the
creation of the Universe, as altogether secret and inexplicable8.” With a turn resembling the
view of Tertullian, he comes back to the conclusion that for us after all Religious Truth
consists in mystery. “The Church possesses the means of demonstrating these things: or
rather, she has faith, which is surer than demonstration9.” He developes the truth of the
Resurrection as much by the fulfilment of God’s promises as by metaphysics: and it has
been considered as one of the proofs that the treatise What is being ‘in the image of God’? is
<note type="footnote">8 Cp. Or. Cat. c. xi.</note>
<note type="footnote">9 In verba ‘faciamus hominem,’ I. p. 140.</note>

<pb n="22"/>
not his that this subordination of philosophical proof to the witness of the Holy Spirit is not
preserved in it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was a large field, larger even than in the next century, in which rationalizing
was not only allowable, but was even required of him. In this there are three
questions which Gregory has treated with particular fulness and originality. They are:—1.
Evil; 2. The relation between the ideal and the actual Man; 3. Spirit.</p>
<p>I. He takes, to begin with, Origen’s view of evil. Virtue and Vice are not opposed to each
other as two Existencies: but as Being is opposed to not-Being. Vice exists only as an absence.
But how did this arise?</p>
<p>In answering this question he seems sometimes to come very near Manicheism, and his
writings must be read very carefully, in order to avoid fixing upon him the groundless charge
that he leaves evil in too near connexion with Matter. But the passages10 which give rise to
this charge consist of comparisons found in his homilies and meditations; just as a modern
theologian might in such works make the Devil the same as Sin and Death. The only imperfection
in his view is that he is unable11 to regard evil as not only suffered but even permitted
by God. But this imperfection is inseparable from his time: for Manicheism was too near
and its opposition too little overcome for such a view to be possible for him; he could not
see that it is the only one able thoroughly to resist Dualism.</p>
<p>Evil with Gregory is to be found in the spontaneous proclivity of the soul towards
Matter: but not in Matter itself. Matter, therefore, in his eschatology is not to be burnt up
and annihilated: only soul and body have to be refined, as gold (this is a striking comparison)
is refined. He is very clear upon the relations between the three factors, body, matter, and
evil. He represents the mind as the mirror of the Archetypal Beauty: then below the mind
comes body (φύσις which is connected with mind and pervaded by it, and when thus
transfigured and beautified by it becomes itself the mirror of this mirror: and then this body
in its turn influences and combines Matter. The Beauty of the Supreme Being thus penetrates
all things: and as long as the lower holds on to the higher all is well. But if a rupture occurs
anywhere, then Matter, receiving no longer influence from above, reveals its own deformity,
and imparts something of it to body and, through that, to mind: for matter is in itself ‘a
shapeless unorganized thing12.’ Thus the mind loses the image of God. But evil began when
<note type="footnote">10 De Perf. Christiani Forma, III. p. 294, he calls the ‘Prince of darkness’ the author of sin and death: In Christi
Resurrect. III. p. 386, he calls Satan ‘the heart of the earth:’ and p. 387 identifies him with sin. ‘And so the real
wisdom visits that arrogant heart of the earth, so that the thought great in wickedness should vanish, and the
darkness should be lightened, u+0026c.’</note>
<note type="footnote">11 As expressed by S. Thomas Aquinas Summ. I. Qu. xix. Art. 9, Deo nec nolente, nec volente, sed permittente….
Deus neque vult fieri, neque vult non fieri, sed vult permittere mala fieri.</note>
<note type="footnote">12 De Virginit. c. xi.</note>

<pb n="23"/>
the rupture was made: and what caused that? When and how did the mind become separated
from God?</p>
<p>Gregory answers this question by laying it down as a principle, that everything created
is subject to change. The Uncreate Being is changeless, but Creation, since its very beginning
was owing to a change, i.e. a calling of the non-existent into existence, is liable to alter.
Gregory deals here with angelic equally as with human nature, and with all the powers in
both, especially with the will, whose virtual freedom he assumes throughout. That, too, was
created; therefore that, too, could change.</p>
<p>It was possible, therefore, that, first, one of the created spirits, and, as it actually
happened, he who was entrusted with the supervision of the earth, should choose to turn
his eyes away from the Good; he thus looked at a lower good; and so began to be envious
and to have πάθη. All evil followed in a chain from this beginning; according to the principle
that the beginning of anything is the cause of all that follows in its train.</p>
<p>So the Devil fell: and the proclivity to evil was introduced into the spiritual world. Man,
however, still looked to God and was filled with blessings (this is the ‘ideal man’ of Gregory).
But as when the flame has got hold of a wick one cannot dim its light by means of the flame
itself, but only by mixing water with the oil in the wick, so the Enemy effected the weakening
of God’s blessings in man by cunningly mixing wickedness in his will, as he had mixed it in
his own. From first to last, then, evil lies in the προαίρεσις and in nothing else.</p>
<p>God knew what would happen and suffered it, that He might not destroy our freedom,
the inalienable heritage of reason and therefore a portion of His image in us. 13He ‘gave
scope to evil for a nobler end.’ Gregory calls it a piece of “little mindedness” to argue from
evil either the weakness or the wickedness of God.</p>
<p>II. His remarks on the relation between the ideal and the actual Man are very interesting.
It is usual with the other Fathers, in speaking of man’s original perfection, to take the moment
of the first man’s residence in Paradise, and to regard the whole of human nature as there
represented by the first two human beings. Gregory is far removed from this way of looking
at the matter. With him human perfection is the ‘idea’ of humanity: he sees already in the
bodily-created Adam the fallen man. The present man is not to be distinguished from that
bodily Adam; both fall below the ideal type. Gregory seems to put the Fall beyond and before
the beginning of history. ‘Under the form of narrative Moses places before us mere doctrine14.’
The locus classicus about the idea and the reality of human nature is On the Making
of Man, I. p. 88f. He sketches both in a masterly way. He speaks of the division of the human
race into male and female as a ‘device’ (ἐπιτέχνησις), implying that it was not the first ‘organization’
(κατασκευή). He hints that the irrational element was actually provided by the
<note type="footnote">13 On Infants’ early Deaths, III. p. 336.</note>
<note type="footnote">14 Or. Cat. c. viii. D.</note>

<pb n="24"/>
Creator, Who foresaw the Fall and the Redemption, for man to sin in; as if man immediately
upon the creation of the perfect humanity became a mixed nature (spirit and flesh), and his
fall was not a mere accident, but a necessary consequence of this mixed nature. Adam must
have fallen: there was no perfect humanity in Paradise. In man’s mixed nature of spirit and
flesh nutrition is the basis of his sensation, and sensation is the basis of his thought; and so
it was inevitable that sin through this lower yet vital side of man should enter in. So ingrained
is the spirit with the flesh in the whole history of actual humanity that all the varieties of all
the souls that ever have lived or ever shall, arise from this very mixture; i.e. from the varying
degrees of either factor in each. But as Gregory’s view here touches, though in striking
contrast, on Origen’s, more will be said about it in the next chapter.</p>
<p>It follows from this that Gregory, as Clement and Basil before him, did not look upon
Original Sin as the accidental or extraordinary thing which it was afterwards regarded. ‘From
a man who is a sinner and subject to passion of course is engendered a man who is a sinner
and subject to passion: sin being in a manner born with him, and growing with his growth,
and not dying with it.’ And yet he says elsewhere, “An infant who is just born is not culpable,
nor does it merit punishment; just as he who has been baptized has no account to give of
his past sins, since they are forgiven,” and he calls infants ἀπόνηροι, ‘not having in the least
admitted the disease into their soul.’ But these two views can of course be reconciled; the
infant at the moment of its physical birth starts with sins forgotten, just as at the moment
of its spiritual birth it starts with sins forgiven. No actual sin has been committed. But then
its nature has lost the ἀπαθεία; the inevitable weakness of its ancestry is in it.</p>
<p>III. ‘Spirit.’ Speaking of the soul, Gregory asks, ‘How can that which is incomposite be
dissolved?’ i.e. the soul is spirit, and spirit is incomposite and therefore indestructible.</p>
<p>But care must be taken not to infer too much from this his favourite expression ‘spirit’
in connexion with the soul. ‘God is spirit’ too; and we are inclined to forget that this is no
more than a negative definition, and to imagine the human spirit of equal prerogative with
Deity. Gregory gives no encouragement to this; he distinctly teaches that, though the soul
is incomposite, it is not in the least independent of time and space, as the Deity is.</p>
<p>In fact he almost entirely drops the old Platonic division of the Universe into Intelligible
(spiritual) and Sensible, which helps to keep up this confusion between human and divine
‘spirit,’ and adopts the Christian division of Creator and Created. This difference between
Creator and Created is further figured by him as that between</p>
<p>1. The Infinite and The Finite.</p>
<p>2. The Changeless and The Changeable.</p>
<p>3. The Contradiction-less and The Contradictory.</p>
<p>The result of this is that the Spirit-world itself has been divided into Uncreate and Created.</p>

<pb n="25"/>
<p>With regard, then, to this created Spirit-world we find that Gregory, as Basil, teaches
that it existed, i.e. it had been created, before the work of the Six Days began. ‘God made all
that is, at once’ (ἀθρόως). This is only his translation of the verse, ‘In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth;’ the material for ‘heaven’ and ‘earth,’ i.e. spirits and chaos,
was made in a moment, but God had not yet spoken the successive Words of creation. The
souls of men, then, existed from the very beginning of creation, and in a determinate number;
for this is a necessary consequence of the ‘simultaneous creation.’ This was the case with
the Angels too, the other portion of the created Spirit-world. Gregory has treated the subject
of the Angels very fully. He considers that they are perfect: but their perfection too is contingent:
it depends on the grace of God and their own wills; the angels are free, and therefore
changeable. Their will necessarily moves towards something: at their first creation the
Beautiful alone solicited them. Man ‘a little lower than the Angels’ was perfect too; deathless,
passionless, contemplative. ‘The true and perfect soul is single in its nature, intellectual,
immaterial15.’ He was ‘as the Angels’ and if he fell, Lucifer fell too. Gregory will not say, as
Origen did, that human souls had a body when first created: rather, as we have seen, he
implies the contrary; and he came to be considered the champion that fought the doctrine
of the pre-existence of embodied souls. He seems to have been influenced by Methodius’
objections to Origen’s view. But his magnificent idea of the first man gives way at once to
something more Scriptural and at the same time more scientific; and his ideal becomes a
downright forecast of Realism.</p>
<p>Taking, however, the human soul as it is, he still continues, we often find, to compare
it with God. In his great treatise On the Soul and the Resurrection, he rests a great deal on
the parallel between the relation of man to his body, and that of God to the world.—‘The
soul is as a cord drawn out of mud; God draws to Himself what is His own.’—He calls the
human spirit ‘an influx of the divine in-breathing’ (Adv. Apollin. c. 12). Anger and desire
do not belong to the essence of the soul, he says: they are only among its varying states. The
soul, then, as separable from matter, is like God. But this likeness does not extend to the
point of identity. Incomprehensible, immortal, it is not uncreated. The distinction between
the Creator and the Created cannot be obliterated. The attributes of the Creator set down
above, i.e. that He is infinite, changeless, contradictionless, and so always good, U+0026c., can be
applied only catachrestically to some men, in that they resemble their Maker as a copy resembles
its original: but still, in this connexion, Gregory does speak of those ‘who do not
need any cleansing at all16,’ and the context forces us to apply these words to men. There
is no irony, to him or to any Father of the fourth century, in the words, ‘They that are whole
<note type="footnote">15 On the Making of Man, c. xiv.</note>
<note type="footnote">16 Or. Cat. c. xxvi.</note>

<pb n="26"/>
need not a physician.’ Although in the treatise On Virginity, where he is describing the development
of his own moral and religious life, he is very far from applying them to himself,
he nevertheless seems to recognize the fact that since Christianity began there are those to
whom they might apply.</p>
<p>There is also need of a certain amount of ‘rational considerations’ in advancing a Defence
and a Theory of Christianity. He makes this according to the special requirements of the
time in his Oratio Catechetica. His reasonings do not seem to us always convincing; but the
presence of a living Hellenism and Judaism in the world required them. These two phenomena
also explain what appears to us a great weakness in this work: namely, that he treats
Hellenism as if it were all speculation; Judaism as if it were all facts. These two religions
were too near and too practically opposed to each other for him to see, as we can now, by
the aid of a sort of science of religions, that every religion has its idea, and every religion
has its facts. He and all the first Apologists, with the spectacle of these two apparently opposite
systems before them, thought that, in arriving at the True Religion as well, all could be done
by considering facts; or all could be done by speculation. Gregory chose the latter method.
A Dogmatic in the modern sense, in which both the idea and the facts of Christianity flow
into one, could not have been expected of him. The Oratio Catechetica is a mere philosophy
of Christianity in detail written in the philosophic language of the time. Not only does he
refrain from using the historic proofs, i.e. of prophecy and type (except very sparingly and
only to meet an adversary), but his defence is insufficient from another point of view also;
he hardly uses the moral proofs either; he wanders persistently in metaphysics.</p>
<p>If he does not lean enough on these two classes of proofs, at all events that he does not
lean entirely on either, may be considered as a guarantee of his excellence as a theologian
pure and simple. But he is on the other hand very far from attempting a philosophic construction
of Christianity, as we have seen. Though akin to modern theologians in many
things, he is unlike those of them who would construct an a priori Christianity, in which
the relationship of one part to another is so close that all stands or falls together. Philosophic
deduction is with him only ‘a kind of instruction’ used in his apologetic works. On occasion
he shows a clear perception of the historic principle. “The supernatural character of the
Gospel miracles bears witness to their divine origin17.” He points, as Origen did, to the
continued possession of miraculous powers in the Church. Again, as regards moral proof,
there had been so much attempted that way by the Neo-Platonists that such proof could
not have exactly the same degree of weight attributed to it that it has now, at least by an
adherent of the newer Hellenism. Philostratus, Porphyry, Iamblichus had all tried to attract
attention to the holy lives of heathen sages. Yet to these, rough sketches as they were, the
Christian did oppose the Lives of the Saints: notably Gregory himself in the Life of Gregory

<pb n="27"/>
Thaumaturgus: as Origen before him (c. Celsum, passim) had shewn in detail the difference
in kind of Christian holiness.</p>
<p>His treatment of the Sacraments in the Oratio Catechetica is noteworthy. On Baptism
he is very complete: it will be sufficient to notice here the peculiar proof he offers that the
Holy Spirit is actually given in Baptism. It is the same proof, to start with, as that which establishes
that God came in the flesh when Christ came. Miracles prove this; (he is not
wanting here in the sense of the importance of History). If, then, we are persuaded that God
is here, we must allow also that truth is here: for truth is the mark of Deity. When, therefore,
God has said that He will come in a particular way, if called in a particular way, this must
be true. He is so called in Baptism: therefore He comes. (The vital importance of the doctrine
of the Trinity, upon which Gregory laboured for so many years, thus all comes from Baptism.)
Gregory would not confine the entire force of Baptism to the one ritual act. A resurrection
to a new immortal life is begun in Baptism, but owing to the weakness of nature this complete
effect is separated into stages or parts. With regard to the necessity of Baptism for salvation,
he says he does not know if the Angels receive the souls of the unbaptized; but he rather
intimates that they wander in the air seeking rest, and entreat in vain like the Rich Man. To
him who wilfully defers it he says, ‘You are out of paradise, O Catechumen!’</p>
<p>In treating the Sacrament of the Eucharist, Gregory was the first Father who developed
the view of transformation, for which transubstantiation was afterwards substituted to suit
the mediæval philosophy; that is, he put this view already latent into actual words. There is
a locus classicusin the Oratio Catechetica, c. 37.</p>
<p>“Therefore from the same cause as that by which the bread that was transformed in that
Body was changed to a divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case,
too, the grace of the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the
bread and was in a manner itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle, ‘is
sanctified by the word of God and prayer:’ not that it advances by the process of eating to
the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it at once is changed into the Body, by the
Word, as the Word Himself said, ‘This is My Body;’” and just above he had said: “Rightly do
we believe that now also the bread which is consecrated by the word of God is changed into
the body of God the Word.” This way of explaining the mystery of the Sacrament, i.e. from
the way bread was changed into the Word when Christ was upon earth, is compared by
Neander with another way Gregory had of explaining it, i.e. the heightened efficacy of the
bread is as the heightened efficacy of the baptismal water, the anointing oil18, U+0026c., a totally
different idea. But this, which may be called the metabatic view, is the one evidently most
present to his mind. In a fragment of his found in a Parisian ms.19, quoted with the Liturgies
<note type="footnote">18 In Sermon On the Baptism of Christ.</note>
<note type="footnote">19 A. 1560 fol.; also Antwerp, p. 1562 (Latinè).</note>

<pb n="28"/>
of James, Basil, Chrysostom, we also find it; “The consecrated bread is changed into the
body of the Word; and it is needful for humanity to partake of that.”</p>
<p>Again, the necessity of the Incarnation, drawn from the words “it was necessary that
Christ should suffer,” receives a rational treatment from him. There must ever be, from a
meditation on this, two results, according as the physical or the ethical element in Christianity
prevails, i.e. 1. Propitiation; 2. Redemption. The first theory is dear to minds fed upon the
doctrines of the Reformation, but it receives no countenance from Gregory. Only in the
book in which Moses’ Life is treated allegorically does he even mention it. The sacrifice of
Christ instead of the bloody sacrifices of the Old Testament is not his doctrine, He develops
his theory of the Redemption or Ransom (i.e. from the Devil), in the Oratio Catechetica.
Strict justice to the Evil One required it. But in his hands this view never degenerates, as
with some, into a mere battle, e.g. in Gethsemane, between the Rescuer and Enslaver.</p>
<p>So much has been said about Gregory’s inconsistencies, and his apparent inconsistencies
are indeed so many, that some attempt must be made to explain this feature, to some so
repulsive, in his works. One instance at all events can show how it is possible to reconcile
even the most glaring. He is not a one-sided theologian: he is not one of those who pass always
the same judgment upon the same subject, no matter with whom he has to deal. There could
not be a harsher contradiction than that between his statement about human generation in
the Oratio Catechetica, and that made in the treatises On Virginity and On the Making of
Man. In the O.C. everything hateful and undignified is removed from the idea of our birth;
the idea of πάθος is not applied; “only evil brings disgrace.” But in the other two Treatises
he represents generation as a consequence of the Fall. This contradiction arises simply from
the different standpoint in each. In the one case he is apologetic; and so he adopts a universally
recognised moral axiom. In the other he is the Christian theologian; the natural process,
therefore, takes its colouring from the Christian doctrine of the Fall. This is the standpoint
of most of his works, which are polemical, not apologetic. But in the treatise On the Soul
and the Resurrection he introduces even a third view about generation, which might be
called that of the Christian theosophist; i.e. generation is the means in the Divine plan for
carrying Humanity to its completion. Very similar is the view in the treatise On Infants’
Early Deaths; “the design of all births is that the Power which is above the universe may in
all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures conspiring to the same
end, by virtue of the same faculty operating in all; I mean, that of looking upon God.” Here
he is speaking to the purely philosophic instinct. It may be remarked that on this and all the
operations of Divine foreknowledge in vast world-wide relations he has constantly striking
passages, and deserves for this especially to be studied.</p>
<p>The style of Gregory is much more elegant than that of Basil: sometimes it may be called
eloquent. His occasional digressions did not strike ancient critics as a fault. To them he is
“sweet,” “bright,” “dropping pleasure into the ears.” But his love for splendour, combined

<pb n="29"/>
with the lateness of his Greek, make him one of the more difficult Church writers to interpret
accurately.</p>
<p>His similes and illustrations are very numerous, and well chosen. A few exceptions must,
perhaps, be made. He compares the mere professing Christian to the ape, dressed like a man
and dancing to the flute, who used to amuse the people in the theatre at Alexandria, but
once revealed during the performance its bestial nature, at the sight of food. This is hardly
worthy of a great writer, as Gregory was20. Especially happy are his comparisons in the
treatise On the Soul and Resurrection, by which metaphysical truths are expressed; and
elsewhere those by which he seeks to reach the due proportions of the truth of the Incarnation.
The chapters in his work against Eunomius where he attempts to depict the Infinite,
are striking. But what commends him most to modern taste is his power of description
when dealing with facts, situations, persons: he touches these always with a colour which is
felt to be no exaggeration, but the truth.</p>
<note type="footnote">20 His comparison of the hidden meaning of the proverb or parable (III. c. Eunom. p. 236) to the ‘turned up’
side of the peacock’s feather is beautiful in itself for language (e.g. ‘the varied painting of nature,’ ‘the half-circle
shining in the midst with its dye of purple,’ ‘the golden mist round the circle’): but it rather fails as a simile,
when applied to the other or the literal side, which cannot in the case of parables be said to ‘lack beauty and
tint’.</note>

<head>Chapter III.—His Origenism.</head>
<p>A true estimate of the position and value of Gregory as a Church teacher cannot be
formed until the question of his ‘Origenism,’ its causes and its quality, is cleared up. It is
well known that this charge began to be brought against his orthodoxy at all events after
the time of Justinian: nor could Germanus, the Patriarch of Constantinople in the next
century, remove it by the device of supposed interpolations of partizans in the interests of
the Eastern as against the Western Church: for such a theory, to be true, would still require
some hints at all events in this Father to give a colour to such interpolations. Moreover, as
will be seen, the points in which Gregory is most like Origen are portions of the very
groundwork of his own theology. The question, then, remains why, and how far, is he a
follower of Origen?</p>
<p>I. When we consider the character of his great forerunner, and the kind of task which
Gregory himself undertook, the first part of this question is easily answered. When Christian
doctrine had to be set forth philosophically, so as to be intelligible to any cultivated mind
of that time (to reconcile Greek philosophy with Christian doctrine was a task which Gregory
never dreamed of attempting), the example and leader in such an attempt was Origen; he
occupied as it were the whole horizon. He was the founder of theology; the very vocabulary
of it, which is in use now, is of his devising. So that Gregory’s language must have had, necessarily,
a close connexion with that of the great interpreter and apologist, who had explained
to his century the same truths which Gregory had to explain to his: this must have been the
case even if his mind had not been as spiritual and idealizing as Origen’s. But in some respects
it will be seen Gregory is even more an idealist than Origen himself. Alike, then, from purpose
and tradition as from sympathy he would look back to Origen. Though a gulf was between
them, and, since the Council of Nicæa, there were some things that could come no more
into controversy, Gregory saw, where the Church had not spoken, with the same eyes as
Origen: he uses the same keys as he did for the problems which Scripture has not solved;
he uses the same great weapon of allegory in making the letter of Scripture give up the
spiritual treasures. It could not have been otherwise when the whole Christian religion,
which Gregory was called on to defend as a philosophy, had never before been systematically
so defended but by Origen; and this task, the same for both, was presented to the same type
of mind, in the same intellectual atmosphere. It would have been strange indeed if Gregory
had not been a pupil at least (though he was no blind follower) of Origen.</p>
<p>If we take for illustration of this the most vital point in the vast system, if system it can
be called, of Origen, we shall see that he had traced fundamental lines of thought, which
could not in that age be easily left. He asserts the virtual freedom of the human will, in every
stage and condition of human existence. The Greek philosophy of the third century, and
the semi-pagan Gnosticism, in their emanational view of the world, denied this freedom.

<pb n="31"/>
With them the mind of man, as one of the emanations of Deity itself, was, as much as the
matter of which the world was made, regulated and governed directly from the Source
whence they both flowed. Indeed every system of thought, not excepting Stoicism, was
struck with the blight of this fatalism. There was no freedom for man at all but in the system
which Origen was drawing from, or rather reading into, the Scriptures. No Christian
philosopher who lived amongst the same counter-influences as Origen could overlook this
starting-point of his system; he must have adopted it, even if the danger of Pelagianism had
been foreseen in it; which could not have been the case.</p>
<p>Gregory adopted it, with the other great doctrine which in the mind of Origen accompanied
it; i.e., that evil is caused, not by matter, but by the act of this free will of man; in
other words, by sin. Again the fatalism of all the emanationists had to be combated as to
the nature and necessity of evil. With them evil was some inevitable result of the Divine
processes; it abode at all events in matter, and human responsibility was at an end. Greek
philosophy from first to last had shewed, even at its best, a tendency to connect evil with
the lower φύσις. But now, in the light of revelation, a new truth was set forth, and repeated
again and again by the very men who were inclined to adopt Plato’s rather Dualistic division
of the world into the intelligible and sensible. ‘Evil was due to an act of the will of man.’
Moreover it could no longer be regarded per se: it was relative, being a ‘default,’ or ‘failure,’
or ‘turning away from the true good’ of the will, which, however, was always free to rectify
this failure. It was a στέρησις,—loss of the good; but it did not stand over against the good
as an independent power. Origen contemplated the time when evil would cease to exist;
‘the non-existent cannot exist for ever:’ and Gregory did the same.</p>
<p>This brings us to yet another consequence of this enthusiasm for human freedom and
responsibility, which possessed Origen, and carried Gregory away. The ἀποκατάστασις τῶν
πάντων has been thought21, in certain periods of the Church, to have been the only piece
of Origenism with which Gregory can be charged. [This of course shows ignorance of the
kind of influence which Gregory allowed Origen to have over him; and which did not require
him to select even one isolated doctrine of his master.] It has also brought him into more
suspicion than any other portion of his teaching. Yet it is a direct consequence of the view
of evil, which he shares with Origen. If evil is the non-existent, as his master says, a
στέρησις,22 as he says, then it must pass away. It was not made by God; neither is it selfsubsisting.</p>
<p>But when it has passed away, what follows? That God will be “all in all.” Gregory accepts
the whole of Origen’s explanation of this great text. Both insist on the impossibility of God
being in ‘everything,’ if evil still remains. But this is equivalent to the restoration to their
<note type="footnote">21 Cf. Dallæus, de poenis et satisfactionibus, I. IV. c. 7, p. 368.</note>
<note type="footnote">22 Cf. De An. et Resurr., 227 C.D.</note>

<pb n="32"/>
primitive state of all created spirits. Still it must be remembered that Origen required many
future stages of existence before all could arrive at such a consummation: with him there is
to be more than one ‘next world;’ and even when the primitive perfection is reached, his
peculiar view of the freedom of the will, as an absolute balance between good and evil, would
admit the possibility of another fall. ‘All may be saved; and all may fall.’ How the final Sabbath
shall come in which all wills shall rest at last is but dimly hinted at in his writings. With
Gregory, on the other hand, there are to be but two worlds: the present and the next; and
in the next the ἀποκατάστασις τῶν πάντων must be effected. Then, after the Resurrection,
the fire ἀκοίμητος, αἰωνιος, as he continually calls it, will have to do its work. ‘The avenging
flame will be the more ardent the more it has to consume’ (De Animâ et Resurr., p. 227).
‘But at last the evil will be annihilated, and the bad saved by nearness to the good.’ There is
to rise a giving of thanks from all nature. Nevertheless23 passages have been adduced from
Gregory’s writings in which the language of Scripture as to future punishment is used without
any modification, or hint of this universal salvation. In the treatise, De Pauperibus Amandis,
II. p. 240, he says of the last judgment that God will give to each his due; repose eternal to
those who have exercised pity and a holy life; but the eternal punishment of fire for the harsh
and unmerciful: and addressing the rich who have made a bad use of their riches, he says,
‘Who will extinguish the flames ready to devour you and engulf you? Who will stop the
gnawings of a worm that never dies?’ Cf. also Orat. 3, de Beatitudinibus, I. p. 788: contra
Usuarios, II. p. 233: though the hortatory character of these treatises makes them less important
as witnesses.</p>
<p>A single doctrine or group of doctrines, however, may be unduly pressed in accounting
for the influence of Origen upon a kindred spirit like Gregory. Doubtless fragments of Origen’s
teaching, mere details very often, were seized upon and appropriated by others; they
were erected into dogmas and made to do duty for the whole living fabric; and even those
details were sometimes misunderstood. ‘24What he had said with a mind full of thought,
others took in the very letter.’ Hence arose the evil of ‘Origenism,’ so prevalent in the century
in which Gregory lived. Different ways of following him were found, bad and good. Even
the Arians could find in his language now and then something they could claim as their
own. But as Rupp well says, ‘Origen is not great by virtue of those particular doctrines, which
are usually exhibited to the world as heretical by weak heads who think to take the measure
of everything with the mere formulæ of orthodoxy. He is great by virtue of one single thought,
i.e. that of bringing philosophy into union with religion, and thereby creating a theology.
With Clement of Alexandria this thought was a mere instinct: Origen gave it consciousness:
and so Christendom began to have a science of its own.’ It was this single purpose, visible

<pb n="33"/>
in all Origen wrote, that impressed itself so deeply upon Gregory. He, too, would vindicate
the Scriptures as a philosophy. Texts, thanks to the labours of Origen as well as to the
councils of the Church, had now acquired a fixed meaning and an importance that all could
acknowledge. The new spiritual philosophy lay within them; he would make them speak its
language. Allegory was with him, just as with Origen, necessary, in order to find the Spirit
which inspires them. The letter must not impose itself upon us and stand for more than it
is worth; just as the practical experience of evil in the world must not blind us to the fact
that it is only a passing dispensation. If only the animus and intention is regarded, we may
say that all that Gregory wrote was Origenistic.</p>
<p>II. But nevertheless much had happened in the interval of 130 years that divides them
and this leads us to consider the limits which the state of the Church, as well as Gregory’s
own originality and more extended physical knowledge, placed upon the complete filling
in of the outlines sketched by the master. First and chiefly, Origen’s doctrine of the pre-existence
of the soul could not be retained; and we know that Gregory not only abandoned it,
but attacked it with all his powers of logic in his treatise, De Animâ et Resurrectione: for
which he receives the applause of the Emperor Justinian. Souls, according to Origen, had
pre-existed from eternity: they were created certainly, but there never was a time when they
did not exist: so that the procession even of the Holy Spirit could in thought only be prior
to their existence. Then a failure of their free wills to grasp the true good, and a consequent
cooling of the fire of love within them, plunged them in this material bodily existence, which
their own sin made a suffering one. This view had certainly great merits: it absolved the
Deity from being the author of evil, and so was a ‘théodicée;’ it entirely got rid of the two
rival principles, good and evil, of the Gnostics; and it avoided the seeming incongruity of
what was to last for ever in the future being not eternal in the past. Why then was it rejected?
Not only because of the objection urged by Methodius, that the addition of a body would
be no remedy but rather an increase of the sin; or that urged amongst many others by
Gregory, that a vice cannot be regarded as the precursor of the birth of each human soul
into this or into other worlds; but more than that and chiefly, because such a doctrine contravened
the more distinct views now growing up as to what the Christian creation was,
and the more careful definitions also of the Trinity now embodied in the creeds. In fact the
pre-existence of the soul was wrapped up in a cosmogony that could no longer approve itself
to the Christian consciousness. In asserting the freedom of the will, and placing in the will
the cause of evil, Origen had so far banished emanationism; but in his view of the eternity
of the world, and in that of the eternal pre-existence of souls which accompanied it, he had
not altogether stamped it out. He connects rational natures so closely with the Deity that
each individual λόγος seems almost, in a Platonic way, to lie in the Divine which25 he styles
<note type="footnote">25 c. Cels. VI. 64.</note>

<pb n="34"/>
οὐσία οὐσιῶν, ἰδέα ἰδεῶν. They are ‘partial brightnesses (ἀπαυγάσμαπα) of the glory of
God.’ He26 allows them, of course, to have been created in the Scriptural sense of that word,
which is certainly an advance upon Justin; but his creation is not that distinct event in time
which Christianity requires and the exacter treatment of the nature of the Divine Persons
had now developed. His creation, both the intelligible and visible world, receives from him
an eternity which is unnatural and incongruous in relation to his other speculations and
beliefs: it lingers, Tithonus-like, in the presence of the Divine Persons, without any meaning
and purpose for its life; it is the last relic of Paganism, as it were, in a system which is otherwise
Christian to the very core. His strenuous effort to banish all ideas of time, at all events
from the intelligible world, ended in this eternal creation of that world; which seemed to
join the eternally generated Son too closely to it, and gave occasion to the Arians to say that
He too was a κτίσμα. This eternal pre-existence in fact almost destroyed the idea of creation,
and made the Deity in a way dependent on His own world. Athanasius, therefore, and his
followers were roused to separate the divinity of the Son from everything created. The relation
of the world to God could no longer be explained in the same terms as those which they
employed to illustrate the relations between the Divine Persons; and when once the doctrine
of the consubstantiality of the Father and Son had been accepted and firmly established
there could be no more favour shown by the defenders of that doctrine to the merely Platonic
view of the nature and origin of souls and of matter.</p>
<p>Amongst the defenders of the Creed of Nicæa, Gregory, we know, stands well-nigh
foremost. In his long and numerous treatises on the Trinity he employs every possible argument
and illustration to show the contents of the substance of the Deity as transcendent,
incommunicable to creation per se. Souls cannot have the attributes of Deity. Created spirits
cannot claim immediate kindred with the Λόγος. So instead of the Platonic antithesis of the
intelligible and sensible world, which Origen adopted, making all equal in the intelligible
world, he brings forward the antithesis of God and the world. He felt too that that antithesis
answers more fully not only to the needs of the Faith in the Trinity daily growing more exact
and clear, but also to the facts of the Creation, i.e. its variety and differences. He gives up
the preexistence of the rational soul; it will not explain the infinite variety observable in
souls. The variety, again, of the material world, full as it is of the miracles of divine power,
cannot have been the result of the chance acts of created natures embodying themselves
therein, which the theory of pre-existence supposes. God and the created world (of spirits
and matter) are now to be the factors in theology; although Gregory does now and then, for
mere purposes of illustration, divide the Universe still into the intelligible and the sensible.</p>
<p>When once pre-existence was given up, the parts of the soul could be more closely united
to each other, because the lower and higher were in their beginning no longer separated by

a gulf of ages. Accordingly Gregory, reducing the three parts of man which Origen had used
to the simpler division into visible and invisible (sensible and intelligible), dwells much
upon the intimate relation between the two and the mutual action of one upon the other.
Origen had retained the trichotomy of Plato which other Greek Fathers also, with the
sanction, as they supposed, of S. Paul (1 Thess. v. 23), had adopted. ‘Body,’ ‘soul,’ and
‘spirit,’ or Plato’s ‘body,’ ‘unreasoning’ and ‘reasoning soul,’ had helped Origen to explain
how the last, the pre-existent soul (the spirit, or the conscience27, as he sometimes calls it)
could ever have come to live in the flesh. The second, the soul proper, is as it were a mediating
ground on which the spirit can meet the flesh. The celestial mind, ‘the real man fallen from
on high,’ rules by the power of conscience or of will over this soul, where the merely animal
functions and the natural appetites reside; and through this soul over the body. How the
celestial mind can act at all upon this purely animal soul which lies between it and the body,
Origen leaves unexplained. But this division was necessary for him, in order to represent
the spirit as remaining itself unchanged in its heavenly nature, though weakened by its long
captivity in the body. The middle soul (in which he sometimes places the will) is the scene
of contamination and disorder; the spirit is free, it can always rejoice at what is well done
in the soul, and yet is not touched by the evil in it; it chooses, convicts, and punishes. Such
was Origen’s psychology. But an intimate connexion both in birth and growth between all
the faculties of man is one of Gregory’s most characteristic thoughts, and he gave up this
trichotomy, which was still, however, retained by some Greek fathers, and adopted the
simpler division mentioned above in order more clearly and concisely to show the mutual
play of spirit and body upon each other. There was soon, too, another reason why this trichotomy
should be suspected. It was a second time made the vehicle of error. Apollinaris
adopted it, in order to expound that the Divine Λόγος took the place, in the tripartite soul
of Christ, of the ‘reasonable soul’ or spirit of other men. Gregory, in pressing for a simpler
treatment of man’s nature, thus snatched a vantage-ground from a sagacious enemy. His
own psychology is only one instance of a tendency which runs through the whole of his
system, and which may indeed be called the dominating thought with which he approached
every question; he views each in the light of form and matter; spirit penetrating and controlling
body, body answering to spirit and yet at the same time supplying the nutriment
upon which the vigour and efficacy of spirit, in this world at least, depends. This thought
underlies his view of the material universe and of Holy Scripture, as well as of man’s nature.
With regard to the last he says, ‘the intelligible cannot be realized in body at all, except it be
commingled with sensation;’ and again, ‘as there can be no sensation without a material
substance, so there can be no exercise of the power of thought without sensation28.’ The

<pb n="36"/>
spiritual or intelligent part of man (which he calls by various names, such as ‘the inner man,’
the ψυχὴ λογικὴ, νοῦς or διάνοια, τὸ ζωοποιὸν αἴτιον, or simply ψυχὴ as throughout the
treatise On the Soul), however alien in its essence from the bodily and sentient part, yet no
sooner is united with this earthly part than it at once exerts power over it. In fact it requires
this instrument before it can reach its perfection. ‘Seeing, then, man is a reasoning animal
of a certain kind, it was necessary that the body should be prepared as an instrument appropriate
to the needs of his reason29.’ So closely has this reason been united with the senses
and the flesh that it performs itself the functions of the animal part; it is the ‘mind’ or
‘reason’ itself that sees, hears, U+0026c.; in fact the exercise of mind depends on a sound state of
the senses and other organs of the body; for a sick body cannot receive the ‘artistic’ impressions
of the mind and, so, the mind remains inoperative. This is enough to show how far
Gregory had got from pre-existence and the ‘fall into the prison of the flesh.’</p>
<p>His own theory of the origin of the soul, or at least that to which he visibly inclines, is
stated in the treatise, De Animâ et Resurrectione, p. 241. It is that of Tertullian and some
Greek Fathers also: and goes by the name of ‘traducianism.’ The soul is transmitted in the
generating seed. This of course is the opposite pole to Origen’s teaching, and is inconsistent
with Gregory’s own spiritualism. The other alternative, Creationism, which a number of
the orthodox adopted, namely that souls are created by God at the moment of conception,
or when the body of the foetus is already formed, was not open to him to adopt; because,
according to him, in idea the world of spirits was made, and in a determinate number, along
with the world of unformed matter by the one creative act ‘in the beginning.’ In the plan of
the universe, though not in reality as with Origen, all souls are already created. So the life
of humanity contains them: when the occasion comes they take their beginning along with
the body which enshrines them, but are not created then any more than that body. Such
was the compromise between spiritualism and materialism to which Gregory was driven
by the difficulties of the subject. Origen with his eye unfalteringly fixed upon the ideal world,
and unconscious of the practical consequences that might be drawn from his teaching, cut
the knot with his eternal pre-existence of souls, which avoided at once the alleged absurdity
of creationism and the grossness of traducianism. But the Church, for higher interests still
than those of pure idealism, had to reject that doctrine; and Gregory, with his extended
knowledge in physic and his close observation of the intercommunion of mind and body,
had to devise or rather select a theory which, though a makeshift, would not contradict

his treatise which Locke might have written we come upon others which are exactly the
teaching of Berkeley. There is a passage in the De Animâ et Resurrectione where he deals
with the question how an intelligent Being could have created matter, which is neither intelligent
or intelligible. But what if matter is only a concourse of qualities, ἔννοιαι, or ψιλὰ
νοήματα as he elsewhere calls them? Then there would be no difficulty in understanding
the manner of creation. But even about this we can say so much, i.e. that not one of those
things which we attribute to body is itself body: neither figure, nor colour, nor weight, nor
extension, nor quantity, nor any other qualifying notion whatever: but every one of them
is a thought: it is the combination of them all into a single whole that constitutes body. Seeing,
then, that these several qualifications which complete the particular body are grasped by
thought alone, and not by sense, and that the Deity is a thinking being, what trouble can it
be to such a thinking agent to produce the thoughts whose mutual combination generate
for us the substance of that body? and in the treatise, De Hom. Opif., c. 24, the intelligible
φύσις is said to produce the intelligible δυνάμεις, and the concourse of these δυνάμεις brings
into being the material nature. The body itself, he repeats (contra Fatum, p. 67), is not a real
substance; it is a soulless, unsubstantial thing. The only real creation is that of spirits. Even
Origen did not go so far as that Matter with him, though it exists by concomitance and not
by itself, nevertheless really exists. He avoided a rock upon which Gregory runs; for with
Gregory not only matter but created spirit as well vanish in idealism. There remain with
him only the νοούμενα and God.</p>
<p>This transcendent idealism embarrasses him in many ways, and makes his theory of
the soul full of inconsistency. (1) He will not say unhesitatingly whether that pure humanity
in the beginning created in the image of God had a body or not like ours. Origen at all events
says that the eternally pre-existing spirits were invested with a body, even before falling into
the sensible world. But Gregory, while denying the pre-existence of souls in the sense of
Origen, yet in many of his treatises, especially in the De Hom. Opificio, seems to point to a
primitive humanity, a predeterminate number of souls destined to live in the body though
they had not yet lived, which goes far beyond Origen’s in its ideal character. “When Moses,”
Gregory says, “speaks of the soul as the image of God, he shows that all that is alien to God
must be excluded from our definition of the soul; and a corporal nature is alien to God.”
He points out that God first ‘made man in His own image,’ and after that made them male
and female; so that there was a double fashioning of our nature, ἥ τε πρὸς τὸ θεῖον
ὁμοιωμένη, ἥ τε πρὸς τὴν διαφορὰν ταύτην (i.e. male and female) διηρημένη. On the other
hand, in the Oratio Catechetica, which contains certainly his more dogmatic statement on
every point, this ideal and passionless humanity is regarded as still in the future: and it is
represented that man’s double-nature is actually the very centre of the Divine Councils, and
not the result of any mistake or sin; man’s soul from the very first was commingled
(ἀνάκρασις is Gregory’s favourite word) with a body, in order that in him, as representing

<pb n="38"/>
every stage of living things, the whole creation, even in its lowest part, might share in the
divine. Man, as the paragon of animals, was necessary, in order that the union might be effected
between two otherwise irreconcilable worlds, the intelligible and the sensible. Though,
therefore, there was a Fall at last, it was not the occasion of man’s receiving a body similar
to animals; that body was given him at the very first, and was only preparatory to the Fall,
which was foreseen in the Divine Councils and provided for. Both the body and the Fall
were necessary in order that the Divine plan might be carried out, and the Divine glory
manifested in creation. In this view the “coats of skins” which Gregory inherits from the
allegorical treasures of Origen are no longer merely the human body itself, as with Origen,
but all the passions, actions, and habits of that body after the Fall, which he sums up in the
generic term πάθη. If, then, there is to be any reconciliation between this and the former
view of his in which the pure unstained humanity, the ‘image of God,’ is differentiated by
a second act of creation as it were into male and female, we must suppose him to teach that
immediately upon the creation in God’s image there was added all that in human nature is
akin to the merely animal world. In that man was God’s image, his will was free, but in that
he was created, he was able to fall from his high estate; and God, foreseeing the Fall, at once
added the distinction of sex, and with it the other features of the animal which would befit
the fall; but with the purpose of raising thereby the whole creation. But two great counterinfluences
seem always to be acting upon Gregory; the one sympathy with the speculations
of Origen, the other a tendency to see even with a modern insight into the closeness of the
intercommunion between soul and body. The results of these two influences cannot be al-
together reconciled. His ideal and his actual man, each sketched with a skilful and discriminating
hand, represent the interval that divides his aspirations from his observations: yet
both are present to his mind when he writes about the soul. (2) He does not alter, as Origen
does, the traditional belief in the resurrection of the body, and yet his idealism, in spite of
his actual and strenuous defence of it in the carefully argued treatise On the Soul and Resurrection,
renders it unnecessary, if not impossible. We know that his faith impelled Origen,
too, to30 contend for the resurrection of the flesh: yet it is an almost forced importation into
the rest of his system. Our bodies, he teaches, will rise again: but that which will make us
the same persons we were before is not the sameness of our bodies (for they will be ethereal,
angelic, uncarnal, U+0026c.) but the sameness of a λόγος within them which never dies (λόγος
τις ἔγκειται τῷ σώματι, ἀφ᾽ οὗ μὴ φθειρομένου ἐγείρεται τὸ σῶμα ἐν ἀφθαρσίU+0026 139·, c.
Cels. v. 23). Here we have the λόγοι σπερματικοὶ; which Gregory objected to as somehow
connected in his mind with the infinite plurality of worlds. Yet his own account of the Resurrection
of the flesh is nothing but Origenism, mitigated by the suppression of these λόγοι.
With him, too, matter is nothing, it is a negative thing that can make and effect nothing:
<note type="footnote">30 He does so De Principiis I. præf. 5. C. Cels. II. 77, VIII. 49 sq.</note>

<pb n="39"/>
the soul, the ζωτικὴ δύναμις does everything; it is gifted by him with a sort of ubiquity after
death. ‘Nothing can break its sympathetic union with the particles of the body.’ It is not a
long and difficult study for it to discern in the mass of elements that which is its own from
that which is not its own. ‘It watches over its property, as it were, until the Resurrection,
when it will clothe itself in them anew31.’ It is only a change of names: the λόγος has become
this ζωτικὴ δύναμις or ψυχὴ, which seems itself, almost unaided, to effect the whole Resurrection.
Though he teaches as against Origen that the ‘elements’ are the same ‘elements,’
the body the same body as before, yet the strange importance both in activity and in substance
which he attaches to the ψυχὴ even in the disembodied state seems to render a Resurrection
of the flesh unnecessary. Here, too, his view of the plan of Redemption is at variance with
his idealistic leanings. While Origen regarded the body, as it now is, as part of that ‘vanity’
placed upon the creature which was to be laid aside at last, Gregory’s view of the design of
God in creating man at all absolutely required the Resurrection of the flesh32 (ὡς ἂν
συνεπαρθείη τῷ θείU+0026 251· τὸ γήU+0026 187·νον). Creation was to be saved by man’s carrying his
created body into a higher world: and this could only be done by a resurrection of the flesh
such as the Church had already set forth in her creed.</p>
<p>Again, however, after parting with Origen upon this point, he meets him in the ultimate
contemplation of Christ’s glorified humanity and of all glorified bodies. Both steadily refuse
at last ‘to know Christ according to the flesh.’ They depict His humanity as so absorbed in
deity that all traces of His bodily nature vanish; and as with Christ, so finally with His true
followers. This is far indeed from the Lamb that was slain, and the vision of S. John. In this
heaven of theirs all individual or generic differences between rational creatures necessarily
cease.</p>
<p>Great, then, as are their divergences, especially in cosmogony, their agreements are
maintained throughout. Gregory in the main accepts Origen’s teaching, as far as he can accommodate
it to the now more outspoken faith of the Church. What33 Redepenning summarises
as the groundplan of Origen’s whole way of thinking, Gregory has, with the necessary
changes, appropriated. Both regard the history of the world as a movement between a beginning
and an end in which are united every single spiritual or truly human nature in the
world, and the Divine nature. This interval of movement is caused by the falling away of
the free will of the creature from the divine: but it will come to an end, in order that the
former union may be restored. In this summary they would differ only as to the closeness
of the original union. Both, too, according to this, would regard ‘man’ as the final cause,
and the explanation, and the centre of God’s plan in creation.</p>

<p>Even in the special sphere of theology which the later needs of the Church forced into
prominence, and which Gregory has made peculiarly his own, that of the doctrine of the
Trinity, Gregory employs sometimes a method which he has caught from Origen. Origen
supposes, not so much, as Plato did, that things below are images of things above, as that
they have certain secret analogies or affinities with them. This is perhaps after all only a
peculiar application for his own purpose of Plato’s theory of ideas. There are mysterious
sympathies between the earth and heaven. We must therefore read within ourselves the reflection
of truths which are too much beyond our reach to know in themselves. With regard
to the attributes of God this is more especially the case. But Origen never had the occasion
to employ this language in explaining the mystery of the Trinity. Gregory is the first Father
who has done so. He finds a key to it in the34 triple nature of our soul. The νοῦς, the λόγος,
and the soul, form within us a unity such as that of the Divine hypostases. Gregory himself
confesses that such thoughts about God are inadequate, and immeasurably below their object:
but he cannot be blamed for employing this method, as if it was entirely superficial. Not
only does this instance illustrate trinity in unity, but we should have no contents for our
thought about the Father, Son, and Spirit, if we found no outlines at all of their nature
within ourselves. Denis35 well says that the history of the doctrine of the Trinity confirms
this: for the advanced development of the theory of the λόγος, a purely human attribute in
the ancient philosophy, was the cause of the doctrine of the Son being so soon and so widely
treated: and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit came into prominence only when He began to
be regarded as the principle of the purely human or moral life, as Love, that is, or Charity.
Gregory, then, had reason in recommending even a more systematic use of the method
which he had received from Origen: ‘Learn from the things within thee to know the secret
of God; recognise from the Triad within thee the Triad by means of these matters which
you realise: it is a testimony above and more sure than that of the Law and the Gospel36.’</p>
<p>He carries out elsewhere also more thoroughly than Origen this method of reading
parables. He is an actual Mystic in this. The mysterious but real correspondences between
earth and heaven, upon which, Origen had taught, and not upon mere thoughts or the artifices
of language, the truth of a parable rests, Gregory employed, in order to penetrate the
meaning of the whole of external nature. He finds in its facts and appearances analogies
with the energies, and through them with the essence, of God. They are not to him merely
indications of the wisdom which caused them and ordered them, but actual symptoms of
the various energies which reside in the essence of the Supreme Being; as though that essence,
having first been translated into the energies, was through them translated into the material

creation; which was thus an earthly language saying the same thing as the heavenly language,
word for word. The whole world thus became one vast allegory37: and existed only to
manifest the qualities of the Unseen. Akin to this peculiar development of the parable is
another characteristic of his, which is alien to the spirit of Origen; his delight in natural
scenery, his appreciation of it, and power of describing it.</p>
<p>With regard to the question, so much agitated, of the ᾽Αποκατάστασις, it may be said
that not Gregory only but Basil and Gregory Nazianzen also have felt the influence of their
master in theology, Origen. But it is due to the latter to say that though he dwells much on
the “all in all” and insists much more on the sanctifying power of punishment than on the
satisfaction owed to Divine justice, yet no one could justly attribute to him, as a doctrine,
the view of a Universal Salvation. Still these Greek Fathers, Origen and ‘the three great
Cappadocians,’ equally showed a disposition of mind that left little room for the discussions
that were soon to agitate the West. Their infinite hopes, their absolute confidence in the
goodness of God, who owes it to Himself to make His work perfect, their profound faith in
the promises and sacrifice of Christ, as well as in the vivifying action of the Holy Spirit, make
the question of Predestination and Grace a very simple one with them. The word Grace
occurs as often in them as in Augustine: but they do not make original sin a monstrous innovation
requiring a remedy of a peculiar and overwhelming intensity. Passion indeed
seems to Gregory of Nyssa himself one of the essential elements of the human soul. He
borrows from the naturalists many principles of distinction between classes of souls and
lives: he insists incessantly on the intimate connexion between the physical growth and the
development of the reason, and on the correlation between the one and the other: and we
arrive at the conclusion that man in his eyes, as in Clement’s, was not originally perfect,
except in possibility; that being at once reasoning and sentient he must perforce feel within
himself the struggle of reason and passion, and that it was inevitable that sin should enter
into the world: it was a consequence of his mixed nature. This mixed nature of the first man
was transmitted to his descendants. Here, though he stands apart from Origen on the
question of man’s original perfection, he could not have accepted the whole Augustinian
scheme of original sin: and Grace as the remedy with him consists rather in the purging this
mixed nature, than in the introduction into it of something absolutely foreign. The result,
as with all the Greek Fathers, will depend on the co-operation of the free agent in this remedial
work. Predestination and the ‘bad will’ are excluded by the Possibility and the ‘free
will’ of Origen and Gregory.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—His Teaching on the Holy Trinity.</head>
<p>To estimate the exact value of the work done by S. Gregory in the establishment of the
doctrine of the Trinity and in the determination, so far as Eastern Christendom is concerned,
of the terminology employed for the expression of that doctrine, is a task which can hardly
be satisfactorily carried out. His teaching on the subject is so closely bound up with that of
his brother, S. Basil of Cæsarea,—his “master,” to use his own phrase,—that the two can
hardly be separated with any certainty. Where a disciple, carrying on the teaching he has
himself received from another, with perhaps almost imperceptible variations of expression,
has extended the influence of that teaching and strengthened its hold on the minds of men,
it must always be a matter of some difficulty to discriminate accurately between the services
which the two have rendered to their common cause, and to say how far the result attained
is due to the earlier, how far to the later presentment of the doctrine. But the task of so discriminating
between the work of S. Basil and that of S. Gregory is rendered yet more complicated
by the uncertainty attaching to the authorship of particular treatises which have
been claimed for both. If, for instance, we could with certainty assign to S. Gregory that
treatise on the terms οὐσία and ὑπόστασις, which Dorner treats as one of the works by which
he “contributed materially to fix the uncertain usage of the Church38,” but which is found
also among the works of S. Basil in the form of a letter addressed to S. Gregory himself, we
should be able to estimate the nature and the extent of the influence of the Bishop of Nyssa
much more definitely than we can possibly do while the authorship of this treatise remains
uncertain. Nor does this document stand alone in this respect, although it is perhaps of
more importance for the determination of such a question than any other of the disputed
treatises. Thus in the absence of certainty as to the precise extent to which S. Gregory’s
teaching was directly indebted to that of his brother, it seems impossible to say how far the
“fixing of the uncertain usage of the Church” was due to either of them singly. That together
they did contribute very largely to that result is beyond question: and it is perhaps superfluous
to endeavour to separate their contributions, especially as there can be little doubt that S.
Gregory at least conceived himself to be in agreement with S. Basil upon all important points,
if not to be acting simply as the mouth-piece of his “master’s” teaching, and as the defender
of the statements which his “master” had set forth against possible misconceptions of their
meaning. Some points, indeed, there clearly were, in which S. Gregory’s presentment of the
doctrine differs from that of S. Basil; but to these it may be better to revert at a later stage,
after considering the more striking variation which their teaching displays from the language
of the earlier Nicene school as represented by S. Athanasius.</p>
<p>The council held at Alexandria in the year 362, during the brief restoration of S. Athanasius,
shows us at once the point of contrast and the substantial agreement between the
<note type="footnote">38 See Dorner, Doctrine of the Person of Christ, Div. I. vol. ii. p. 314 (English Trans.).</note>

<pb n="43"/>
Western school, with which S. Athanasius himself is in this matter to be reckoned, and the
Eastern theologians to whom has been given the title of “Neo-Nicene.” The question at issue
was one of language, not of belief; it turned upon the sense to be attached to the word
ὑπόστασις. The Easterns, following a use of the term which may be traced perhaps to the
influence of Origen, employed the word in the sense of the Latin “Persona,” and spoke of
the Three Persons as τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις, whereas the Latins employed the term “hypostasis”
as equivalent to “sub-stantia,” to express what the Greeks called οὐσία,—the one Godhead
of the Three Persons. With the Latins agreed the older school of the orthodox Greek theologians,
who applied to the Three Persons the phrase τρία πρόσωπα, speaking of the Godhead
as μία ὑπόστασις. This phrase, in the eyes of the newer Nicene school, was suspected of
Sabellianism39, while on the other hand the Westerns were inclined to regard the Eastern
phrase τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις as implying tritheism. The synodal letter sets forth to us the means
by which the fact of substantial agreement between the two schools was brought to light,
and the understanding arrived at, that while Arianism on the one hand and Sabellianism
on the other were to be condemned, it was advisable to be content with the language of the
Nicene formula, which employed neither the phrase μία ὑπόστασις nor the phrase τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις40. This resolution, prudent as it may have been for the purpose of bringing together
those who were in real agreement, and of securing that the reconciled parties should,
at a critical moment, present an unbroken front in the face of their common and still dangerous
enemy, could hardly be long maintained. The expression τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις was one
to which many of the orthodox, including those who had formerly belonged to the Semi-
Arian section, had become accustomed: the Alexandrine synod, under the guidance of S.
Athanasius, had acknowledged the phrase, as used by them, to be an orthodox one, and S.
Basil, in his efforts to conciliate the Semi-Arian party, with which he had himself been closely
connected through his namesake of Ancyra and through Eustathius of Sebastia, saw fit
definitely to adopt it. While S. Athanasius, on the one hand, using the older terminology,
says that ὑπόστασις is equivalent to οὐσία, and has no other meaning41, S. Basil, on the
other hand, goes so far as to say that the terms οὐσία and ὑπόστασις, even in the Nicene
anathema, are not to be understood as equivalent42. The adoption of the new phrase, even
after the explanations given at Alexandria, was found to require, in order to avoid miscon-
<note type="footnote">39 It is to be noted further that the use of the terms “Persona” and πρόσωπον by those who avoided the phrase
τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις no doubt assisted in the formation of this suspicion. At the same time the Nicene anathema
favoured the sense of ὑπόστασις as equivalent to οὐσία, and so appeared to condemn the Eastern use.</note>

struction, a more precise definition of its meaning, and a formal defence of its orthodoxy.
And herein consisted one principal service rendered by S. Basil and S. Gregory; while with
more precise definition of the term ὑπόστασις there emerged, it may be, a more precise view
of the relations of the Persons, and with the defence of the new phrase as expressive of the
Trinity of Persons a more precise view of what is implied in the Unity of the Godhead.</p>
<p>The treatise, De Sancta Trinitate is one of those which are attributed by some to S. Basil,
by others to S. Gregory: but for the purpose of showing the difficulties with which they had
to deal, the question of its exact authorship is unimportant. 43The most obvious objection
alleged against their teaching was that which had troubled the Western theologians before
the Alexandrine Council,—the objection that the acknowledgment of Three Persons implied
a belief in Three Gods. To meet this, there was required a statement of the meaning of the
term ὑπόστασις, and of the relation of ὀυσία to ὑπόστασις. Another objection, urged apparently
by the same party as the former, was directed against the “novelty,” or inconsistency,
of employing in the singular terms expressive of the Divine Nature such as “goodness” or
“Godhead,” while asserting that the Godhead exists in plurality of Persons44. To meet this,
it was required that the sense in which the Unity of the Godhead was maintained should be
more plainly and clearly defined.</p>
<p>The position taken by S. Basil with regard to the terms οὐσία and ὑπόστασις is very
concisely stated in his letter to Terentius45. He says that the Western theologians themselves
acknowledge that a distinction does exist between the two terms: and he briefly sets forth
his view of the nature of that distinction by saying that οὐσία is to ὑπόστασις as that which
is common to individuals is to that in respect of which the individuals are naturally differentiated.
He illustrates this statement by the remark that each individual man has his being
τῷ κοίνῳ τῆς οὐσίας λόγῳ, while he is differentiated as an individual man in virtue of his
own particular attributes. So in the Trinity that which constitutes the οὐσία (be it “goodness”
or be it “Godhead”) is common, while the ὑπόστασις is marked by the Personal attribute of
Fatherhood or Sonship or Sanctifying Power46. This position is also adopted and set forth
<note type="footnote">43 It appears on the whole more probable that the treatise is the work of S. Gregory; but it is found, in a slightly
different shape, among the Letters of S. Basil. (Ep. 189 in the Benedictine Edition.)</note>
<note type="footnote">44 In what sense this language was charged with “novelty” is not very clear. But the point of the objection
appears to lie in a refusal to recognize that terms expressive of the Divine Nature, whether they indicate attributes
or operations of that Nature, may be predicated of each ὑπόστασις severally, as well as of the οὐσία, without attaching
to the terms themselves that idea of plurality which, so far as they express attributes or operations of
the οὐσία, must be excluded from them.</note>

in greater detail in the treatise, De Diff. Essen. et Hypost.47, already referred to, where we
find once more the illustration employed in the Epistle to Terentius. The Nature of the
Father is beyond our comprehension; but whatever conception we are able to form of that
Nature, we must consider it to be common also to the Son and to the Holy Spirit: so far as
the οὐσία is concerned, whatever is predicated of any one of the Persons may be predicated
equally of each of the Three Persons, just as the properties of man, quâ man, belong alike
to Paul and Barnabas and Timothy: and as these individual men are differentiated by their
own particular attributes, so each Person of the Trinity is distinguished by a certain attribute
from the other two Persons. This way of putting the case naturally leads to the question, “If
you say, as you do say, that Paul and Barnabas and Timothy are ‘three men,’ why do you
not say that the Three Persons are ‘three Gods?’” Whether the question was presented in
this shape to S. Basil we cannot with certainty decide: but we may gather from his language
regarding the applicability of number to the Trinity what his answer would have been. He48
says that in acknowledging One Father, One Son, One Holy Spirit, we do not enumerate
them by computation, but assert the individuality, so to say, of each hypostasis—its distinctness
from the others. He would probably have replied by saying that strictly speaking we
ought to decline applying to the Deity, considered as Deity, any numerical idea at all, and
that to enumerate the Persons as “three” is a necessity, possibly, imposed upon us by language,
but that no conception of number is really applicable to the Divine Nature or to the Divine
Persons, which transcend number49. To S. Gregory, however, the question did actually
present itself as one demanding an answer, and his reply to it marks his departure from S.
Basil’s position, though, if the treatise, De Diff. Essen. et Hyp. be S. Basil’s, S. Gregory was
but following out and defending the view of his “master” as expressed in that treatise.</p>
<p>S. Gregory’s reply to the difficulty may be found in the letter, or short dissertation, addressed
to Ablabius (Quod non sunt tres Dei), and in his treatise περὶ κοινῶν ἐννοίων. In
the latter he lays it down that the term θεός is a term οὐσίας σημαντικόν, not a term
προσώπων δηλωτικόν: the Godhead of the Father is not that in which He maintains His
differentiation from the Son: the Son is not God because He is Son, but because His essential
Nature is what it is. Accordingly, when we speak of “God the Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost,” the word and is employed to conjoin the terms expressive of the Persons,
not the repeated term which is expressive of the Essence, and which therefore, while applied
<note type="footnote">as it will be seen, treats the question as to the differentiation of the Persons somewhat differently, and rests his
answer on a basis theologically more scientific.</note>

to each of the Three Persons, yet cannot properly be employed in the plural. That in the
case of three individual “men” the term expressive of essence is employed in the plural is
due, he says, to the fact that in this case there are circumstances which excuse or constrain
such a use of the term “man” while such circumstances do not affect the case of the Holy
Trinity. The individuals included under the term “man” vary alike in number and in identity,
and thus we are constrained to speak of “men” as more or fewer, and in a certain sense to
treat the essence as well as the persons numerically. In the Holy Trinity, on the other hand,
the Persons are always the same, and their number the same. Nor are the Persons of the
Holy Trinity differentiated, like individual men, by relations of time and place, and the like;
the differentiation between them is based upon a constant causal relation existing among
the Three Persons, which does not affect the unity of the Nature: it does not express the
Being, but the mode of Being50. The Father is the Cause; the Son and the Holy Spirit are
differentiated from Him as being from the Cause, and again differentiated inter se as being
immediately from the Cause, and immediately through that which is from the Cause. Further,
while these reasons may be alleged for holding that the cases are not in such a sense parallel
as to allow that the same conclusion as to modes of speech should be drawn in both, he
urges that the use of the term “men” in the plural is, strictly speaking, erroneous. We should,
in strictness, speak not of “this or that man,” but of “this or that hypostasis of man”—the
“three men” should be described as “three hypostases” of the common οὐσία “man.” In the
treatise addressed to Ablabius he goes over the same ground, clothing his arguments in a
somewhat less philosophical dress; but he devotes more space to an examination of the
meaning of the term θεός, with a view to showing that it is a term expressive of operation,
and thereby of essence, not a term which may be considered as applicable to any one of the
Divine Persons in any such peculiar sense that it may not equally be applied also to the
other two51. His argument is partly based upon an etymology now discredited, but this does
not affect the position he seeks to establish (a position which is also adopted in the treatise,
De S. Trinitate), that names expressive of the Divine Nature, or of the Divine operation (by
which alone that Nature is known to us) are employed, and ought to be employed, only in
the singular. The unity and inseparability of all Divine operation, proceeding from the
<note type="footnote">50 This statement strikes at the root of the theory held by Eunomius, as well as by the earlier Arians, that the
ἀγεννησία of the Father constituted His Essence. S. Gregory treats His ἀγεννησία as that by which He is distinguished
from the other Persons, as an attribute marking His hypostasis. This subject is treated more fully, with
special reference to the Eunomian view, in the Ref. alt. libri Eunomii.</note>
<note type="footnote">51 S. Gregory would apparently extend this argument even to the operations expressed by the names of “Redeemer,”
or “Comforter;” though he would admit that in regard of the mode by which these operations are applied
to man, the names expressive of them are used in a special sense of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, yet he would
argue that in neither case does the one Person act without the other two.</note>

<pb n="47"/>
Father, advancing through the Son, and culminating in the Holy Spirit, yet setting forth one
κίνησις of the Divine will, is the reason why the idea of plurality is not suffered to attach to
these names52, while the reason for refusing to allow, in regard to the three Divine Persons,
the same laxity of language which we tolerate in regard to the case of the three “men,” is to
be found in the fact that in the latter case no danger arises from the current abuse of language:
no one thinks of “three human natures;” but on the other hand polytheism is a very real
and serious danger, to which the parallel abuse of language involved in speaking of “three
Gods” would infallibly expose us.</p>
<p>S. Gregory’s own doctrine, indeed, has seemed to some critics to be open to the charge
of tritheism. But even if his doctrine were entirely expressed in the single illustration of
which we have spoken, it does not seem that the charge would hold good, when we consider
the light in which the illustration would present itself to him. The conception of the unity
of human nature is with him a thing intensely vivid: it underlies much of his system, and
he brings it prominently forward more than once in his more philosophical writings53. We
cannot, in fairness, leave his realism out of account when we are estimating the force of his
illustration: and therefore, while admitting that the illustration was one not unlikely to
produce misconceptions of his teaching, we may fairly acquit him of any personal bias towards
tritheism such as might appear to be involved in the unqualified adoption of the same
illustration by a writer of our own time, or such as might have been attributed to theologians
of the period of S. Gregory who adopted the illustration without the qualification of a realism
as determined as his own54. But the illustration does not stand alone: we must not consider
that it is the only one of those to be found in the treatise, De Diff. Essen. et Hypost., which
he would have felt justified in employing. Even if the illustration of the rainbow, set forth
in that treatise, was not actually his own (as Dorner, ascribing the treatise to him, considers
it to have been), it was at all events (on the other theory of the authorship), included in the
teaching he had received from his “master:” it would be present to his mind, although in
his undisputed writings, where he is dealing with objections brought against the particular
illustration from human relations, he naturally confines himself to the particular illustration
from which an erroneous inference was being drawn. In our estimate of his teaching the
one illustration must be allowed to some extent to qualify the effect produced by the other.
And, further, we must remember that his argument from human relations is professedly
only an illustration. It points to an analogy, to a resemblance, not to an identity of relations;
so much he is careful in his reply to state. Even if it were true, he implies, that we are war-
<note type="footnote">52 See Dorner, ut sup., pp. 317–18.</note>

<pb n="48"/>
ranted in speaking, in the given case, of the three human persons as “three men,” it would
not follow that we should be warranted thereby in speaking of the three Divine Persons as
“three Gods.” For the human personalities stand contrasted with the Divine, at once as regards
their being and as regards their operation. The various human πρόσωπα draw their
being from many other πρόσωπα, one from one, another from another, not, as the Divine,
from One, unchangeably the same: they operate, each in his own way, severally and independently,
not, as the Divine, inseparably: they are contemplated each by himself, in his
own limited sphere, κατ᾽ ἰδίαν περιγραφήν, not, as the Divine, in mutual essential connexion,
differentiated one from the other only by a certain mutual relation. And from this it follows
that the human πρόσωπα are capable of enumeration in a sense in which number cannot
be considered applicable to the Divine Persons. Here we find S. Gregory’s teaching brought
once more into harmony with his “master’s:” if he has been willing to carry the use of numerical
terms rather further than S. Basil was prepared to do, he yet is content in the last
resort to say that number is not in strictness applicable to the Divine ὑποστάσεις, in that
they cannot be contemplated κατ᾽ ἰδίαν περιγραφήν, and therefore cannot be enumerated
by way of addition. Still the distraction of the ὑποστάσεις remains; and if there is no other
way (as he seems to have considered there was none), of making full acknowledgment of
their distinct though inseparable existence than to speak of them as “three,” he holds that
that use of numerical language is justifiable, so long as we do not transfer the idea of number
from the ὑποστάσεις to the οὐσία, to that Nature of God which is Itself beyond our conception,
and which we can only express by terms suggested to us by what we know of Its operation.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the teaching of S. Gregory on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as expressed
in the treatises in which he developed and defended those positions in which S.
Basil appeared to diverge from the older Nicene theologians. That the terminology of the
subject gained clearness and definiteness from his exposition, in that he rendered it plain
that the adoption of the Eastern phraseology was a thing perfectly consistent with the Faith
confessed alike by East and West in varying terms, seems beyond doubt. It was to him,
probably, rather than to S. Basil, that this work was due; for he cleared up the points which
S. Basil’s illustration had left doubtful; yet in so doing he was using throughout the weapons
which his “master” had placed in his hands, and arguing in favour of his “master’s” statements,
in language, it may be, less guarded than S. Basil himself would have employed, but
in accordance throughout with the principles which S. Basil had followed. Each bore his
own part in the common work: to one, perhaps, is due the credit of greater originality; to
the other it was given to carry on and to extend what his brother had begun: neither, we
may well believe, would have desired to claim that the work which their joint teaching effected
should be imputed to himself alone.</p>

<pb n="49"/>
<p>So far, we have especially had in view those minor treatises of S. Gregory which illustrate
such variations from Athanasian modes of expression as are to be found in the writers of
the “Neo-Nicene” school. These are perhaps his most characteristic works upon the subject.
But the doctrine of the Trinity, as he held it, is further set forth and enforced in other
treatises which are, from another point of view, much more important than those with
which we have been dealing—in his Oratio Catechetica, and his more directly polemical
treatises against Eunomius. In both these sections of his writings, when allowance is made
for the difference of terminology already discussed, we are less struck by the divergencies
from S. Athanasius’ presentment of the doctrine than by the substantial identity of S.
Gregory’s reasoning with that of S. Athanasius, as the latter is displayed, for example, in the
“Orations against the Arians.”</p>
<p>There are, of course, many points in which S. Gregory falls short of his great predecessor;
but of these some may perhaps be accounted for by the different aspect of the Arian controversy
as it presented itself to the two champions of the Faith. The later school of Arianism
may indeed be regarded as a perfectly legitimate and rigidly logical development of the
doctrines taught by Arius himself; but in some ways the task of S. Gregory was a different
task from that of S. Athanasius, and was the less formidable of the two. His antagonist was,
by his own greater definiteness of statement, placed at a disadvantage: the consequences
which S. Athanasius had to extract from the Arian statements were by Eunomius and the
Anomoeans either openly asserted or tacitly admitted: and it was thus an easier matter for
S. Gregory to show the real tendency of Anomoean doctrine than it had been for S. Athanasius
to point out the real tendency of the earlier Arianism. Further, it may be said that by the
time of S. Basil, still more by the time when S. Gregory succeeded to his brother’s place in
the controversy, the victory over Arianism was assured. It was not possible for S. Athanasius,
even had it been in his nature to do so, to treat the earlier Arianism with the same sort of
contemptuous criticism with which Eunomius is frequently met by S. Gregory. For S.
Gregory, on the other hand, it was not necessary to refrain from such criticism lest he should
thereby detract from the force of his protest against error. The crisis in his day was not one
which demanded the same sustained effort for which the contest called in the days of S.
Athanasius. Now and then, certainly, S. Gregory also rises to a white heat of indignation
against his adversary: but it is hardly too much to say that his work appears to lack just those
qualities which seem, in the writings of S. Athanasius, to have been called forth by the author’s
sense of the weight of the force opposed to him, and of the “life and death” character of the
contest. S. Gregory does not under-estimate the momentous nature of the questions at issue:
but when he wrote, he might feel that to those questions the answer of Christendom had
been already given, that the conflict was already won, and that any attempt at developing
the Arian doctrine on Anomoean lines was the adoption of an untenable position,—even
of a position manifestly and evidently untenable: the doctrine had but to be stated in clear

<pb n="50"/>
terms to be recognized as incompatible with Christianity, and, that fact once recognized,
he had no more to do. Thus much of his treatises against Eunomius consists not of constructive
argument in support of his own position, but of a detailed examination of Eunomius’
own statements, while a further portion of the contents of these books, by no means inconsiderable
in amount, is devoted not so much to the defence of the Faith as to the refutation
of certain misrepresentations of S. Basil’s arguments which had been set forth by Eunomius.</p>
<p>Even in the more distinctly constructive portion of these polemical writings, however,
it may be said that S. Gregory does not show marked originality of thought either in his
general argument, or in his mode of handling disputed texts. Within the limits of an introductory
essay like the present, anything like detailed comparison on these points is of course
impossible; but any one who will take the trouble to compare the discourses of S. Gregory
against Eunomius with the “Orations” of S. Athanasius against the Arians,—the Athanasian
writing, perhaps, most closely corresponding in character to these books of S.
Gregory,—either as regards the specific passages of Scripture cited in support of the doctrine
maintained, and the mode of interpreting them, or as to the methods of explanation applied
to the texts alleged by the Arian writers in favour of their own opinions, can hardly fail to
be struck by the number and the closeness of the resemblances which he will be able to trace
between the earlier and the later representatives of the Nicene School. A somewhat similar
relation to the Athanasian position, as regards the basis of belief, and (allowing for the difference
of terminology) as regards the definition of doctrine, may be observed in the Oratio
Catechetica.</p>
<p>Such originality, in fact, as S. Gregory may claim to possess (so far as his treatment of
this subject is concerned) is rather the originality of the tactician than that of the strategist:
he deals rather with his particular opponent, and keeps in view the particular point in discussion
more than the general area over which the war extends. S. Athanasius, on the other
hand (partly, no doubt, because he was dealing with a less fully developed form of error),
seems to have more force left in reserve. He presents his arguments in a more concise form,
and is sometimes content to suggest an inference where S. Gregory proceeds to draw out
conclusions in detail, and where thereby the latter, while possibly strengthening his presentment
of the truth as against his own particular adversary,—against the Anomoean or the
polytheist on the one side, or against the Sabellian or the Judaizer on the other,—renders
his argument, when considered per se as a defence of the orthodox position, frequently more
diffuse and sometimes less forcible. Yet, even here, originality of a certain kind does belong
to S. Gregory, and it seems only fair to him to say that in these treatises also he did good
service in defence of the Faith touching the Holy Trinity. He shows that alike by way of
formal statement of doctrine, as in the Oratio Catechetica, and by way of polemical argument,
the forces at the command of the defenders of the Faith could be organized to meet varied
forms of error, without abandoning, either for a more original theology like that or Marcellus

<pb n="51"/>
of Ancyra, or for the compromise which the Homoean or Semi-Arian school were in danger
of being led to accept, the weapons with which S. Athanasius had conquered at Nicæa.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Mss. And Editions.</head>
<p>For the 13 Books Against Eunomius, the text of F. Oehler (S. Greg. Nyss. Opera. Tom.
I. Halis, 1865) has in the following translations been almost entirely followed.</p>
<p>The 1st Book was not in the 1st Paris Edition in two volumes (1615); but it was published
three years afterwards from the ‘Bavarian Codex,’ i.e. that of Munich, by J. Gretser in an
Appendix, along with the Summaries (these headings of the sections of the entire work are
by some admirer of Gregory’s) and the two introductory Letters. Both the Summaries and
the letters, and also nearly three-quarters of the 1st Book were obtained from J. Livineius’
transcript of the Vatican ms. made at Rome, 1579. This Appendix was added to the 2nd
Paris Edition, in three volumes (1638).</p>
<p>In correcting these Paris Editions (for mss. of which see below), Oehler had access, in
addition to the identical Munich ms. (paper, 16th century) which Gretser had used, to the
following mss.:—
<lg>
<l>1. Venice (Library of S. Mark; cotton, 13 Cent., No. 69). This he says ‘wonderfully</l>
<l>agrees’ with the Munich (both, for instance, supply the lacunæ of the Paris</l>
<l>Edition of Book I: he concludes, therefore, that these are not due to Gretser’s</l>
<l>negligence, who gives the Latin for these passages, but to that of the printers).</l>
<l>2. Turin (Royal Library; cotton, 14 Cent., No. 71).</l>
<l>3. Milan (Library of S. Ambrose; cotton, 13 Cent., No. 225, Plut. 1; its inscription</l>
<l>says that it was brought from Thessaly).</l>
<l>4. Florence (Library Medic. Laurent.; the oldest of all; parchment, 11 Cent., No. 17,</l>
<l>Plut. vi. It contains the Summaries).</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>These, and the Munich ms., which he chiefly used, are “all of the same family:” and from
them he has been able to supply more than 50 lacunæ in the Books against Eunomius. This
family is the first of the two separated by G. H. Forbes (see below). The Munich ms. (No.
47, on paper, 16 Cent.), already used by Sifanus for his Latin version (1562), and by Gretser
for his Appendix, has the corrections of the former in its margin. These passed into the two
Paris Editions; which, however, took no notice of his critical notes. When lent to Sifanus
this ms. was in the Library of J. J. Fugger. Albert V. Duke of Bavaria purchased the treasures
of Greek literature in this library, to found that in Munich.</p>
<p>For the treatise On the Soul and the Resurrection, the Great Catechetical Oration, and
the Funeral Oration on Meletius, John George Krabinger’s text has been adopted. He had
mss. ‘old and of a better stamp’ (Oehler) than were accessible to the Paris editors. Krabinger’s
own account of them is this:—</p>

<pb n="53"/>
<p>On the Soul. 5 mss. of 16th, 14th, and 11th Cent. All at Munich. In one of them there
are scholia, some imported into the text by J. Naupliensis Murmureus the copyist; and Sifanus’
corrections.</p>
<p>The ‘Hasselman,’ 14th Cent. J. Christopher Wolf, who annotated this treatise (Aneedota
Græca, Hamburgh, 1722), says of this ms. “very carefully written.” It was lent by Zach.
Hasselman, Minister of Oldenburgh.</p>
<p>The ‘Uffenbach,’ 14th Cent., with var. lect. in margin. Lent to Wolf by the Polish ambassador
at Frankfort on Main, at the request of Zach. Uffenbach.</p>
<p>Catechetical Oration. 4 mss. of 16th Cent., 1 of 13th Cent., ‘much mutilated.’ All at Munich.</p>
<p>On Meletius. 2 mss. of 16th Cent., 1 of 10th Cent. All at Munich.</p>
<p>His edition of the former appeared, at Leipzic, 1837; of the two latter, at Munich, 1838;
all with valuable notes.</p>
<p>For the treatise Against Macedonius, the only text available is that of Cardinal Angelo
Mai (Script. Vet. Nova Collectio, Rome, 1833). It is taken from the Vatican ms. ‘on silk.’
The end of this treatise is not found in Mai. Perhaps it is in the ms. of Florence.</p>
<p>For fourteen of the Letters, Zacagni (Præfect of the Vatican Library, 1698–1713) is the
only editor. His text from the Vatican ms., No. 424, is printed in his Collectan. Monument.
ret. (pp. 354–400), Rome, 1698.</p>
<p>He had not the use of the Medicean ms. which Caraccioli (see below) testifies to be
much superior to the Vatican; there are lacunæ in the latter, however, which Zacagni occasionally
fills by a happy guess with the very words supplied by the Medicean.</p>
<p>For the Letter to Adelphius, and that (on Church Architecture) to Amphilochius, J. B.
Caraccioli (Professor of Philosophy at Pisa) furnishes a text (Florence, 1731) from the
Medicean ms. The Letters in this collection are seven in all. Of the last of these (including
that to Amphilochius) Bandinus says non sincerâ fide ex Codice descriptas, and that a fresh
collation is necessary.</p>
<p>For the treatise On the Making of Man, the text employed has been that of G. H. Forbes,
(his first Fasciculus was published in 1855; his second in 1861; both at Burntisland, at his
private press), with an occasional preference for the readings of one or other of the mss.
examined by him or by others on his behalf. Of these he specifies twenty: but he had examined
a much larger number. The mss. which contain this work, he considers, are of two families.</p>
<p>Of the first family the most important are three mss. at Vienna, a tenth-century ms. on
vellum at S. Mark’s, Venice, which he himself collated, and a Vatican ms. of the tenth century.
This family also includes three of the four Munich mss. collated for Forbes by Krabinger.</p>
<p>The other family displays more variations from the current text. One Vienna ms. “pervetustus”
“initio mutilus,” was completely collated. Also belonging to this family are the

<pb n="54"/>
oldest of the four Munich mss., the tenth-century Codex Regius (Paris), and a fourteenthcentury
ms. at Christ Church, Oxford, clearly related to the last.</p>
<p>The Codex Baroccianus (Bodleian, perhaps eleventh century) appears to occupy an independent
position.</p>
<p>For the other Treatises and Letters the text of the Paris Edition of 1638 (‘plenior et
emendatior’ than that of 1615, according to Oehler, probably following its own title, but
“much inferior to that of 1615” Canon Venables, Dict. Christ. Biog., says, and this is the
judgment of J. Fessler) and of Migne have been necessary as the latest complete editions of
the works of Gregory Nyssene. (All the materials that had been collected for the edition of
the Benedictines of St. Maur perished in the French Revolution.)</p>
<p>Of the two Paris Editions it must be confessed that they are based ‘for the most part on
inferior mss.’ (Oehler.) The frequent lacunæ attest this. Fronto Ducæus aided Claude, the
brother of F. Morel, in settling the text, and the mss. mentioned in the notes of the former
are as follows:
<lg>
<l>1. Pithoeus’ “not of a very ancient hand,” “as like F. Morel’s (No. 2.) as milk to milk”</l>
<l>(so speaks John the Franciscan, who emended ‘from one corrupt mutilated manuscript,’</l>
<l>i.e. the above, the Latin translation of the Books against Eunomius</l>
<l>made by his father N. Gulonius.)</l>
<l>2. F. Morel’s. (“Dean of Professors” and Royal Printer.)</l>
<l>3. The Royal (in the Library of Henry II., Paris), on vellum, tenth century.</l>
<l>4. Canter’s (“ingens codex” sent from Antwerp by A. Schott; it had been written out</l>
<l>for T. Canter, Senator of Utrecht).</l>
<l>5. Olivar’s. “Multo emendatius” than (2.)</l>
<l>6. J. Vulcobius’, Abbot of Belpré.</l>
<l>7. The Vatican. For the treatise On Virginity. (The Paris Editors used Livineius’</l>
<l>Edition, based on (7) and (8).</l>
<l>8. Bricman’s (Cologne). For the treatise On Virginity. (The Paris Editors used Livineius’</l>
<l>Edition, based on (7) and (8).</l>
<l>9. OEgidius David’s, I.C. Paris. For the treatise On Virginity. (The Paris Editors used</l>
<l>Livineius’ Edition, based on (7) and (8).</l>
<l>10. The Bavarian (Munich) for Books II.–XIII. Against Eunomius and other treatises;</l>

<p>Other important mss. existing for treatises here translated are</p>

is still true that ‘the text of hardly any other ancient writer is in a more imperfect state

<p>Gregory to his brother Peter, Bishop of Sebasteia.</p>
<p>Having with difficulty obtained a little leisure, I have been able to recover from bodily
fatigue on my return from Armenia, and to collect the sheets of my reply to Eunomius which
was suggested by your wise advice; so that my work is now arranged in a complete treatise,
which can be read between covers. However, I have not written against both his pamphlets55;
even the leisure for that was not granted; for the person who lent me the heretical volume
most uncourteously sent for it again, and allowed me no time either to write it out or to
study it. In the short space of seventeen days it was impossible to be prepared to answer
both his attacks.</p>
<p>Owing to its somehow having become notorious that we had laboured to answer this
blasphemous manifesto, many persons possessing some zeal for the Truth have importuned
me about it: but I have thought it right to prefer you in your wisdom before them all, to
advise me whether to consign this work to the public, or to take some other course. The
reason why I hesitate is this. When our saintly Basil fell asleep, and I received the legacy of
Eunomius’ controversy, when my heart was hot within me with bereavement, and, besides
this deep sorrow for the common loss of the church, Eunomius had not confined himself
to the various topics which might pass as a defence of his views, but had spent the chief part
of his energy in laboriously-written abuse of our father in God. I was exasperated with this,
and there were passages where the flame of my heart-felt indignation burst out against this
writer. The public have pardoned us for much else, because we have been apt in showing
patience in meeting lawless attacks, and as far as possible have practised that restraint in
feeling which the saint has taught us; but I had fears lest from what we have now written
against this opponent the reader should get the idea that we were very raw controversialists,
<note type="footnote">55 both his pamphlets. The ‘sheets’ which Gregory says that he has collected are the 12 Books that follow. They
are written in reply to Eunomius’ pamphlet, ‘Apologia Apologiæ,’ itself a reply to Basil’s Refutation. The other
pamphlet of Eunomius seems to have come out during the composition of Gregory’s 12 Books: and was afterwards
answered by the latter in a second 12th Book, but not now, because of the shortness of the time in which he had
a copy of the ‘heretical volume’ in his hands. The two last books of the five which go under the title of Basil’s
Refutation are considered on good grounds to have been Gregory’s, and to have formed that short reply to Eunomius
which he read, at the Council of Constantinople, to Gregory of Nazianzen and Jerome (d. vir. illust. c.
128). Then he worked upon this longer reply. Thus there were in all three works of Gregory corresponding to
the three attacks of Eunomius upon the Trinity.</note>

who lost our temper directly at insolent abuse. Perhaps, however, this suspicion about us
will be disarmed by remembering that this display of anger is not on our own behalf, but
because of insults levelled against our father in God; and that it is a case in which mildness
would be more unpardonable than anger.</p>
<p>If, then, the first part of my treatise should seem somewhat outside the controversy, the
following explanation of it will, I think, be accepted by a reader who can judge fairly. It was
not right to leave undefended the reputation of our noble saint, mangled as it was by the
opponent’s blasphemies, any more than it was convenient to let this battle in his behalf be
spread diffusely along the whole thread of the discussion; besides, if any one reflects, these
pages do really form part of the controversy. Our adversary’s treatise has two separate arms,
viz. to abuse us and to controvert sound doctrine; and therefore ours too must show a double
front. But for the sake of clearness, and in order that the thread of the discussion upon
matters of the Faith should not be cut by parentheses, consisting of answers to their personal
abuse, we have separated our work into two parts, and devoted ourselves in the first to refute
these charges: and then we have grappled as best we might with that which they have advanced
against the Faith. Our treatise also contains, in addition to a refutation of their
heretical views, a dogmatic exposition of our own teaching; for it would be a most shameful
want of spirit, when our foes make no concealment of their blasphemy, not to be bold in
our statement of the Truth.</p>

<head>Letter II.</head>
<p>To his most pious brother Gregory. Peter greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>Having met with the writings of your holiness and having perceived in your tract against
this heresy your zeal both for the truth and for our sainted father in God, I judge that this
work was not due simply to your own ability, but was that of one who studied that the Truth
should speak, even in the publication of his own views. To the Holy Spirit of truth I would
refer this plea for the truth; just as to the father of lies, and not to Eunomius, should be referred
this animosity against sound faith. Indeed, that murderer from the beginning who
speaks in Eunomius has carefully whetted the sword against himself; for if he had not been
so bold against the truth, no one would have roused you to undertake the cause of our religion.
But to the end that the rottenness and flimsiness of their doctrines may be exposed,
He who “taketh the wise in their own craftiness” hath allowed them both to be headstrong
against the truth, and to have laboured vainly on this vain speech.</p>
<p>But since he that hath begun a good work will finish it, faint not in furthering the Spirit’s
power, nor leave half-won the victory over the assailants of Christ’s glory; but imitate thy
true father who, like the zealot Phineas, pierced with one stroke of his Answer both master
and pupil. Plunge with thy intellectual arm the sword of the Spirit through both these
heretical pamphlets, lest, though broken on the head, the serpent affright the simpler sort
by still quivering in the tail. When the first arguments have been answered, should the last
remain unnoticed, the many will suspect that they still retain some strength against the
truth.</p>
<p>The feeling shewn in your treatise will be grateful, as salt, to the palate of the soul. As
bread cannot be eaten, according to Job, without salt, so the discourse which is not savoured
with the inmost sentiments of God’s word will never wake, and never move, desire.</p>
<p>Be strong, then, in the thought that thou art a beautiful example to succeeding times of
the way in which good-hearted children should act towards their virtuous fathers.</p>

<head>§1. Preface.—It is useless to attempt to benefit those who will not accept help.</head>
<p>It seems that the wish to benefit all, and to lavish indiscriminately upon the first comer
one’s own gifts, was not a thing altogether commendable, or even free from reproach in the
eyes of the many; seeing that the gratuitous waste of many prepared drugs on the incurablydiseased
produces no result worth caring about, either in the way of gain to the recipient,
or reputation to the would-be benefactor. Rather such an attempt becomes in many cases
the occasion of a change for the worse. The hopelessly-diseased and now dying patient receives
only a speedier end from the more active medicines; the fierce unreasonable temper
is only made worse by the kindness of the lavished pearls, as the Gospel tells us. I think it
best, therefore, in accordance with the Divine command, for any one to separate the valuable
from the worthless when either have to be given away, and to avoid the pain which a generous
giver must receive from one who ‘treads upon his pearl,’ and insults him by his utter want
of feeling for its beauty.</p>
<p>This thought suggests itself when I think of one who freely communicated to others the
beauties of his own soul, I mean that man of God, that mouth of piety, Basil; one who from
the abundance of his spiritual treasures poured his grace of wisdom into evil souls whom
he had never tested, and into one among them, Eunomius, who was perfectly insensible to
all the efforts made for his good. Pitiable indeed seemed the condition of this poor man,
from the extreme weakness of his soul in the matter of the Faith, to all true members of the
Church; for who is so wanting in feeling as not to pity, at least, a perishing soul? But Basil
alone, from the abiding57 ardour of his love, was moved to undertake his cure, and therein
to attempt impossibilities; he alone took so much to heart the man’s desperate condition,
<note type="footnote">56 This first Book against Eunomius was not in the 1st Paris Edition of Gregory’s works, 1615; but it was
published three years later from the ‘Bavarian Codex,’ i.e. that of Munich, by J. Gretser, in an Appendix, along
with the Summaries (i.e. the headings of the sections, which appear to be not Gregory’s) and the two Introductory
Letters. These Summaries and the Letters, and nearly three quarters of the 1st Book were found in J. Livineius’
transcript from the Codex Vaticanus made 1579, at Rome. This Appendix was added to the 2nd Paris Edit. 1638.
F. Oehler, whose text has been followed throughout, has used for the 1st Book the Munich Codex (on paper,

as to compose, as an antidote of deadly poisons, his refutation of this heresy58, which aimed
at saving its author, and restoring him to the Church.</p>
<p>He, on the contrary, like one beside himself with fury, resists his doctor; he fights and
struggles; he regards as a bitter foe one who only put forth his strength to drag him from
the abyss of misbelief; and he does not indulge in this foolish anger only before chance
hearers now and then; he has raised against himself a literary monument to record this
blackness of his bile; and when in long years he got the requisite amount of leisure, he was
travailling over his work during all that interval with mightier pangs than those of the largest
and the bulkiest beasts; his threats of what was coming were dreadful, whilst he was still
secretly moulding his conception: but when at last and with great difficulty he brought it to
the light, it was a poor little abortion, quite prematurely born. However, those who share
his ruin nurse it and coddle it; while we, seeking the blessing in the prophet (“Blessed shall
he be who shall take thy children, and shall dash them against the stones59”) are only eager,
now that it has got into our hands, to take this puling manifesto and dash it on the rock, as
if it was one of the children of Babylon; and the rock must be Christ; in other words, the
enunciation of the truth. Only may that power come upon us which strengthens weakness,
through the prayers of him who made his own strength perfect in bodily weakness60.</p>
<note type="footnote">58 his refutation of this heresy. This is Basil’s ᾽Ανατρεπτικὸς τοῦ ἀπολογητικοῦ τοῦ δυοσεβοῦς Εὐνομίου.
‘Basil,’ says Photius, ‘with difficulty got hold of Eunomius’ book,’ perhaps because it was written originally for
a small circle of readers, and was in a highly scientific form. What happened next may be told in the words of
Claudius Morellius (Prolegomena to Paris Edition of 1615): ‘When Basil’s first essay against the foetus of Eunomius
had been published, he raised his bruised head like a trodden worm, seized his pen, and began to rave
more poisonously still as well against Basil as the orthodox faith.’ This was Eunomius’ ‘Apologia Apologiæ:’ of
it Photius says, ‘His reply to Basil was composed for many Olympiads while shut up in his cell. This, like another
Saturn, he concealed from the eyes of Basil till it had grown up, i.e. he concealed it, by devouring it, as long as
Basil lived.’ He then goes on to say that after Basil’s death, Theodore (of Mopsuestia), Gregory of Nyssa, and
Sophronius found it and dealt with it, though even then Eunomius had only ventured to show it to some of his
friends. Philostorgius, the ardent admirer of Eunomius, makes the amazing statement that Basil died of despair
after reading it.</note>

<head>§2. We have been justly provoked to make this Answer, being stung by Eunomius’ accusations
of our brother.</head>
<p>If indeed that godlike and saintly soul were still in the flesh looking out upon human
affairs, if those lofty tones were still heard with all their peculiar61 grace and all their resistless
utterance, who could arrive at such a pitch of audacity, as to attempt to speak one word
upon this subject? that divine trumpet-voice would drown any word that could be uttered.
But all of him has now flown back to God; at first indeed in the slight shadowy phantom of
his body, he still rested on the earth; but now he has quite shed even that unsubstantial form,
and bequeathed it to this world. Meantime the drones are buzzing round the cells of the
Word, and are plundering the honey; so let no one accuse me of mere audacity for rising
up to speak instead of those silent lips. I have not accepted this laborious task from any
consciousness in myself of powers of argument superior to the others who might be named;
I, if any, have the means of knowing that there are thousands in the Church who are strong
in the gift of philosophic skill. Nevertheless I affirm that, both by the written and the natural
law, to me more especially belongs this heritage of the departed, and therefore I myself, in
preference to others, appropriate the legacy of the controversy. I may be counted amongst
the least of those who are enlisted in the Church of God, but still I am not too weak to stand
out as her champion against one who has broken with that Church. The very smallest
member of a vigorous body would, by virtue of the unity of its life with the whole, be found
stronger than one that had been cut away and was dying, however large the latter and small
the former.</p>

<head>§3. We see nothing remarkable in logical force in the treatise of Eunomius, and so embark on
our Answer with a just confidence.</head>
<p>Let no one think, that in saying this I exaggerate and make an idle boast of doing
something which is beyond my strength. I shall not be led by any boyish ambition to descend
to his vulgar level in a contest of mere arguments and phrases. Where victory is a useless
and profitless thing, we yield it readily to those who wish to win; besides, we have only to
look at this man’s long practice in controversy, to conclude that he is quite a word-practitioner,
and, in addition, at the fact that he has spent no small portion of his life on the
composition of this treatise, and at the supreme joy of his intimates over these labours, to
conclude that he has taken particular trouble with this work. It was not improbable that one
who had laboured at it for so many Olympiads would produce something better than the
work of extempore scribblers. Even the vulgar profusion of the figures he uses in concocting
his work is a further indication of this laborious care in writing62. He has got a great mass
of newly assorted terms, for which he has put certain other books under contribution, and
he piles this immense congeries of words on a very slender nucleus of thought; and so he
has elaborated this highly-wrought production, which his pupils in error are lost in the admiration
of;—no doubt, because their deadness on the vital points deprives them of the
power of feeling the distinction between beauty and the reverse:—but which is ridiculous,
and of no value at all in the judgment of those, whose hearts’ insight is not dimmed with
any soil of unbelief. How in the world can it contribute to the proof (as he hopes) of what
he says and the establishment of the truth of his speculations, to adopt these absurd devices
in his forms of speech, this new-fangled and peculiar arrangement, this fussy conceit, and
this conceited fussiness, which works with no enthusiasm for any previous model? For it
would be indeed difficult to discover who amongst all those who have been celebrated for
their eloquence he has had his eye on, in bringing himself to this pitch; for he is like those
<note type="footnote">62 Photius reports very much the same as to his style, i.e. he shows a ‘prodigious ostentation:’ uses ‘words
difficult to pronounce, and abounding in many consonants, and that in a poetic, or rather a dithyrambic style:’
he has ‘periods inordinately long:’ he is ‘obscure,’ and seeks ‘to hide by this very obscurity whatever is weak in
his perceptions and conceptions, which indeed is often.’ He ‘attacks others for their logic, and is very fond of
using logic himself:’ but ‘as he had taken up this science late in life, and had not gone very deeply into it, he is
often found making mistakes.’ The book of Eunomius which Photius had read is still extant: it is his ‘Apologeticus’
in 28 sections, and has been published by Canisius (Lectiones Antiquæ, I. 172 ff.). His ἔκθεοις τῆς τίστεως,
presented to the emperor Theodosius in the year 383, is also extant. This last is found in the Codex Theodosius
and in the mss. which Livineius of Ghent used for his Greek and Latin edition of Gregory, 1574: it follows the
Books against Eunomius. His ‘Apologia Apologiæ,’ which he wrote in answer to Basil’s 5 (or 3) books against
him, is not extant: nor the δευτερὸς λόγος which Gregory answered in his second 12th Book. Most of the quotations,
then, from Eunomius, in these books of Gregory cannot be verified, in the case of a doubtful reading, U+0026c. </note>

who produce effects upon the stage, adapting his argument to the tune of his rhythmical
phrases, as they their song to their castenets, by means of parallel sentences of equal length,
of similar sound and similar ending. Such, amongst many other faults, are the nerveless
quaverings and the meretricious tricks of his Introduction; and one might fancy him
bringing them all out, not with an unimpassioned action, but with stamping of the feet and
sharp snapping of the fingers declaiming to the time thus beaten, and then remarking that
there was no need of other arguments and a second performance after that.</p>

<head>§4. Eunomius displays much folly and fine writing, but very little seriousness about vital points.</head>
<p>In these and such like antics I allow him to have the advantage; and to his heart’s content
he may revel in his victory there. Most willingly I forego such a competition, which can attract
those only who seek renown; if indeed any renown comes from indulging in such methods
of argumentation, considering that Paul63, that genuine minister of the Word, whose only
ornament was truth, both disdained himself to lower his style to such prettinesses, and instructs
us also, in a noble and appropriate exhortation, to fix our attention on truth alone.
What need indeed for one who is fair in the beauty of truth to drag in the paraphernalia of
a decorator for the production of a false artificial beauty? Perhaps for those who do not
possess truth it may be an advantage to varnish their falsehoods with an attractive style, and
to rub into the grain of their argument a curious polish. When their error is taught in farfetched
language and decked out with all the affectations of style, they have a chance of being
plausible and accepted by their hearers. But those whose only aim is simple truth, unadulterated
by any misguiding foil, find the light of a natural beauty emitted from their words.</p>
<p>But now that I am about to begin the examination of all that he has advanced, I feel the
same difficulty as a farmer does, when the air is calm; I know not how to separate his wheat
from his chaff; the waste, in fact, and the chaff in this pile of words is so enormous, that it
makes one think that the residue of facts and real thoughts in all that he has said is almost
nil. It would be the worse for speed and very irksome, it would even be beside our object,
to go into the whole of his remarks in detail; we have not the means for securing so much
leisure so as wantonly to devote it to such frivolities; it is the duty, I think, of a prudent
workman not to waste his strength on trifles, but on that which will clearly repay his toil.</p>
<p>As to all the things, then, in his Introduction, how he constitutes himself truth’s champion,
and fixes the charge of unbelief upon his opponents, and declares that an abiding and
indelible hatred for them has sunk into his soul, how he struts in his ‘new discoveries,’
though he does not tell us what they are, but says only that an examination of the debateable
points in them was set on foot, a certain ‘legal’ trial which placed on those who were daring
to act illegally the necessity of keeping quiet, or to quote his own words in that Lydian style
of singing which he has got, “the bold law-breakers—in open courts—were forced to be
quiet;” (he calls this a “proscription” of the conspiracy against him, whatever may be meant
by that term);—all this wearisome business I pass by as quite unimportant. On the other
hand, all his special pleading for his heretical conceits may well demand our close attention.
Our own interpreter of the principles of divinity followed this course in his Treatise; for
though he had plenty of ability to broaden out his argument, he took the line of dealing only
<note type="footnote">63 Cf. 1 Corinth. ii. 1–8.</note>

<pb n="66"/>
with vital points, which he selected from all the blasphemies of that heretical book64, and
so narrowed the scope of the subject.</p>
<p>If, however, any one desires that our answer should exactly correspond to the array of
his arguments, let him tell us the utility of such a process. What gain would it be to my
readers if I were to solve the complicated riddle of his title, which he proposes to us at the
very commencement, in the manner of the sphinx of the tragic stage; namely this ‘New
Apology for the Apology,’ and all the nonsense which he writes about that; and if I were to
tell the long tale of what he dreamt? I think that the reader is sufficiently wearied with the
petty vanity about this newness in his title already preserved in Eunomius’ own text, and
with the want of taste displayed there in the account of his own exploits, all his labours and
his trials, while he wandered over every land and every sea, and was ‘heralded’ through the
whole world. If all that had to be written down over again,—and with additions, too, as the
refutations of these falsehoods would naturally have to expand their statement,—who would
be found of such an iron hardness as not to be sickened at this waste of labour? Suppose I
was to write down, taking word by word, an explanation of that mad story of his; suppose
I were to explain, for instance, who that Armenian was on the shores of the Euxine, who
had annoyed him at first by having the same name as himself, what their lives were like,
what their pursuits, how he had a quarrel with that Armenian because of the very likeness
of their characters, then in what fashion those two were reconciled, so as to join in a common
sympathy with that winning and most glorious Aetius, his master (for so pompous are his
praises); and after that, what was the plot devised against himself, by which they brought
him to trial on the charge of being surpassingly popular: suppose, I say, I was to explain all
that, should I not appear, like those who catch opthalmia themselves from frequent contact
with those who are already suffering so, to have caught myself this malady of fussy circumstantiality?
I should be following step by step each detail of his twaddling story; finding out
who the “slaves released to liberty” were, what was “the conspiracy65 of the initiated” and
“the calling out66 of hired slaves,” what ‘Montius and Gallus, and Domitian,’ and ‘false
witnesses,’ and ‘an enraged Emperor,’ and ‘certain sent into exile’ have to do with the argument.
What could be more useless than such tales for the purpose of one who was not
wishing merely to write a narrative, but to refute the argument of him who had written
against his heresy? What follows in the story is still more profitless; I do not think that the
author himself could peruse it again without yawning, though a strong natural affection for

them, and not to soil this book by forcing my subject through all his written reminiscences,
like one who urges his horse through a slough and so gets covered with its filth, I think it is
best to leap over the mass of his rubbish with as high and as speedy a jump as my thoughts
are capable of, seeing that a quick retreat from what is disgusting is a considerable advantage;
and let us hasten on67 to the finale of his story, lest the bitterness of his own words should
trickle into my book. Let Eunomius have the monopoly of the bad taste in such words as
these, spoken of God’s priests68, “curmudgeon squires, and beadles, and satellites, rummaging
about, and not suffering the fugitive to carry on his concealment,” and all the other things
which he is not ashamed to write of grey-haired priests. Just as in the schools for secular
learning69, in order to exercise the boys to be ready in word and wit, they propose themes
for declamation, in which the person who is the subject of them is nameless, so does Eunomius
make an onset at once upon the facts suggested, and lets loose the tongue of invective,
and without saying one word as to any actual villainies, he merely works up against them
all the hackneyed phrases of contempt, and every imaginable term of abuse: in which, besides,
incongruous ideas are brought together, such as a ‘dilettante soldier,’ ‘an accursed saint,’
‘pale with fast, and murderous with hate,’ and many such like scurrilities; and just like a
reveller in the secular processions shouts his ribaldry, when he would carry his insolence
to the highest pitch, without his mask on, so does Eunomius, without an attempt to veil his
malignity, shout with brazen throat the language of the waggon. Then he reveals the cause
why he is so enraged; ‘these priests took every precaution that many should not’ be perverted
to the error of these heretics; accordingly he is angry that they could not stay at their convenience
in the places they liked, but that a residence was assigned them by order of the
then governor of Phrygia, so that most might be secured from such wicked neighbours; his
indignation at this bursts out in these words; ‘the excessive severity of our trials,’ ‘our
grievous sufferings,’ ‘our noble endurance of them,’ ‘the exile from our native country into

Phrygia.’ Quite so: this Oltiserian70 might well be proud of what occurred, putting an end
as it did to all his family pride, and casting such a slur upon his race that that far-renowned
Priscus, his grandfather, from whom he gets those brilliant and most remarkable heirlooms,
“the mill, and the leather, and the slaves’ stores,” and the rest of his inheritance in Chanaan71,
would never have chosen this lot, which now makes him so angry. It was to be expected that
he would revile those who were the agents of this exile. I quite understand his feeling. Truly
the authors of these misfortunes, if such there be or ever have been, deserve the censures of
these men, in that the renown of their former lives is thereby obscured, and they are deprived
of the opportunity of mentioning and making much of their more impressive antecedents;
the great distinctions with which each started in life; the professions they inherited from
their fathers; the greater or the smaller marks of gentility of which each was conscious, even
before they became so widely known and valued that even emperors numbered them amongst
their acquaintance, as he now boasts in his book, and that all the higher governments were
roused about them and the world was filled with their doings.</p>

<head>§6. A notice of Aetius, Eunomius’ master in heresy, and of Eunomius himself, describing the
origin and avocations of each.</head>
<p>Verily this did great damage to our declamation-writer, or rather to his patron and
guide in life, Aetius; whose enthusiasm indeed appears to me to have aimed not so much
at the propagation of error as to the securing a competence for life. I do not say this as a
mere surmise of my own, but I have heard it from the lips of those who knew him well. I
have listened to Athanasius, the former bishop of the Galatians, when he was speaking of
the life of Aetius; Athanasius was a man who valued truth above all things; and he exhibited
also the letter of George of Laodicæa, so that a number might attest the truth of his words.
He told us that originally Aetius did not attempt to teach his monstrous doctrines, but only
after some interval of time put forth these novelties as a trick to gain his livelihood; that
having escaped from serfdom in the vineyard to which he belonged,—how, I do not wish
to say, lest I should be thought to be entering on his history in a bad spirit,—he became at
first a tinker, and had this grimy trade of a mechanic quite at his fingers’ end, sitting under
a goat’s-hair tent, with a small hammer, and a diminutive anvil, and so earned a precarious
and laborious livelihood. What income, indeed, of any account could be made by one who
mends the shaky places in coppers, and solders holes up, and hammers sheets of tin to pieces,
and clamps with lead the legs of pots? We were told that a certain incident which befell him
in this trade necessitated the next change in his life. He had received from a woman belonging
to a regiment a gold ornament, a necklace or a bracelet, which had been broken by a blow,
and which he was to mend: but he cheated the poor creature, by appropriating her gold
trinket, and giving her instead one of copper, of the same size, and also of the same appearance,
owing to a gold-wash which he had imparted to its surface; she was deceived by this
for a time, for he was clever enough in the tinker’s, as in other, arts to mislead his customers
with the tricks of trade; but at last she detected the rascality, for the wash got rubbed off the
copper; and, as some of the soldiers of her family and nation were roused to indignation,
she prosecuted the purloiner of her ornament. After this attempt he of course underwent a
cheating thief’s punishment; and then left the trade, swearing that it was not his deliberate
intention, but that business tempted him to commit this theft. After this he became assistant
to a certain doctor from amongst the quacks, so as not to be quite destitute of a livelihood;
and in this capacity he made his attack upon the obscurer households and on the most abject
of mankind. Wealth came gradually from his plots against a certain Armenius, who being
a foreigner was easily cheated, and, having been induced to make him his physician, had
advanced him frequent sums of money; and he began to think that serving under others
was beneath him, and wanted to be styled a physician himself. Henceforth, therefore, he
attended medical congresses, and consorting with the wrangling controversialists there became
one of the ranters, and, just as the scales were turning, always adding his own weight

<pb n="71"/>
to the argument, he got to be in no small request with those who would buy a brazen voice
for their party contests.</p>
<p>But although his bread became thereby well buttered he thought he ought not to remain
in such a profession; so he gradually gave up the medical, after the tinkering. Arius, the enemy
of God, had already sown those wicked tares which bore the Anomæans as their fruit, and
the schools of medicine resounded then with the disputes about that question. Accordingly
Aetius studied the controversy, and, having laid a train of syllogisms from what he remembered
of Aristotle, he became notorious for even going beyond Arius, the father of the
heresy, in the novel character of his speculations; or rather he perceived the consequences
of all that Arius had advanced, and so got this character of a shrewd discoverer of truths
not obvious; revealing as he did that the Created, even from things non-existent, was unlike
the Creator who drew Him out of nothing.</p>
<p>With such propositions he tickled ears that itched for these novelties; and the Ethiopian
Theophilus72 becomes acquainted with them. Aetius had already been connected with this
man on some business of Gallus; and now by his help creeps into the palace. After Gallus73
had perpetrated the tragedy with regard to Domitian the procurator and Montius, all the
other participators in it naturally shared his ruin; yet this man escapes, being acquitted from
being punished along with them. After this, when the great Athanasius had been driven by
Imperial command from the Church of Alexandria, and George the Tarbasthenite was
tearing his flock, another change takes place, and Aetius is an Alexandrian, receiving his
full share amongst those who fattened at the Cappadocian’s board; for he had not omitted
to practice his flatteries on George. George was in fact from Chanaan himself, and therefore
felt kindly towards a countryman: indeed he had been for long so possessed with his perverted
opinions as actually to dote upon him, and was prone to become a godsend for Aetius,
whenever he liked.</p>
<p>All this did not escape the notice of his sincere admirer, our Eunomius. This latter perceived
that his natural father—an excellent man, except that he had such a son—led a very
honest and respectable life certainly, but one of laborious penury and full of countless toils.
(He was one of those farmers who are always bent over the plough, and spend a world of
trouble over their little farm; and in the winter, when he was secured from agricultural work,
he used to carve out neatly the letters of the alphabet for boys to form syllables with, winning
his bread with the money these sold for.) Seeing all this in his father’s life, he said goodbye
<note type="footnote">72 Probably the ‘Indian’ Theophilus, who afterwards helped to organize the Anomoean schism in the reign
of Jovian.</note>
<note type="footnote">73 Gallus, Cæsar 350–354, brother of Julian, not a little influenced by Aetius, executed by Constantius at
Flanon in Dalmatia. During his short reign at Antioch, Domitian, who was sent to bring him to Italy, and his
quæstor Montius were dragged to death through the streets by the guards of the young Cæsar.</note>

<pb n="72"/>
to the plough and the mattock and all the paternal instruments, intending never to drudge
himself like that; then he sets himself to learn Prunicus’ skill74 of short-hand writing, and
having perfected himself in that he entered at first, I believe, the house of one of his own
family, receiving his board for his services in writing; then, while tutoring the boys of his
host, he rises to the ambition of becoming an orator. I pass over the next interval, both as
to his life in his native country and as to the things and the company in which he was discovered
at Constantinople.</p>
<p>Busied as he was after this ‘about the cloke and the purse,’ he saw it was all of little avail,
and that nothing which he could amass by such work was adequate to the demands of his
ambition. Accordingly he threw up all other practices, and devoted himself solely to the
admiration of Aetius; not, perhaps, without some calculation that this absorbing pursuit
which he selected might further his own devices for living. In fact, from the moment he
asked for a share in a wisdom so profound, he toiled not thenceforward, neither did he spin;
for he is certainly clever in what he takes in hand, and knows how to gain the more emotional
portion of mankind. Seeing that human nature, as a rule, falls an easy prey to pleasure, and
that its natural inclination in the direction of this weakness is very strong, descending from
the sterner heights of conduct to the smooth level of comfort, he becomes with a view of
making the largest number possible of proselytes to his pernicious opinions very pleasant
indeed to those whom he is initiating; he gets rid of the toilsome steep of virtue altogether,
because it is not a persuasive to accept his secrets. But should any one have the leisure to
inquire what this secret teaching of theirs is, and what those who have been duped to accept
this blighting curse utter without any reserve, and what in the mysterious ritual of initiation
they are taught by the reverend hierophant, the manner of baptisms75, and the ‘helps of
<note type="footnote">74 The same phrase occurs again: Refutation of Eunomius’ Second Essay, p. 844: οἱ τῇ προυνίκου σοφίU+0026 139·
ἐγγυμνασθέντες· ἐξ ἐκείνης γὰρ δοκεῖ μοι τῆς παρασκευῆς τὰ εἰρημένα προενηνοχέναι· In the last word there
is evidently a pun on προυνίκου; προφερὴς, in the secondary sense of ‘precocious,’ is used by Iamblichus and
Porphyry, and προύνικος appears to have had the same meaning. We might venture, therefore, to translate ‘that
knowing trick’ of short-hand: but why Prunicus is personified, if it is personified, as in the Gnostic Prunicos
Sophia, does not appear. See Epiphanius Hæres. 253 for the feminine Proper name. The other possible explanation
is that given in the margin of the Paris Edition, and is based on Suidas, i.e. Prunici sunt cursores celeres; hic pro celer
scriba. Hesychius also says of the word; οἱ μισθοῦ κομίζοντες τὰ ὤνια ἀπὸ τῆς ἀγορᾶς, οὕς τινες παιδαριωνας καλοῦσιν,
δρομεῖς, τραχεῖς, ὀξεῖς, εὐκίνητοι, γοργοί, μισθωτοί. Here such ‘porter’s’ skill, easy going and superficial, is opposed to
the more laborious task of tilling the soil.</note>
<note type="footnote">75 For the baptisms of Eunomius, compare Epiphanius Hær. 765. Even Arians who were not Anomoeans he
rebaptized. The ‘helps of nature’ may possibly refer to the ‘miracles’ which Philostorgius ascribes both to Aetius
and Eunomius. Sozomen (vi. 26) says, “Eunomius introduced, it is said, a mode of discipline contrary to that of the
Church, and endeavoured to disguise the innovation under the cloak of a grave and severe deportment.”…His followers
“do not applaud a virtuous course of life…so much as skill in disputation and the power of triumphing in debates.”</note>

nature,’ and all that, let him question those who feel no compunction in letting indecencies
pass their lips; we shall keep silent. For not even though we are the accusers should we be
guiltless in mentioning such things, and we have been taught to reverence purity in word
as well as deed, and not to soil our pages with equivocal stories, even though there be truth
in what we say.</p>
<p>But we mention what we then heard (namely that, just as Aristotle’s evil skill supplied
Aetius with his impiety, so the simplicity of his dupes secured a fat living for the well-trained
pupil as well as for the master) for the purpose of asking some questions. What after all was
the great damage done him by Basil on the Euxine, or by Eustathius in Armenia, to both of
whom that long digression in his story harks back? How did they mar the aim of his life?
Did they not rather feed up his and his companion’s freshly acquired fame? Whence came
their wide notoriety, if not through the instrumentality of these men, supposing, that is,
that their accuser is speaking the truth? For the fact that men, themselves illustrious, as our
writer owns, deigned to fight with those who had as yet found no means of being known
naturally gave the actual start to the ambitious thoughts of those who were to be pitted
against these reputed heroes; and a veil was thereby thrown over their humble antecedents.
They in fact owed their subsequent notoriety to this,—a thing detestable indeed to a reflecting
mind which would never choose to rest fame upon an evil deed, but the acme of bliss to
characters such as these. They tell of one in the province of Asia, amongst the obscurest and
the basest, who longed to make a name in Ephesus; some great and brilliant achievement
being quite beyond his powers never even entered his mind; and yet, by hitting upon that
which would most deeply injure the Ephesians, he made his mark deeper than the heroes
of the grandest actions; for there was amongst their public buildings one noticeable for its
peculiar magnificence and costliness; and he burnt this vast structure to the ground, showing,
when men came to inquire after the perpetration of this villany into its mental causes, that
he dearly prized notoriety, and had devised that the greatness of the disaster should secure
the name of its author being recorded with it. The secret motive76 of these two men is the
same thirst for publicity; the only difference is that the amount of mischief is greater in their
case. They are marring, not lifeless architecture, but the living building of the Church, introducing,
for fire, the slow canker of their teaching. But I will defer the doctrinal question till
the proper time comes.</p>

<head>§7. Eunomius himself proves that the confession of faith which He made was not impeached.</head>
<p>Let us see for a moment now what kind of truth is dealt with by this man, who in his
Introduction complains that it is because of his telling the truth that he is hated by the unbelievers;
we may well make the way he handles truth outside doctrine teach us a test to
apply to his doctrine itself. “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much,
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.” Now, when he is beginning to write
this “apology for the apology” (that is the new and startling title, as well as subject, of his
book) he says that we must look for the cause of this very startling announcement nowhere
else but in him who answered that first treatise of his. That book was entitled an Apology;
but being given to understand by our master-theologian that an apology can only come
from those who have been accused of something, and that if a man writes merely from his
own inclination his production is something else than an apology, he does not deny—it
would be too manifestly absurd—77that an apology requires a preceding accusation; but he
declares that his ‘apology’ has cleared him from very serious accusations in the trial which
has been instituted against him. How false this is, is manifest from his own words. He
complained that “many heavy sufferings were inflicted on him by those who had condemned
him”; we may read that in his book.</p>
<p>But how could he have suffered so, if his ‘apology’ cleared him of these charges? If he
successfully adopted an apology to escape from these, that pathetic complaint of his is a
hypocritical pretence; if on the other hand he really suffered as he says, then, plainly, he
suffered because he did not clear himself by an apology; for every apology, to be such, has
to secure this end, namely, to prevent the voting power from being misled by any false
statements. Surely he will not now attempt to say that at the time of the trial he produced
his apology, but not being able to win over the jury lost the case to the prosecution. For he
said nothing at the time of the trial ‘about producing his apology;’ nor was it likely that he
would, considering that he distinctly states in his book that he refused to have anything to
do with those ill-affected and hostile dicasts. “We own,” he says, “that we were condemned
by default: there was a packed78 panel of evil-disposed persons where a jury ought to have
sat.” He is very labored here, and has his attention diverted by his argument, I think, or he
would have noticed that he has tacked on a fine solecism to his sentence. He affects to be
<note type="footnote">77 The μὴ is redundant and owing to οὐκ.</note>
<note type="footnote">78 Εἰςφρησάντων. A word used in Aristophanes of ‘letting into court,’ probably a technical word: it is a
manifest derivation from εἰσφορεῖν. What the solecism is, is not clear; Gretser thinks that Eunomius meant it
for εἰσπηδᾶν</note>

<pb n="75"/>
imposingly Attic with his phrase ‘packed panel;’ but the correct in language use these words,
as those familiar with the forensic vocabulary know, quite differently to our new Atticist.</p>
<p>A little further on he adds this; “If he thinks that, because I would have nothing to do
with a jury who were really my prosecutors he can argue away my apology, he must be blind
to his own simplicity.” When, then, and before whom did our caustic friend make his apology?
He had demurred to the jury because they were ‘foes,’ and he did not utter one word
about any trial, as he himself insists. See how this strenuous champion of the true, little by
little, passes over to the side of the false, and, while honouring truth in phrase, combats it
in deed. But it is amusing to see how weak he is even in seconding his own lie. How can one
and the same man have ‘cleared himself by an apology in the trial which was instituted
against him,’ and then have ‘prudently kept silence because the court was in the hands of
the foe?’ Nay, the very language he uses in the preface to his Apology clearly shows that no
court at all was opened against him. For he does not address his preface to any definite jury,
but to certain unspecified persons who were living then, or who were afterwards to come
into the world; and I grant that to such an audience there was need of a very vigorous apology,
not indeed in the manner of the one he has actually written, which requires another still to
bolster it up, but a broadly intelligible one79, able to prove this special point, viz., that he
was not in the possession of his usual reason when he wrote this, wherein he rings80 the
assembly-bell for men who never came, perhaps never existed, and speaks an apology before
an imaginary court, and begs an imperceptible jury not to let numbers decide between truth
and falsehood, nor to assign the victory to mere quantity. Verily it is becoming that he
should make an apology of that sort to jurymen who are yet in the loins of their fathers, and
to explain to them how he came to think it right to adopt opinions which contradict universal
belief, and to put more faith in his own mistaken fancies than in those who throughout the
world glorify Christ’s name.</p>
<p>Let him write, please, another apology in addition to this second; for this one is not a
correction of mistakes made about him, but rather a proof of the truth of those charges.
Every one knows that a proper apology aims at disproving a charge; thus a man who is accused
of theft or murder or any other crime either denies the fact altogether, or transfers
the blame to another party, or else, if neither of these is possible, he appeals to the charity
or to the compassion of those who are to vote upon his sentence. But in his book he neither
denies the charge, nor shifts it on some one else, nor has recourse to an appeal for mercy,
nor promises amendment for the future; but he establishes the charge against him by an
unusually labored demonstration. This charge, as he himself confesses, really amounted to
<note type="footnote">79 γενικῆς.</note>
<note type="footnote">80 συνεκρότει. The word has this meaning in Origen. In Philo (de Vitâ Mosis, p. 476, l. 48, quoted by Viger.),
it has another meaning, συνεκρότουν ἄλλος ἄλλον, μὴ ἀποκάμνειν, i.e. ‘cheered.’</note>

<pb n="76"/>
an indictment for profanity, nor did it leave the nature of this undefined, but proclaimed
the particular kind; whereas his apology proves this species of profanity to be a positive
duty, and instead of removing the charge strengthens it. Now, if the tenets of our Faith had
been left in any obscurity, it might have been less hazardous to attempt novelties; but the
teaching of our master-theologian is now firmly fixed in the souls of the faithful; and so it
is a question whether the man who shouts out contradictions of that about which all equally
have made up their minds is defending himself against the charges made, or is not rather
drawing down upon him the anger of his hearers, and making his accusers still more bitter.
I incline to think the latter. So that if there are, as our writer tells us, both hearers of his
apology and accusers of his attempts upon the Faith, let him tell us, how those accusers can
possibly compromise81 the matter now, or what sort of verdict that jury must return, now
that his offence has been already proved by his own ‘apology.’</p>

<head>§8. Facts show that the terms of abuse which he has employed against Basil are more suitable
for himself.</head>
<p>But these remarks are by the way, and come from our not keeping close to our argument.
We had to inquire not how he ought to have made his apology, but whether he had ever
made one at all. But now let us return to our former position, viz., that he is convicted by
his own statements. This hater of falsehood first of all tells us that he was condemned because
the jury which was assigned him defied the law, and that he was driven over sea and land
and suffered much from the burning sun and the dust. Then in trying to conceal his falsehood
he drives out one nail with another nail, as the proverb says, and puts one falsehood right
by cancelling it with another. As every one knows as well as he does that he never uttered
one word in court, he declares that he begged to be let off coming into a hostile court and
was condemned by default. Could there be a plainer case than this of a man contradicting
both the truth and himself? When he is pressed about the title of his book, he makes his
trial the constraining cause of this ‘apology;’ but when he is pressed with the fact that he
spoke not one word to the jury, he denies that there was any trial and says that he declined82
such a jury. See how valiantly this doughty champion of the truth fights against falsehood!
Then he dares to call our mighty Basil ‘a malicious rascal and a liar;’ and besides that, ‘a
bold ignorant parvenu83,’ ‘no deep divine,’ and he adds to his list of abusive terms, ‘stark
mad,’ scattering an infinity of such words over his pages, as if he imagined that his own
bitter invectives could outweigh the common testimony of mankind, who revere that great
name as though he were one of the saints of old. He thinks in fact that he, if no one else, can
touch with calumny one whom calumny has never touched; but the sun is not so low in the
heavens that any one can reach him with stones or any other missiles; they will but recoil
upon him who shot them, while the intended target soars far beyond his reach. If any one,
again, accuses the sun of want of light, he has not dimmed the brightness of the sunbeams
with his scoffs; the sun will still remain the sun, and the fault-finder will only prove the
feebleness of his own visual organs; and, if he should endeavour, after the fashion of this
‘apology,’ to persuade all whom he meets and will listen to him not to give in to the common
opinions about the sun, nor to attach more weight to the experiences of all than to the surmises
of one individual by ‘assigning victory to mere quantity,’ his nonsense will be wasted
on those who can use their eyes.</p>
<p>Let some one then persuade Eunomius to bridle his tongue, and not give the rein to
such wild talk, nor kick against the pricks in the insolent abuse of an honoured name; but
to allow the mere remembrance of Basil to fill his soul with reverence and awe. What can
he gain by this unmeasured ribaldry, when the object of it will retain all that character which

<pb n="78"/>
his life, his words, and the general estimate of the civilized world proclaims him to have
possessed? The man who takes in hand to revile reveals his own disposition as not being
able, because it is evil, to speak good things, but only “to speak from the abundance of the
heart,” and to bring forth from that evil treasure-house. Now, that his expressions are merely
those of abuse quite divorced from actual facts, can be proved from his own writings.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">  
<pb n="79"/>
<head>§9. In charging Basil with not defending his faith at the time of the ‘Trials,’ he lays himself
open to the same charge.</head>
<p>He hints at a certain locality where this trial for heresy took place; but he gives us no
certain indication where it was, and the reader is obliged to guess in the dark. Thither, he
tells us, a congress of picked representatives from all quarters was summoned; and he is at
his best here, placing before our eyes with some vigorous strokes the preparation of the
event which he pretends took place. Then, he says, a trial in which he would have had to
run for his very life was put into the hands of certain arbitrators, to whom our Teacher and
Master who was present gave his charge84; and as all the voting power was thus won over
to the enemies’ side, he yielded the position85, fled from the place, and hunted everywhere
for some hearth and home; and he is great, in this graphic sketch86, in arraigning the cowardice
of our hero; as any one who likes may see by looking at what he has written. But I
cannot stop to give specimens here of the bitter gall of his utterances; I must pass on to that,
for the sake of which I mentioned all this.</p>
<p>Where, then, was that unnamed spot in which this examination of his teachings was to
take place? What was this occasion when the best then were collected for a trial? Who were
these men who hurried over land and sea to share in these labours? What was this ‘expectant
world that hung upon the issue of the voting?’ Who was ‘the arranger of the trial?’ However,
let us consider that he invented all that to swell out the importance of his story, as boys at
school are apt to do in their fictitious conversations of this kind; and let him only tell us
who that ‘terrible combatant’ was whom our Master shrunk from encountering. If this also
is a fiction, let him be the winner again, and have the advantage of his vain words. We will
say nothing: in the useless fight with shadows the real victory is to decline conquering in
that. But if he speaks of the events at Constantinople and means the assembly there, and is
in this fever of literary indignation at tragedies enacted there, and means himself by that
great and redoubtable athlete, then we would display the reasons why, though present on
the occasion, we did not plunge into the fight.</p>
<p>Now let this man who upbraids that hero with his cowardice tell us whether he went
down into the thick of the fray, whether he uttered one syllable in defence of his own orthodoxy,
whether he made any vigorous peroration, whether he victoriously grappled with the
<note type="footnote">84 ὑποφωνεῖν</note>
<note type="footnote">85 Sozomen (vi. 26): “After his (Eunomius) elevation to the bishopric of Cyzicus he was accused by his own

doctrines to the people: finding, however, no fault in him, Eudoxius exhorted him to return to Cyzicus. He
replied he could not remain with people who regarded him with suspicion, and it is said seized this opportunity
to secede from communion.”</note>

<pb n="80"/>
foe? He cannot tell us that, or he manifestly contradicts himself, for he owns that by his default
he received the adverse verdict. If it was a duty to speak at the actual time of the trial
(for that is the law which he lays down for us in his book), then why was he then condemned
by default? If on the other hand he did well in observing silence before such dicasts, how
arbitrarily87 he praises himself, but blames us, for silence at such a time! What can be more
absurdly unjust than this! When two treatises have been put forth since the time of the trial,
he declares that his apology, though written so very long after, was in time, but reviles that
which answered his own as quite too late! Surely he ought to have abused Basil’s intended
counter-statement before it was actually made; but this is not found amongst his other
complaints. Knowing as he did what Basil was going to write when the time of the trial had
passed away, why in the world did he not find fault with it there and then? In fact it is clear
from his own confession that he never made that apology in the trial itself. I will repeat again
his words:—‘We confess that we were condemned by default;’ and he adds why; ‘Evil-disposed
persons had been passed as jurymen,’ or rather, to use his own phrase, ‘there was a packed
panel of them where a jury ought to have sat.’ Whereas, on the other hand, it is clear from
another passage in his book that he attests that his apology was made ‘at the proper time.’
It runs thus:—“That I was urged to make this apology at the proper time and in the proper
manner from no pretended reasons, but compelled to do so on behalf of those who went
security for me, is clear from facts and also from this man’s words.” He adroitly twists his
words round to meet every possible objection; but what will he say to this? ‘It was not right
to keep silent during the trial.’ Then why was Eunomius speechless during that same trial?
And why is his apology, coming as it did after the trial, in good time? And if in good time,
why is Basil’s controversy with him not in good time?</p>
<p>But the remark of that holy father is especially true, that Eunomius in pretending to
make an apology really gave his teaching the support he wished to give it; and that genuine
emulator of Phineas’ zeal, destroying as he does with the sword of the Word every spiritual
fornicator, dealt in the ‘Answer to his blasphemy’ a sword-thrust that was calculated at once
to heal a soul and to destroy a heresy. If he resists that stroke, and with a soul deadened by
apostacy will not admit the cure, the blame rests with him who chooses the evil, as the
Gentile proverb says. So far for Eunomius’ treatment of truth, and of us: and now the law
of former times, which allows an equal return on those who are the first to injure, might
prompt us to discharge on him a counter-shower of abuse, and, as he is a very easy subject
for this, to be very liberal of it, so as to outdo the pain which he has inflicted: for if he was
so rich in insolent invective against one who gave no chance for calumny, how many of
such epithets might we not expect to find for those who have satirized that saintly life? But
we have been taught from the first by that scholar of the Truth to be scholars of the Gospel

ourselves, and therefore we will not take an eye for an eye, nor a tooth for a tooth; we know
well that all the evil that happens admits of being annihilated by its opposite, and that no
bad word and no bad deed would ever develope into such desperate wickedness, if one good
one could only be got in to break the continuity of the vicious stream. Therefore the routine
of insolence and abusiveness is checked from repeating itself by long-suffering: whereas if
insolence is met with insolence and abuse with abuse, you will but feed with itself this
monster-vice, and increase it vastly.</p>

<head>§10. All his insulting epithets are shewn by facts to be false.</head>
<p>I therefore pass over everything else, as mere insolent mockery and scoffing abuse, and
hasten to the question of his doctrine. Should any one say that I decline to be abusive only
because I cannot pay him back in his own coin, let such an one consider in his own case
what proneness there is to evil generally, what a mechanical sliding into sin, dispensing with
the need of any practice. The power of becoming bad resides in the will; one act of wishing
is often the sufficient occasion for a finished wickedness; and this ease of operation is more
especially fatal in the sins of the tongue. Other classes of sins require time and occasion and
co-operation to be committed; but the propensity to speak can sin when it likes. The treatise
of Eunomius now in our hands is sufficient to prove this; one who attentively considers it
will perceive the rapidity of the descent into sins in the matter of phrases: and it is the easiest
thing in the world to imitate these, even though one is quite unpractised in habitual defamation.
What need would there be to labour in coining our intended insults into names, when
one might employ upon this slanderer his own phrases? He has strung together, in fact, in
this part of his work, every sort of falsehood and evil-speaking, all moulded from the models
which he finds in himself; every extravagance is to be found in writing these. He writes
“cunning,” “wrangling,” “foe to truth,” “high-flown88,” “charlatan,” “combating general
opinion and tradition,” “braving facts which give him the lie,” “careless of the terrors of the
law, of the censure of men,” “unable to distinguish the enthusiasm for truth from mere skill
in reasoning;” he adds, “wanting in reverence,” “quick to call names,” and then “blatant,”
“full of conflicting suspicions,” “combining irreconcileable arguments,” “combating his own
utterances,” “affirming contradictories;” then, though eager to speak all ill of him, not being
able to find other novelties of invective in which to indulge his bitterness, often in default
of all else he reiterates the same phrases, and comes round again a third and a fourth time
and even more to what he has once said; and in this circus of words he drives up and then
turns down, over and over again, the same racecourse of insolent abuse; so that at last even
anger at this shameless display dies away from very weariness. These low unlovely street
boys’ jeers do indeed provoke disgust rather than anger; they are not a whit better than the
inarticulate grunting of some old woman who is quite drunk.</p>
<p>Must we then enter minutely into this, and laboriously refute all his invectives by
showing that Basil was not this monster of his imagination? If we did this, contentedly
proving the absence of anything vile and criminal in him, we should seem to join in insulting
one who was a ‘bright particular star’ to his generation. But I remember how with that divine
voice of his he quoted the prophet89 with regard to him, comparing him to a shameless
woman who casts her own reproaches on the chaste. For whom do these reasonings of his
<note type="footnote">88 σοφίστης</note>
<note type="footnote">89 Jeremiah iii. 3.</note>

<pb n="83"/>
proclaim to be truth’s enemy and in arms against public opinion? Who is it who begs the
readers of his book not ‘to look to the numbers of those who profess a belief, or to mere
tradition, or to let their judgment be biassed so as to consider as trustworthy what is only
suspected to be the stronger side?’ Can one and the same man write like this, and then make
those charges, scheming that his readers should follow his own novelties at the very moment
that he is abusing others for opposing themselves to the general belief? As for ‘brazening
out facts which give him the lie, and men’s censure,’ I leave the reader to judge to whom
this applies; whether to one who by a most careful self-restraint made sobriety and quietness
and perfect purity the rule of his own life as well as that of his entourage, or to one who advised
that nature should not be molested when it is her pleasure to advance through the
appetites of the body, not to thwart indulgence, nor to be so particular as that in the training
of our life; but that a self-chosen faith should be considered sufficient for a man to attain
perfection. If he denies that this is his teaching, I and any right-minded person would rejoice
if he were telling the truth in such a denial. But his genuine followers will not allow him to
produce such a denial, or their leading principles would be gone, and the platform of those
who for this reason embrace his tenets would fall to pieces. As for shameless indifference
to human censure, you may look at his youth or his after life, and you would find him in
both open to this reproach. The two men’s lives, whether in youth or manhood, tell a widelydifferent
tale.</p>
<p>Let our speech-writer, while he reminds himself of his youthful doings in his native
land, and afterwards at Constantinople, hear from those who can tell him what they know
of the man whom he slanders. But if any would inquire into their subsequent occupations,
let such a person tell us which of the two he considers to deserve so high a reputation; the
man who ungrudgingly spent upon the poor his patrimony even before he was a priest, and
most of all in the time of the famine, during which he was a ruler of the Church, though
still a priest in the rank of presbyters90; and afterwards did not hoard even what remained
to him, so that he too might have made the Apostles’ boast, ‘Neither did we eat any man’s
bread for nought91;’ or, on the other hand, the man who has made the championship of a
tenet a source of income, the man who creeps into houses, and does not conceal his loathsome
affliction by staying at home, nor considers the natural aversion which those in good health
must feel for such, though according to the law of old he is one of those who are banished
from the inhabited camp because of the contagion of his unmistakeable92 disease.</p>
<p>Basil is called ‘hasty’ and ‘insolent,’ and in both characters ‘a liar’ by this man who ‘would
in patience and meekness educate those of a contrary opinion to himself;’ for such are the

<note type="footnote">92 According to Ruffinus (Hist. Eccl. x. 25), his constitution was poisoned with jaundice within and without.</note>

<pb n="84"/>
airs he gives himself when he speaks of him, while he omits no hyperbole of bitter language,
when he has a sufficient opening to produce it. On what grounds, then, does he charge him
with this hastiness and insolence? Because ‘he called me a Galatian, though I am a Cappadocian;’
then it was because he called a man who lived on the boundary in an obscure corner
like Corniaspine93 a Galatian instead of an Oltiserian; supposing, that is, that it is proved
that he said this. I have not found it in my copies; but grant it. For this he is to be called
‘hasty,’ ‘insolent,’ all that is bad. But the wise know well that the minute charges of a faultfinder
furnish a strong argument for the righteousness of the accused; else, when eager to
accuse, he would not have spared great faults and employed his malice on little ones. On
these last he is certainly great, heightening the enormity of the offence, and making solemn
reflections on falsehood, and seeing equal heinousness in it whether in great or very trivial
matters. Like the fathers of his heresy, the scribes and Pharisees, he knows how to strain a
gnat carefully and to swallow at one gulp the hump-backed camel laden with a weight of
wickedness. But it would not be out of place to say to him, ‘refrain from making such a rule
in our system; cease to bid us think it of no account to measure the guilt of a falsehood by
the slightness or the importance of the circumstances.’ Paul telling a falsehood and purifying
himself after the manner of the Jews to meet the needs of those whom he usefully deceived
did not sin the same as Judas for the requirement of his treachery putting on a kind and affable
look. By a falsehood Joseph in love to his brethren deceived them; and that too while
swearing ‘by the life of Pharaoh94;’ but his brethren had really lied to him, in their envy
plotting his death and then his enslavement. There are many such cases: Sarah lied, because
she was ashamed of laughing: the serpent lied, tempting man to disobey and change to a
divine existence. Falsehoods differ widely according to their motives. Accordingly we accept
that general statement about man which the Holy Spirit uttered by the Prophet95, ‘Every
man is a liar;’ and this man of God, too, has not kept clear of falsehood, having chanced to
give a place the name of a neighbouring district, through oversight or ignorance of its real
name. But Eunomius also has told a falsehood, and what is it? Nothing less than a misstatement
of Truth itself. He asserts that One who always is once was not; he demonstrates that

In the next sentence εἰ ἀντὶ, though it gives the sense translated in the text, is not so good as ᾗ ἀντὶ (i.e. ἐσχατία),
which Oehler suggests, but does not adopt. With regard to Eunomius’ birthplace, Sozomen and Philostorgius give
Dacora (which the former describes as on the slopes of Mt. Argæus: but that it must have been on the borders of Galatia
and Cappadocia is certain from what Gregory says here): ‘Probably Dacora was his paternal estate: Oltiseris the village
to which it belonged’ (Dict. Christ. Biog.; unless indeed Corniaspa, marked on the maps as a town where Cappadocia,

<head>§11. The sophistry which he employs to prove our acknowledgment that he had been tried,
and that the confession of his faith had not been unimpeached, is feeble.</head>
<p>He objects to sophistries in others; see the sort of care he takes himself that his proofs
shall be real ones. Our Master said, in the book which he addressed to him, that at the time
when our cause was ruined, Eunomius won Cyzicus as the prize of his blasphemy. What
then does this detector of sophistry do? He fastens at once on that word prize, and declares
that we on our side confess that he made an apology, that he won thereby, that he gained
the prize of victory by these efforts; and he frames his argument into a syllogism consisting
as he thinks of unanswerable propositions. But we will quote word for word what he has
written. ‘If a prize is the recognition and the crown of victory, and a trial implies a victory,
and, as also inseparable from itself, an accusation, then that man who grants (in argument)
the prize must necessarily allow that there was a defence.’ What then is our answer to that?
We do not deny that he fought this wretched battle of impiety with a most vigorous energy,
and that he went a very long distance beyond his fellows in these perspiring efforts against
the truth; but we will not allow that he obtained the victory over his opponents; but only
that as compared with those who were running the same as himself through heresy into
error he was foremost in the number of his lies and so gained the prize of Cyzicus in return
for high attainments in evil, beating all who for the same prize combated the Truth; and
that for this victory of blasphemy his name was blazoned loud and clear when Cyzicus was
selected for him by the umpires of his party as the reward of his extravagance. This is the
statement of our opinion, and this we allowed; our contention now that Cyzicus was the
prize of a heresy, not the successful result of a defence, shews it. Is this anything like his own
mess of childish sophistries, so that he can thereby hope to have grounds for proving the
fact of his trial and his defence? His method is like that of a man in a drinking bout, who
has made away with more strong liquor than the rest, and having then claimed the pool
from his fellow-drunkards should attempt to make this victory a proof of having won some
case in the law courts. That man might chop the same sort of logic. ‘If a prize is the recognition
and the crown of victory, and a law-trial implies a victory and, as also inseparable from
itself, an accusation, then I have won my suit, since I have been crowned for my powers of
drinking in this bout.’</p>
<p>One would certainly answer to such a boaster that a trial in court is a very different
thing from a wine-contest, and that one who wins with the glass has thereby no advantage
over his legal adversaries, though he get a beautiful chaplet of flowers. No more, therefore,
has the man who has beaten his equals in the advocacy of profanity anything to show in
having won the prize for that, that he has won a verdict too. The testimony on our side that
he is first in profanity is no plea for his imaginary ‘apology.’ If he did speak it before the
court, and, having so prevailed over his adversaries, was honoured with Cyzicus for that,
then he might have some occasion for using our own words against ourselves; but as he is

<pb n="87"/>
continually protesting in his book that he yielded to the animus of the voters, and accepted
in silence the penalty which they inflicted, not even waiting for this hostile decision, why
does he impose upon himself and make this word prize into the proof of a successful apology?
Our excellent friend fails to understand the force of this word prize; Cyzicus was given up
to him as the reward of merit for his extravagant impiety; and as it was his will to receive
such a prize, and he views it in the light of a victor’s guerdon, let him receive as well what
that victory implies, viz. the lion’s share in the guilt of profanity. If he insists on our own
words against ourselves, he must accept both these consequences, or neither.</p>

<head>§12. His charge of cowardice is baseless: for Basil displayed the highest courage before the
Emperor and his Lord-Lieutenants.</head>
<p>He treats our words so; and in the rest of his presumptuous statements can there be
shown to be a particle of truth? In these he calls him ‘cowardly,’ ‘spiritless,’ ‘a shirker of
severer labours,’ exhausting the list of such terms, and giving with laboured circumstantiality
every symptom of this cowardice: ‘the retired cabin, the door firmly closed, the anxious fear
of intruders, the voice, the look, the tell-tale change of countenance,’ everything of that sort,
whereby the passion of fear is shown. If he were detected in no other lie but this, it alone
would be sufficient to reveal his bent. For who does not know how, during the time when
the Emperor Valens was roused against the churches of the Lord, that mighty champion of
ours rose by his lofty spirit superior to those overwhelming circumstances and the terrors
of the foe, and showed a mind which soared above every means devised to daunt him? Who
of the dwellers in the East, and of the furthest regions of our civilized world did not hear of
his combat with the throne itself for the truth? Who, looking to his antagonist, was not in
dismay? For his was no common antagonist, possessed only of the power of winning in
sophistic juggles, where victory is no glory and defeat is harmless; but he had the power of
bending the whole Roman government to his will; and, added to this pride of empire, he
had prejudices against our faith, cunningly instilled into his mind by Eudoxius97 of Germanicia98,
who had won him to his side; and he found in all those who were then at the head of
affairs allies in carrying out his designs, some being already inclined to them from mental
sympathies, while others, and they were the majority, were ready from fear to indulge the
imperial pleasure, and seeing the severity employed against those who held to the Faith were
ostentatious in their zeal for him. It was a time of exile, confiscation, banishment, threats
of fines, danger of life, arrests, imprisonment, scourging; nothing was too dreadful to put
in force against those who would not yield to this sudden caprice of the Emperor; it was
worse for the faithful to be caught in God’s house than if they had been detected in the most
heinous of crimes.</p>
<p>But a detailed history of that time would be too long; and would require a separate
treatment; besides, as the sufferings at that sad season are known to all, nothing would be
gained for our present purpose by carefully setting them forth in writing. A second drawback
to such an attempt would be found to be that amidst the details of that melancholy history

all the Arians. He it was who procured for Eunomius the bishopric of Cyzicus (359). (The latter must indeed

we should be forced to make mention of ourselves; and if we did anything in those struggles
for our religion that redounds to our honour in the telling, Wisdom commands us to leave
it to others to tell. “Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth99;” and it is this
very thing that our omniscient friend has not been conscious of in devoting the larger half
of his book to self-glorification.</p>
<p>Omitting, then, all that kind of detail, I will be careful only in setting forth the achievement
of our Master. The adversary whom he had to combat was no less a person than the
Emperor himself; that adversary’s second was the man who stood next him in the government;
his assistants to work out his will were the court. Let us take into consideration also
the point of time, in order to test and to illustrate the fortitude of our own noble champion.
When was it? The Emperor was proceeding from Constantinople to the East elated by his
recent successes against the barbarians, and not in a spirit to brook any obstruction to his
will; and his lord-lieutenant directed his route, postponing all administration of the necessary
affairs of state as long as a home remained to one adherent of the Faith, and until every one,
no matter where, was ejected, and others, chosen by himself to outrage our godly hierarchy,
were introduced instead. The Powers then of the Propontis were moving in such a fury, like
some dark cloud, upon the churches; Bithynia was completely devastated; Galatia was very
quickly carried away by their stream; all in the intervening districts had succeeded with
them; and now our fold lay the next to be attacked. What did our mighty Basil show like
then, ‘that spiritless coward,’ as Eunomius calls him, ‘shrinking from danger, and trusting
to a retired cabin to save him?’ Did he quail at this evil onset? Did he allow the sufferings
of previous victims to suggest to him that he should secure his own safety? Did he listen to
any who advised a slight yielding to this rush of evils100, so as not to throw himself openly
in the path of men who were now veterans in slaughter? Rather we find that all excess of
language, all height of thought and word, falls short of the truth about him. None could
describe his contempt of danger, so as to bring before the reader’s eyes this new combat,
which one might justly say was waged not between man and man, but between a Christian’s
firmness and courage on the one side, and a bloodstained power on the other.</p>
<p>The lord-lieutenant kept appealing to the commands of the Emperor, and rendering a
power, which from its enormous strength was terrible enough, more terrible still by the
unsparing cruelty of its vengeance. After the tragedies which he had enacted in Bithynia,
and after Galatia with characteristic fickleness had yielded without a struggle, he thought
that our country would fall a ready prey to his designs. Cruel deeds were preluded by words
proposing, with mingled threats and promises, royal favours and ecclesiastical power to
<note type="footnote">99 Proverbs xxvii. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">100 ‘The metropolitan remained unshaken. The rough threats of Modestus succeeded no better than the
fatherly counsel of Enippius.’ Gwatkins Arians.</note>

<pb n="90"/>
obedience, but to resistance all that a cruel spirit which has got the power to work its will
can devise. Such was the enemy.</p>
<p>So far was our champion from being daunted by what he saw and heard, that he acted
rather like a physician or prudent councillor called in to correct something that was wrong,
bidding them repent of their rashness and cease to commit murders amongst the servants
of the Lord; ‘their plans,’ he said, ‘could not succeed with men who cared only for the empire
of Christ, and for the Powers that never die; with all their wish to maltreat him, they could
discover nothing, whether word or act, that could pain the Christian; confiscation could
not touch him whose only possession was his Faith; exile had no terrors for one who walked
in every land with the same feelings, and looked on every city as strange because of the
shortness of his sojourn in it, yet as home, because all human creatures are in equal bondage
with himself; the endurance of blows, or tortures, or death, if it might be for the Truth, was
an object of fear not even to women, but to every Christian it was the supremest bliss to
suffer the worst for this their hope, and they were only grieved that nature allowed them
but one death, and that they could devise no means of dying many times in this battle for
the Truth101.’</p>
<p>When he thus confronted their threats, and looked beyond that imposing power, as if
it were all nothing, then their exasperation, just like those rapid changes on the stage when
one mask after another is put on, turned with all its threats into flattery; and the very man
whose spirit up to then had been so determined and formidable adopted the most gentle
and submissive of language; ‘Do not, I beg you, think it a small thing for our mighty emperor
to have communion with your people, but be willing to be called his master too: nor thwart
his wish; he wishes for this peace, if only one little word in the written Creed is erased, that
of Homoousios.’ Our master answers that it is of the greatest importance that the emperor
should be a member of the Church; that is, that he should save his soul, not as an emperor,
but as a mere man; but a diminution of or addition to the Faith was so far from his (Basil’s)
thoughts, that he would not change even the order of the written words. That was what this
‘spiritless coward, who trembles at the creaking of a door,’ said to this great ruler, and he
confirmed his words by what he did; for he stemmed in his own person this imperial torrent
of ruin that was rushing on the churches, and turned it aside; he in himself was a match for
this attack, like a grand immoveable rock in the sea, breaking the huge and surging billow
of that terrible onset.</p>
<p>Nor did his wrestling stop there; the emperor himself succeeds to the attack, exasperated
because he did not get effected in the first attempt all that he wished. Just, accordingly, as
the Assyrian effected the destruction of the temple of the Israelites at Jerusalem by means

of the cook Nabuzardan, so did this monarch of ours entrust his business to one Demosthenes,
comptroller of his kitchen, and chief of his cooks102, as to one more pushing than
the rest, thinking thereby to succeed entirely in his design. With this man stirring the pot,
and with one of the blasphemers from Illyricum, letters in hand, assembling the authorities
with this end in view, and with Modestus103 kindling passion to a greater heat than in the
previous excitement, every one joined the movement of the Emperor’s anger, making his
fury their own, and yielding to the temper of authority; and on the other hand all felt their
hopes sink at the prospect of what might happen. That same lord-lieutenant re-enters on
the scene; intimidations worse than the former are begun; their threats are thrown out; their
anger rises to a still higher pitch; there is the tragic pomp of trial over again, the criers, the
apparitors, the lictors, the curtained bar, things which naturally daunt even a mind which
is thoroughly prepared; and again we see God’s champion amidst this combat surpassing
even his former glory. If you want proofs, look at the facts. What spot, where there are
churches, did not that disaster reach? What nation remained unreached by these heretical
commands? Who of the illustrious in any Church was not driven from the scene of his labours?
What people escaped their despiteful treatment? It reached all Syria, and Mesopotamia
up to the frontier, Phoenicia, Palestine, Arabia, Egypt, the Libyan tribes to the boundaries
of the civilized world; and all nearer home, Pontus, Cilicia, Lycia, Lydia, Pisidia, Pamphylia,
Caria, the Hellespont, the islands up to the Propontis itself; the coasts of Thrace, as far as
Thrace extends, and the bordering nations as far as the Danube. Which of these countries
retained its former look, unless any were already possessed with the evil? The people of
Cappadocia alone felt not these afflictions of the Church, because our mighty champion
saved them in their trial.</p>
<p>Such was the achievement of this ‘coward’ master of ours; such was the success of one
who ‘shirks all sterner toil.’ Surely it is not that of one who ‘wins renown amongst poor old
women, and practises to deceive the sex which naturally falls into every snare,’ and ‘thinks
it a great thing to be admired by the criminal and abandoned;’ it is that of one who has
proved by deeds his soul’s fortitude, and the unflinching and noble manliness of his spirit.
His success has resulted in the salvation of the whole country, the peace of our Church, the
pattern given to the virtuous of every excellence, the overthrow of the foe, the upholding of
the Faith, the confirmation of the weaker brethren, the encouragement of the zealous,
everything that is believed to belong to the victorious side; and in the commemoration of

<head>§13. Résumé of his dogmatic teaching. Objections to it in detail.</head>
<p>But somehow our discourse has swerved considerably from the mark; it has had to turn
round and face each of this slanderer’s insults. To Eunomius indeed it is no small advantage
that the discussion should linger upon such points, and that the indictment of his offences
against man should delay our approach to his graver sins. But it is profitless to abuse for
hastiness of speech one who is on his trial for murder; (because the proof of the latter is
sufficient to get the verdict of death passed, even though hastiness of speech is not proved
along with it); just so it seems best to subject to proof his blasphemy only, and to leave his
insults alone. When his heinousness on the most important points has been detected, his
other delinquencies are proved potentially without going minutely into them. Well then; at
the head of all his argumentations stands this blasphemy against the definitions of the
Faith—both in his former work and in that which we are now criticizing—and his strenuous
effort to destroy and cancel and completely upset all devout conceptions as to the Only-
Begotten Son of God and the Holy Spirit. To show, then, how false and inconsistent are his
arguments against these doctrines of the truth, I will first quote word for word his whole
statement, and then I will begin again and examine each portion separately. “The whole
account of our doctrines is summed up thus; there is the Supreme and Absolute Being, and
another Being existing by reason of the First, but after It104 though before all others; and a
third Being not ranking with either of these, but inferior to the one, as to its cause, to the
other, as to the energy which produced it: there must of course be included in this account
<note type="footnote">104 there is the Supreme and Absolute Being, and another Being existing through the First, but after It. The
language of this exposition of Eunomius is Aristotelian: but the contents nevertheless are nothing more nor less
than Gnosticism, as Rupp well points out (Gregors v. Nyssa Leben und Meinungen, p. 132 sq.). Arianism, he
says, is nothing but the last attempt of Gnosticism to force the doctrine of emanations into Christian theology,
clothing that doctrine on this occasion in a Greek dress. It was still an oriental heresy, not a Greek heresy like
Pelagianism in the next century. Rupp gives two reasons why Arianism may be identified with Gnosticism. 1.
Arianism holds the Λόγος as the highest being after the Godhead, i.e. as the πρωτότοκος τῆς κτίσεως, and as
merely the mediator between God and Man: just as it was the peculiar aim of Gnosticism to bridge over the gulf
between the Creator and the Created by means of intermediate beings (the emanations). 2. Eunomius and his
master adopted that very system of Greek philosophy which had always been the natural ally of Gnosticism: i.e.
Aristotle is strong in divisions and differences, weak in ‘identifications:’ he had marked with a clearness never
attained before the various stages upwards of existencies in the physical world: and this is just what Gnosticism,
in its wish to exhibit all things according to their relative distances from the ᾽Αγέννητος, wanted. Eunomius has
in fact in this formula of his translated all the terms of Scripture straight into those of Aristotle: he has changed the ethical-
physical of Christianity into the purely physical; πνεύμα e.g. becomes οὐσία: and by thus banishing the spiritual and
the moral he has made his ᾽Αγέννητος as completely ‘single’ and incommunicable as the τὸ πρῶτον κίνουν ἀκίνητον
(Arist. Metaph. XII. 7).</note>

the energies that follow each Being, and the names germane to these energies. Again, as
each Being is absolutely single, and is in fact and thought one, and its energies are bounded
by its works, and its works commensurate with its energies, necessarily, of course, the energies
which follow these Beings are relatively greater and less, some being of a higher, some of a
lower order; in a word, their difference amounts to that existing between their works: it
would in fact not be lawful to say that the same energy produced the angels or stars, and
the heavens or man: but a pious mind would conclude that in proportion as some works
are superior to and more honourable than others, so does one energy transcend another,
because sameness of energy produces sameness of work, and difference of work indicates
difference of energy. These things being so, and maintaining an unbroken connexion in
their relation to each other, it seems fitting for those who make their investigation according
to the order germane to the subject, and who do not insist on mixing and confusing all together,
in case of a discussion being raised about Being, to prove what is in course of
demonstration, and to settle the points in debate, by the primary energies and those attached
to the Beings, and again to explain by the Beings when the energies are in question, yet still
to consider the passage from the first to the second the more suitable and in all respects the
more efficacious of the two.”</p>
<p>Such is his blasphemy systematized! May the Very God, Son of the Very God, by the
leading of the Holy Spirit, direct our discussion to the truth! We will repeat his statements
one by one. He asserts that the “whole account of his doctrines is summed up in the Supreme
and Absolute Being, and in another Being existing by reason of the First, but after It though
before all others, and in a third Being not ranking with either of these but inferior to the
one as to its cause, to the other as to the energy.” The first point, then, of the unfair dealings
in this statement to be noticed is that in professing to expound the mystery of the Faith, he
corrects as it were the expressions in the Gospel, and will not make use of the words by
which our Lord in perfecting our faith conveyed that mystery to us: he suppresses the names
of ‘Father, Son and Holy Ghost,’ and speaks of a ‘Supreme and Absolute Being’ instead of
the Father, of ‘another existing through it, but after it’ instead of the Son, and of ‘a third
ranking with neither of these two’ instead of the Holy Ghost. And yet if those had been the
more appropriate names, the Truth Himself would not have been at a loss to discover them,
nor those men either, on whom successively devolved the preaching of the mystery,
whether they were from the first eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word, or, as successors
to these, filled the whole world with the Evangelical doctrines, and again at various periods
after this defined in a common assembly the ambiguities raised about the doctrine; whose
traditions are constantly preserved in writing in the churches. If those had been the appropriate
terms, they would not have mentioned, as they did, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
granting indeed it were pious or safe to remodel at all, with a view to this innovation, the
terms of the faith; or else they were all ignorant men and uninstructed in the mysteries, and

<pb n="95"/>
unacquainted with what he calls the appropriate names—those men who had really neither
the knowledge nor the desire to give the preference to their own conceptions over what had
been handed down to us by the voice of God.</p>

<head>§14. He did wrong, when mentioning the Doctrines of Salvation, in adopting terms of his own
choosing instead of the traditional terms Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</head>
<p>The reason for this invention of new words I take to be manifest to every one—namely:
that every one, when the words father and son are spoken, at once recognizes the proper
and natural relationship to one another which they imply. This relationship is conveyed at
once by the appellations themselves. To prevent it being understood of the Father, and the
Only-begotten Son, he robs us of this idea of relationship which enters the ear along with
the words, and abandoning the inspired terms, expounds the Faith by means of others devised
to injure the truth.</p>
<p>One thing, however, that he says is true: that his own teaching, not the Catholic teaching,
is summed up so. Indeed any one who reflects can easily see the impiety of his statement.
It will not be out of place now to discuss in detail what his intention is in ascribing to the
being of the Father alone the highest degree of that which is supreme and proper, while not
admitting that the being of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is supreme and proper. For my
part I think that it is a prelude to his complete denial of the ‘being’ of the Only-begotten
and of the Holy Ghost, and that this system of his is secretly intended to effect the setting
aside of all real belief in their personality, while in appearance and in mere words confessing
it. A moment’s reflection upon his statement will enable any one to perceive that this is so.
It does not look like one who thinks that the Only-begotten and the Holy Ghost really exist
in a distinct personality to be very particular about the names with which he thinks the
greatness of Almighty God should be expressed. To grant the fact105, and then go into
minute distinctions about the appropriate phrases106 would be indeed consummate folly:
and so in ascribing a being that is in the highest degree supreme and proper only to the
Father, he makes us surmise by this silence respecting the other two that (to him) they do
not properly exist. How can that to which a proper being is denied be said to really exist?
When we deny proper being to it, we must perforce affirm of it all the opposite terms. That
which cannot be properly said is improperly said, so that the demonstration of its not being
properly said is a proof of its not really subsisting: and it is at this that Eunomius seems to
aim in introducing these new names into his teaching. For no one can say that he has strayed
from ignorance into some silly fancy of separating, locally, the supreme from that which is
below, and assigning to the Father as it were the peak of some hill, while he seats the Son
lower down in the hollows. No one is so childish as to conceive of differences in space, when
the intellectual and spiritual is under discussion. Local position is a property of the material:
but the intellectual and immaterial is confessedly removed from the idea of locality. What,
then, is the reason why he says that the Father alone has supreme being? For one can hardly
<note type="footnote">105 i.e. of the equality of Persons.</note>
<note type="footnote">106 i.e. for the Persons.</note>

<pb n="97"/>
think it is from ignorance that he wanders off into these conceptions, being one who, in the
many displays he makes, claims to be wise, even “making himself overwise,” as the Holy
Scripture forbids us to do107.</p>

<head>§15. He does wrong in making the being of the Father alone proper and supreme, implying
by his omission of the Son and the Spirit that theirs is improperly spoken of, and is inferior.</head>
<p>But at all events he will allow that this supremacy of being betokens no excess of power,
or of goodness, or of anything of that kind. Every one knows that, not to mention those
whose knowledge is supposed to be very profound; viz., that the personality of the Onlybegotten
and of the Holy Ghost has nothing lacking in the way of perfect goodness, perfect
power, and of every quality like that. Good, as long as it is incapable of its opposite, has no
bounds to its goodness: its opposite alone can circumscribe it, as we may see by particular
examples. Strength is stopped only when weakness seizes it; life is limited by death alone;
darkness is the ending of light: in a word, every good is checked by its opposite, and by that
alone. If then he supposes that the nature of the Only-begotten and of the Spirit can change
for the worse, then he plainly diminishes the conception of their goodness, making them
capable of being associated with their opposites. But if the Divine and unalterable nature is
incapable of degeneracy, as even our foes allow, we must regard it as absolutely unlimited
in its goodness: and the unlimited is the same as the infinite. But to suppose excess and defect
in the infinite and unlimited is to the last degree unreasonable: for how can the idea of infinitude
remain, if we posited increase and loss in it? We get the idea of excess only by a
comparison of limits: where there is no limit, we cannot think of any excess. Perhaps, however,
this was not what he was driving at, but he assigns this superiority only by the
prerogative of priority in time, and, with this idea only, declares the Father’s being to be
alone the supreme one. Then he must tell us on what grounds he has measured out more
length of life to the Father, while no distinctions of time whatever have been previously
conceived of in the personality of the Son.</p>
<p>And yet supposing for a moment, for the sake of argument, that this was so, what superiority
does the being which is prior in time have over that which follows, on the score
of pure being, that he can say that the one is supreme and proper, and the other is not? For
while the lifetime of the elder as compared with the younger is longer, yet his being has
neither increase nor decrease on that account. This will be clear by an illustration. What
disadvantage, on the score of being, as compared with Abraham, had David who lived
fourteen generations after? Was any change, so far as humanity goes, effected in the latter?
Was he less a human being, because he was later in time? Who would be so foolish as to
assert this? The definition of their being is the same for both: the lapse of time does not
change it. No one would assert that the one was more a man for being first in time, and the
other less because he sojourned in life later; as if humanity had been exhausted on the first,
or as if time had spent its chief power upon the deceased. For it is not in the power of time
to define for each one the measures of nature, but nature abides self-contained, preserving
herself through succeeding generations: and time has a course of its own, whether surrounding,
or flowing by, this nature, which remains firm and motionless within her own limits.

<pb n="99"/>
Therefore, not even supposing, as our argument did for a moment, that an advantage were
allowed on the score of time, can they properly ascribe to the Father alone the highest supremacy
of being: but as there is really no difference whatever in the prerogative of time,
how could any one possibly entertain such an idea about these existencies which are pretemporal?
Every measure of distance that we could discover is beneath the divine nature:
so no ground is left for those who attempt to divide this pre-temporal and incomprehensible
being by distinctions of superior and inferior.</p>
<p>We have no hesitation either in asserting that what is dogmatically taught by them is
an advocacy of the Jewish doctrine, setting forth, as they do, that the being of the Father
alone has subsistence, and insisting that this only has proper existence, and reckoning that
of the Son and the Spirit among non-existencies, seeing that what does not properly exist
can be said nominally only, and by an abuse of terms, to exist at all. The name of man, for
instance, is not given to a portrait representing one, but to so and so who is absolutely such,
the original of the picture, and not the picture itself; whereas the picture is in word only a
man, and does not possess absolutely the quality ascribed to it, because it is not in its nature
that which it is called. In the case before us, too, if being is properly ascribed to the Father,
but ceases when we come to the Son and the Spirit, it is nothing short of a plain denial of
the message of salvation. Let them leave the church and fall back upon the synagogues of
the Jews, proving, as they do, the Son’s non-existence in denying to Him proper being. What
does not properly exist is the same thing as the non-existent.</p>
<p>Again, he means in all this to be very clever, and has a poor opinion of those who essay
to write without logical force. Then let him tell us, contemptible though we are, by what
sort of skill he has detected a greater and a less in pure being. What is his method for establishing
that one being is more of a being than another being,—taking being in its plainest
meaning, for he must not bring forward those various qualities and properties, which are
comprehended in the conception of the being, and gather round it, but are not the subject
itself? Shade, colour, weight, force or reputation, distinctive manner, disposition, any quality
thought of in connection with body or mind, are not to be considered here: we have to inquire
only whether the actual subject of all these, which is termed absolutely the being, differs in
degree of being from another. We have yet to learn that of two known existencies, which
still exist, the one is more, the other less, an existence. Both are equally such, as long as they
are in the category of existence, and when all notions of more or less value, more or less
force, have been excluded.</p>
<p>If, then, he denies that we can regard the Only-begotten as completely existing,—for to
this depth his statement seems to lead,—in withholding from Him a proper existence, let
him deny it even in a less degree. If, however, he does grant that the Son subsists in some
substantial way—we will not quarrel now about the particular way—why does he take away
again that which he has conceded Him to be, and prove Him to exist not properly, which

<pb n="100"/>
is tantamount, as we have said, to not at all? For as humanity is not possible to that which
does not possess the complete connotation of the term ‘man,’ and the whole conception of
it is cancelled in the case of one who lacks any of the properties, so in every thing whose
complete and proper existence is denied, the partial affirmation of its existence is no proof
of its subsisting at all; the demonstration, in fact, of its incomplete being is a demonstration
of its effacement in all points. So that if he is well-advised, he will come over to the orthodox
belief, and remove from his teaching the idea of less and of incompleteness in the nature of
the Son and the Spirit: but if he is determined to blaspheme, and wishes for some inscrutable
reason thus to requite his Maker and God and Benefactor, let him at all events part with his
conceit of possessing some amount of showy learning, unphilosophically piling, as he does,
being over being, one above the other, one proper, one not such, for no discoverable reason.
We have never heard that any of the infidel philosophers have committed this folly, any
more than we have met with it in the inspired writings, or in the common apprehension of
mankind.</p>
<p>I think that from what has been said it will be clear what is the aim of these newly-devised
names. He drops them as the base of operations or foundation-stone of all this work of
mischief to the Faith: once he can get the idea into currency that the one Being alone is supreme
and proper in the highest degree, he can then assail the other two, as belonging to
the inferior and not regarded as properly Being. He shows this especially in what follows,
where he is discussing the belief in the Son and the Holy Spirit, and does not proceed with
these names, so as to avoid bringing before us the proper characteristic of their nature by
means of those appellations: they are passed over unnoticed by this man who is always
telling us that minds of the hearers are to be directed by the use of appropriate names and
phrases. Yet what name could be more appropriate than that which has been given by the
Very Truth? He sets his views against the Gospel, and names not the Son, but ‘a Being existing
through the First, but after It though before all others.’ That this is said to destroy the right
faith in the Only-begotten will be made plainer still by his subsequent arguments. Still there
is only a moderate amount of mischief in these words: one intending no impiety at all towards
Christ might sometimes use them: we will therefore omit at present all discussion about our
Lord, and reserve our reply to the more open blasphemies against Him. But on the subject
of the Holy Spirit the blasphemy is plain and unconcealed: he says that He is not to be ranked
with the Father or the Son, but is subject to both. I will therefore examine as closely as possible
this statement.</p>

<head>§16. Examination of the meaning of ‘subjection:’ in that he says that the nature of the Holy
Spirit is subject to that of the Father and the Son. It is shewn that the Holy Spirit is of an
equal, not inferior, rank to the Father and the Son.</head>
<p>Let us first, then, ascertain the meaning of this word ‘subjection’ in Scripture. To whom
is it applied? The Creator, honouring man in his having been made in His own image, ‘hath
placed’ the brute creation ‘in subjection under his feet;’ as great David relating this favour
(of God) exclaimed in the Psalms108: “He put all things,” he says, “under his feet,” and he
mentions by name the creatures so subjected. There is still another meaning of ‘subjection’
in Scripture. Ascribing to God Himself the cause of his success in war, the Psalmist says109,
“He hath put peoples and nations in subjection under our feet,” and “He that putteth peoples
in subjection under me.” This word is often found thus in Scripture, indicating a victory.
As for the future subjection of all men to the Only-begotten, and through Him to the Father,
in the passage where the Apostle with a profound wisdom speaks of the Mediator between
God and man as subject to the Father, implying by that subjection of the Son who shares
humanity the actual subjugation of mankind—we will not discuss it now, for it requires a
full and thorough examination. But to take only the plain and unambiguous meaning of
the word subjection, how can he declare the being of the Spirit to be subject to that of the
Son and the Father? As the Son is subject to the Father, according to the thought of the
Apostle? But in this view the Spirit is to be ranked with the Son, not below Him, seeing that
both Persons are of this lower rank. This was not his meaning? How then? In the way the
brute creation is subject to the rational, as in the Psalm? There is then as great a difference
as is implied in the subjection of the brute creation, when compared to man. Perhaps he
will reject this explanation as well. Then he will have to come to the only remaining one,
that the Spirit, at first in the rebellious ranks, was afterwards forced by a superior Force to
bend to a Conqueror.</p>
<p>Let him choose which he likes of these alternatives: whichever it is I do not see how he
can avoid the inevitable crime of blasphemy: whether he says the Spirit is subject in the
manner of the brute creation, as fish and birds and sheep, to man, or were to fetch Him a
captive to a superior power after the manner of a rebel. Or does he mean neither of these
ways, but uses the word in a different signification altogether to the scripture meaning?
What, then, is that signification? Does he lay down that we must rank Him as inferior and
not as equal, because He was given by our Lord to His disciples third in order? By the same
reasoning he should make the Father inferior to the Son, since the Scripture often places
the name of our Lord first, and the Father Almighty second. “I and My Father,” our Lord
<note type="footnote">108 Psalm viii. 6–8.</note>
<note type="footnote">109 Psalm xlvii. 3 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="102"/>
says. “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God110,” and other passages innumerable
which the diligent student of Scripture testimonies might collect: for instance,
“there are differences of gifts, but it is the same Spirit: and there are differences of administration,
but it is the same Lord: and there are differences of operations, but it is the same
God.” According to this, then, let the Almighty Father, who is mentioned third, be made
‘subject’ to the Son and the Spirit. However we have never yet heard of a philosophy such
as this, which relegates to the category of the inferior and the dependent that which is
mentioned second or third only for some particular reason of sequence: yet that is what our
author wants to do, in arguing to show that the order observed in the transmission of the
Persons amounts to differences of more and less in dignity and nature. In fact he rules that
sequence in point of order is indicative of unlikeness of nature: whence he got this fancy,
what necessity compelled him to it, is not clear. Mere numerical rank does not create a different
nature: that which we would count in a number remains the same in nature whether
we count it or not. Number is a mark only of the mere quantity of things: it does not place
second those things only which have an inferior natural value, but it makes the sequence of
the numerical objects indicated in accordance with the intention of those who are counting.
‘Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus’ are three persons mentioned according to a particular
intention. Does the place of Silvanus, second and after Paul, indicate that he was other than
a man? Or is Timothy, because he is third, considered by the writer who so ranks him a
different kind of being? Not so. Each is human both before and after this arrangement.
Speech, which cannot utter the names of all three at once, mentions each separately according
to an order which commends itself, but unites them by the copula, in order that the juncture
of the names may show the harmonious action of the three towards one end.</p>
<p>This, however, does not please our new dogmatist. He opposes the arrangement of
Scripture. He separates off that equality with the Father and the Son of His proper and natural
rank and connexion which our Lord Himself pronounces, and numbers Him with
‘subjects’: he declares Him to be a work of both Persons111, of the Father, as supplying the
<note type="footnote">110 John x. 30; 2 Cor. xiii. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">111 he declares Him to be a work of both Persons. With regard to Gregory’s own belief as to the procession of
the Holy Spirit, it may be said once for all that there is hardly anything (but see p. 99, note 5) clear about it to
be found in his writings. The question, in fact, remained undecided until the 9th century, the time of the schism
of the East and West. But here, as in other points, Origen had approached the nearest to the teaching of the
West: for he represents the procession as from Father and Son, just as often as from one Person or the other.
Athanasius does certainly say that the Spirit ‘unites the creation to the Son, and through the Son to the Father,’
but with him this expression is not followed up: while in the Roman Church it led to doctrine. For why does
the Holy Spirit unite the creation with God continuously and perfectly? Because, to use Bossuet’s words, “proceeding
from the Father and the Son He is their love and eternal union.” Neither Basil, nor Gregory Nazianzen,
nor Chrysostom, have anything definite about the procession of the Third Person.</note>

cause of His constitution, of the Only-begotten, as of the artificer of His subsistence: and
defines this as the ground of His ‘subjection,’ without as yet unfolding the meaning of
‘subjection.’</p>

<pb n="104"/>
<head>§17. Discussion as to the exact nature of the ‘energies’ which, this man declares, ‘follow’ the
being of the Father and of the Son.</head>
<p>Then he says “there must of course be included in this account the energies that accompany
each Being, and the names appropriate to these energies.” Shrouded in such a mist of
vagueness, the meaning of this is far from clear: but one might conjecture it is as follows.
By the energies of the Beings, he means those powers which have produced the Son and the
Holy Spirit, and by which the First Being made the Second, and the Second the Third: and
he means that the names of the results produced have been provided in a manner appropriate
to those results. We have already exposed the mischief of these names, and will again, when
we return to that part of the question, should additional discussion of it be required.</p>
<p>But it is worth a moment’s while now to consider how energies ‘follow’ beings: what
these energies are essentially: whether different to the beings which they ‘follow,’ or part of
them, and of their inmost nature: and then, if different, how and whence they arise: if the
same, how they have got cut off from them, and instead of co-existing ‘follow’ them externally
only. This is necessary, for we cannot learn all at once from his words whether some natural
necessity compels the ‘energy,’ whatever that may be, to ‘follow’ the being, the way heat and
vapour follow fire, and the various exhalations the bodies which produce them. Still I do
not think that he would affirm that we should consider the being of God to be something
heterogeneous and composite, having the energy inalienably contained in the idea of itself,
like an ‘accident’ in some subject-matter: he must mean that the beings, deliberately and
voluntarily moved, produce by themselves the desired result. But, if this be so, who would
style this free result of intention as one of its external consequences? We have never heard
of such an expression used in common parlance in such cases; the energy of the worker of
anything is not said to ‘follow’ that worker. We cannot separate one from the other and
leave one behind by itself: but, when one mentions the energy, one comprehends in the idea
that which is moved with the energy, and when one mentions the worker one implies at
once the unmentioned energy.</p>
<p>An illustration will make our meaning clearer. We say a man works in iron, or in wood,
or in anything else. This single expression conveys at once the idea of the working and of
the artificer, so that if we withdraw the one, the other has no existence. If then they are thus
thought of together, i.e. the energy and he who exercises it, how in this case can there be
said to “follow” upon the first being the energy which produces the second being, like a sort
of go-between to both, and neither coalescing with the nature of the first, nor combining
with the second: separated from the first because it is not its very nature, but only the exercise
of its nature, and from that which results afterwards because it does not therein reproduce
a mere energy, but an active being.</p>

<pb n="105"/>
<head>§18. He has no reason for distinguishing a plurality of beings in the Trinity. He offers no
demonstration that it is so.</head>
<p>Let us examine the following as well. He calls one Being the work of another, the second
of the first, and the third of the second. On what previous demonstration does this statement
rest: what proofs does he make use of, what method, to compel belief in the succeeding Being
as a result of the preceding? For even if it were possible to draw an analogy for this from
created things, such conjecturing about the transcendent from lower existences would not
be altogether sound, though the error in arguing from natural phenomena to the incomprehensible
might then be pardonable. But as it is, none would venture to affirm that, while
the heavens are the work of God, the sun is that of the heavens, and the moon that of the
sun, and the stars that of the moon, and other created things that of the stars: seeing that
all are the work of One: for there is one God and Father of all, of Whom are all things. If
anything is produced by mutual transmission, such as the race of animals, not even here
does one produce another, for nature runs on through each generation. How then, when it
is impossible to affirm it of the created world, can he declare of the transcendent existencies
that the second is a work of the first, and so on? If, however, he is thinking of animal generation,
and fancies that such a process is going on also amongst pure existences, so that the
older produces the younger, even so he fails to be consistent: for such productions are of
the same type as their progenitors: whereas he assigns to the members of his succession
strange and uninherited qualities: and thus displays a superfluity of falsehood, while striving
to strike truth with both hands at once, in a clever boxer’s fashion. In order to show the inferior
rank and diminution in intrinsic value of the Son and Holy Spirit, he declares that
“one is produced from another;” in order that those who understand about mutual generation
might entertain no idea of family relationship here: he contradicts the law of nature by declaring
that “one is produced from another,” and at the same time exhibiting the Son as a
bastard when compared with His Father’s nature.</p>
<p>But one might find fault with him, I think, before coming to all this. If, that is, any one
else, previously unaccustomed to discussion and unversed in logical expression, delivered
his ideas in this chance fashion, some indulgence might be shown him for not using the recognized
methods for establishing his views. But considering that Eunomius has such an
abundance of this power, that he can advance by his ‘irresistible’ method112 of proof even

into the supra-natural, how can he be ignorant of the starting-point from which this ‘irresistible’
perception of a hidden truth takes its rise in all these logical excursions. Every one
knows that all such arguing must start from plain and well-known truths, to compel belief
through itself in still doubtful truths: and that none of these last can be grasped without the
guidance of what is obvious leading us towards the unknown. If on the other hand that
which is adopted to start with for the illustration of this unknown is at variance with universal
belief, it will be a long time before the unknown will receive any illustration from it.</p>
<p>The whole controversy, then, between the Church and the Anomoeans turns on this:
Are we to regard the Son and the Holy Spirit as belonging to created or uncreated existence?
Our opponent declares that to be the case which all deny: he boldly lays it down, without
looking about for any proof, that each being is the work of the preceding being. What
method of education, what school of thought can warrant him in this, it is difficult to see.
Some axiom that cannot be denied or assailed must be the beginning of every process of
proof; so as for the unknown quantity to be demonstrated from what has been assumed,
being legitimately deduced by intervening syllogisms. The reasoner, therefore, who makes
what ought to be the object of inquiry itself a premiss of his demonstration is only proving
the obscure by the obscure, and illusion by illusion. He is making ‘the blind lead the blind,’
for it is a truly blind and unsupported statement to say that the Creator and Maker of all
things is a creature made: and to this they link on a conclusion that is also blind: namely,
that the Son is alien in nature, unlike in being to the Father, and quite devoid of His essential
character. But of this enough. Where his thought is nakedly blasphemous, there we too can
defer its refutation. We must now return to consider his words which come next in order.</p>

The test of irresistibility (κατάληψις) was, in the first place, understood to apply to sensations from without,
such sensations, according to the Stoic view, alone supplying the material for knowledge. An equal degree of
certainty was, however, attached to terms deduced from originally true data, either by the universal and natural
exercise of thought, or by scientific processes of proof. It is καταλέψεις obtained in this last way that Gregory
refers to, and Eunomius was endeavouring to create in the supra-natural world.</note>

<head>§19. His acknowledgment that the Divine Being is ‘single’ is only verbal.</head>
<p>“Each Being has, in fact and in conception, a nature unmixed, single, and absolutely
one as estimated by its dignity; and as the works are bounded by the energies of each operator,
and the energies by the works, it is inevitable that the energies which follow each Being
are greater in the one case than the other, some being of the first, others of the second rank.”
The intention that runs through all this, however verbosely expressed, is one and the same;
namely, to establish that there is no connexion between the Father and the Son, or between
the Son and the Holy Ghost, but that these Beings are sundered from each other, and possess
natures foreign and unfamiliar to each other, and differ not only in that, but also in magnitude
and in subordination of their dignities, so that we must think of one as greater than the
other, and presenting every other sort of difference.</p>
<p>It may seem to many useless to linger over what is so obvious, and to attempt a discussion
of that which to them is on the face of it false and abominable and groundless: nevertheless,
to avoid even the appearance of having to let these statements pass for want of counter-arguments,
we will meet them with all our might. He says, “each being amongst them is unmixed,
single, and absolutely one, as estimated by its dignity, both in fact and in conception.”
Then premising this very doubtful statement as an axiom and valuing his own ‘ipse dixit’
as a sufficient substitute for any proof, he thinks he has made a point. “There are three Beings:”
for he implies this when he says, ‘each being amongst them:’ he would not have used
these words, if he meant only one. Now if he speaks thus of the mutual difference between
the Beings in order to avoid complicity with the heresy of Sabellius, who applied three titles
to one subject, we would acquiesce in his statement: nor would any of the Faithful contradict
his view, except so far as he seems to be at fault in his names, and his mere form of expression
in speaking of ‘beings’ instead of ‘persons:’ for things that are identical on the score of being
will not all agree equally in definition on the score of personality. For instance, Peter, James,
and John are the same viewed as beings, each was a man: but in the characteristics of their
respective personalities, they were not alike. If, then, he were only proving that it is not right
to confound the Persons, and to fit all the three names on to one Subject, his ‘saying’ would
be, to use the Apostle’s words, ‘faithful, and worthy of all acceptation113.’ But this is not his
object: he speaks so, not because he divides the Persons only from each other by their recognized
characteristics, but because he makes the actual substantial being of each different
from that of the others, or rather from itself: and so he speaks of a plurality of beings with
distinctive differences which alienate them from each other. I therefore declare that his view
is unfounded, and lacks a principle: it starts from data that are not granted, and then it
<note type="footnote">113 1 Timothy i. 15.</note>

<pb n="108"/>
constructs by mere logic a blasphemy upon them. It attempts no demonstration that could
attract towards such a conception of the doctrine: it merely contains the statement of an
unproved impiety, as if it were telling us a dream. While the Church teaches that we must
not divide our faith amongst a plurality of beings, but must recognize no difference of being
in three Subjects or Persons, whereas our opponents posit a variety and unlikeness amongst
them as Beings, this writer confidently assumes as already proved what never has been, and
never can be, proved by argument: maybe he has not even yet found hearers for his talk: or
he might have been informed by one of them who was listening intelligently that every
statement which is made at random, and without proof, is ‘an old woman’s tale,’ and
powerless to prove the question, in itself, unaided by any plea whatever fetched from the
Scriptures, or from human reasonings. So much for this.</p>
<p>But let us still scrutinize his words. He declares each of these Beings, whom he has
shadowed forth in his exposition, to be single and absolutely one. We believe that the most
boorish and simple-minded would not deny that the Divine Nature, blessed and transcendent
as it is, was ‘single.’ That which is viewless, formless, and sizeless, cannot be conceived of
as multiform and composite. But it will be clear, upon the very slightest reflection, that this
view of the supreme Being as ‘simple,’ however finely they may talk of it, is quite inconsistent
with the system which they have elaborated. For who does not know that, to be exact, simplicity
in the case of the Holy Trinity admits of no degrees. In this case there is no mixture
or conflux of qualities to think of; we comprehend a potency without parts and composition;
how then, and on what grounds, could any one perceive there any differences of less and
more. For he who marks differences there must perforce think of an incidence of certain
qualities in the subject. He must in fact have perceived differences in largeness and smallness
therein, to have introduced this conception of quantity into the question: or he must posit
abundance or diminution in the matter of goodness, strength, wisdom, or of anything else
that can with reverence be associated with God: and neither way will he escape the idea of
composition. Nothing which possesses wisdom or power or any other good, not as an external
gift, but rooted in its nature, can suffer diminution in it; so that if any one says that
he detects Beings greater and smaller in the Divine Nature, he is unconsciously establishing
a composite and heterogeneous Deity, and thinking of the Subject as one thing, and the
quality, to share in which constitutes as good that which was not so before, as another. If
he had been thinking of a Being really single and absolutely one, identical with goodness
rather than possessing it, he would not be able to count a greater and a less in it at all. It was
said, moreover, above that good can be diminished by the presence of evil alone, and that
where the nature is incapable of deteriorating, there is no limit conceived of to the goodness:
the unlimited, in fact, is not such owing to any relation whatever, but, considered in itself,
escapes limitation. It is, indeed, difficult to see how a reflecting mind can conceive one infinite
to be greater or less than another infinite. So that if he acknowledges the supreme

<pb n="109"/>
Being to be ‘single’ and homogenous, let him grant that it is bound up with this universal
attribute of simplicity and infinitude. If, on the other hand, he divides and estranges the
‘Beings’ from each other, conceiving that of the Only-begotten as another than the Father’s,
and that of the Spirit as another than the Only-begotten, with a ‘more’ and ‘less’ in each
case, let him be exposed now as granting simplicity in appearance only to the Deity, but in
reality proving the composite in Him.</p>
<p>But let us resume the examination of his words in order. “Each Being has in fact and
conception a nature unmixed, single, and absolutely one, as estimated by its dignity.” Why
“as estimated by its dignity?” If he contemplates the Beings in their common dignity, this
addition is unnecessary and superfluous, and dwells upon that which is obvious: although
a word so out of place might be pardoned, if it was any feeling of reverence which prompted
him not to reject it. But here the mischief really is not owing to a mistake about a phrase
(that might be easily set right): but it is connected with his evil designs. He says that each
of the three beings is ‘single, as estimated by its dignity,’ in order that, on the strength of his
previous definitions of the first, second, and third Being, the idea of their simplicity also
may be marred. Having affirmed that the being of the Father alone is ‘Supreme’ and ‘Proper,’
and having refused both these titles to that of the Son and of the Spirit, in accordance with
this, when he comes to speak of them all as ‘simple,’ he thinks it his duty to associate with
them the idea of simplicity in proportion only to their essential worth, so that the Supreme
alone is to be conceived of as at the height and perfection of simplicity, while the second,
in proportion to its declension from supremacy, receives also a diminished measure of
simplicity, and in the case of the third Being also, there is as much variation from the perfect
simplicity, as the amount of worth is lessened in the extremes: whence it results that the
Father’s being is conceived as of pure simplicity, that of the Son as not so flawless in simplicity,
but with a mixture of the composite, that of the Holy Spirit as still increasing in the
composite, while the amount of simplicity is gradually lessened. Just as imperfect goodness
must be owned to share in some measure in the reverse disposition, so imperfect simplicity
cannot escape being considered composite.</p>

<head>§20. He does wrong in assuming, to account for the existence of the Only-Begotten, an ‘energy’
that produced Christ’s Person.</head>
<p>That such is his intention in using these phrases will be clear from what follows, where
he more plainly materializes and degrades our conception of the Son and of the Spirit. “As
the energies are bounded by the works, and the works commensurate with the energies, it
necessarily follows that these energies which accompany these Beings are relatively greater
and less, some being of a higher, some of a lower order.” Though he has studiously wrapt
the mist of his phraseology round the meaning of this, and made it hard for most to find
out, yet as following that which we have already examined it will easily be made clear. “The
energies,” he says, “are bounded by the works.” By ‘works’ he means the Son and the Spirit,
by ‘energies’ the efficient powers by which they were produced, which powers, he said a
little above, ‘follow’ the Beings. The phrase ‘bounded by’ expresses the balance which exists
between the being produced and the producing power, or rather the ‘energy’ of that power,
to use his own word implying that the thing produced is not the effect of the whole power
of the operator, but only of a particular energy of it, only so much of the whole power being
exerted as is calculated to be likely to be equal to effect that result. Then he inverts his
statement: “and the works are commensurate with the energies of the operators.” The
meaning of this will be made clearer by an illustration. Let us think of one of the tools of a
shoemaker: i.e., a leather-cutter. When it is moved round upon that from which a certain
shape has to be cut, the part so excised is limited by the size of the instrument, and a circle
of such a radius will be cut as the instrument possesses of length, and, to put the matter the
other way, the span of the instrument will measure and cut out a corresponding circle. That
is the idea which our theologian has of the divine person of the Only-begotten. He declares
that a certain ‘energy’ which ‘follows’ upon the first Being produced, in the fashion of such
a tool, a corresponding work, namely our Lord: this is his way of glorifying the Son of God,
Who is even now glorified in the glory of the Father, and shall be revealed in the Day of
Judgment. He is a ‘work commensurate with the producing energy.’ But what is this energy
which ‘follows’ the Almighty and is to be conceived of prior to the Only-begotten, and which
circumscribes His being? A certain essential Power, self-subsisting, which works its will by
a spontaneous impulse. It is this, then, that is the real Father of our Lord. And why do we
go on talking of the Almighty as the Father, if it was not He, but an energy belonging to the
things which follow Him externally that produced the Son: and how can the Son be a son
any longer, when something else has given Him existence according to Eunomius, and He
creeps like a bastard (may our Lord pardon the expression!) into relationship with the
Father, and is to be honoured in name only as a Son? How can Eunomius rank our Lord
next after the Almighty at all, when he counts Him third only, with that mediating ‘energy’
placed in the second place? The Holy Spirit also according to this sequence will be found

<pb n="111"/>
not in the third, but in the fifth place, that ‘energy’ which follows the Only-Begotten, and
by which the Holy Spirit came into existence necessarily intervening between them.</p>
<p>Thereby, too, the creation of all things by the Son114 will be found to have no foundation:
another personality, prior to Him, has been invented by our neologian, to which the authorship
of the world must be referred, because the Son Himself derives His being according to
them from that ‘energy.’ If, however, to avoid such profanities, he makes this ‘energy’ which
produced the Son into something unsubstantial, he will have to explain to us how non-being
can ‘follow’ being, and how what is not a substance can produce a substance: for, if he did
that, we shall find an unreality following God, the non-existent author of all existence, the
radically unsubstantial circumscribing a substantial nature, the operative force of creation
contained, in the last resort, in the unreal. Such is the result of the teaching of this theologian
who affirms of the Lord Artificer of heaven and earth and of all the Creation, the Word of
God Who was in the beginning, through Whom are all things, that He owes His existence
to such a baseless entity or conception as that unnameable ‘energy’ which he has just invented,
and that He is circumscribed by it, as by an enclosing prison of unreality. He who ‘gazes
into the unseen’ cannot see the conclusion to which his teaching tends. It is this: if this ‘energy’
of God has no real existence, and if the work that this unreality produces is also circumscribed
by it, it is quite clear that we can only think of such a nature in the work, as that
which is possessed by this fancied producer of the work: in fact, that which is produced
from and is contained by an unreality can itself be conceived of as nothing else but a nonentity.
Opposites, in the nature of things, cannot be contained by opposites: such as water
by fire, life by death, light by darkness, being by non-being. But with all his excessive cleverness
he does not see this: or else he consciously shuts his eyes to the truth.</p>
<p>Some necessity compels him to see a diminution in the Son, and to establish a further
advance in this direction in the case of the Holy Ghost. “It necessarily follows,” he says, “that
these energies which accompany these Beings are relatively greater and less.” This compelling
necessity in the Divine nature, which assigns a greater and a less, has not been explained to
us by Eunomius, nor as yet can we ourselves understand it. Hitherto there has prevailed
with those who accept the Gospel in its plain simplicity the belief that there is no necessity
above the Godhead to bend the Only-begotten, like a slave, to inferiority. But he quite
overlooks this belief, though it was worth some consideration; and he dogmatizes that we
must conceive of this inferiority. But this necessity of his does not stop there: it lands him
still further in blasphemy: as our examination in detail has already shewn. If, that is, the Son
was born, not from the Father, but from some unsubstantial ‘energy,’ He must be thought
of as not merely inferior to the Father, and this doctrine must end in pure Judaism. This
<note type="footnote">114 There is of course reference here to John i. 3: and Eunomius is called just below the ‘new theologian,’
with an allusion of S. John, who was called by virtue of this passage essentially ὁ θεόλογος</note>

<pb n="112"/>
necessity, when followed out, exhibits the product of a non-entity as not merely insignificant,
but as something which it is a perilous blasphemy even for an accuser to name. For as that
which has its birth from an existence necessarily exists, so that which is evolved from the
non-existent necessarily does the very contrary. When anything is not self-existent, how
can it generate another?</p>
<p>If, then, this energy which ‘follows’ the Deity, and produces the Son, has no existence
of its own, no one can be so blind as not to see the conclusion, and that his aim is to deny
our Saviour’s deity: and if the personality of the Son is thus stolen by their doctrine from
the Faith, with nothing left of it but the name, it will be a long time before the Holy Ghost,
descended as He will be from a lineage of unrealities, will be believed in again. The energy
which ‘follows’ the Deity has no existence of its own: then common sense requires the
product of this to be unreal: then a second unsubstantial energy follows this product: then
it is declared that the Holy Ghost is formed by this energy: so that their blasphemy is plain
enough: it consists in nothing less than in denying that after the Ingenerate God there is
any real existence: and their doctrine advances into shadowy and unsubstantial fictions,
where there is no foundation of any actual subsistence. In such monstrous conclusions does
their teaching strand the argument.</p>

<head>§21. The blasphemy of these heretics is worse than the Jewish unbelief.</head>
<p>But let us assume that this is not so: for they allow, forsooth, in theoretic kindness towards
humanity, that the Only-begotten and the Holy Spirit have some personal existence: and if,
in allowing this, they had granted too the consequent conceptions about them, they would
not have been waging battle about the doctrine of the Church, nor cut themselves off from
the hope of Christians. But if they have lent an existence to the Son and the Spirit, only to
furnish a material on which to erect their blasphemy, perhaps it might have been better for
them, though it is a bold thing to say, to abjure the Faith and apostatize to the Jewish religion,
rather than to insult the name of Christian by this mock assent. The Jews at all events, though
they have persisted hitherto in rejecting the Word, carry their impiety only so far as to deny
that Christ has come, but to hope that He will come: we do not hear from them any malignant
or destructive conception of the glory of Him Whom they expect. But this school of the new
circumcision115, or rather of “the concision,” while they own that He has come, resemble
nevertheless those who insulted our Lord’s bodily presence by their wanton unbelief. They
wanted to stone our Lord: these men stone Him with their blasphemous titles. They urged
His humble and obscure origin, and rejected His divine birth before the ages: these men in
the same way deny His grand, sublime, ineffable generation from the Father, and would
prove that He owes His existence to a creation, just as the human race, and all that is born,
owe theirs. In the eyes of the Jews it was a crime that our Lord should be regarded as Son
of the Supreme: these men also are indignant against those who are sincere in making this
confession of Him. The Jews thought to honour the Almighty by excluding the Son from
equal reverence: these men, by annihilating the glory of the Son, think to bestow more
honour on the Father. But it would be difficult to do justice to the number and the nature
of the insults which they heap upon the Only-begotten: they invent an ‘energy’ prior to the
personality of the Son and say that He is its work and product: a thing which the Jews hitherto
have not dared to say. Then they circumscribe His nature, shutting Him off within certain
limits of the power which made Him: the amount of this productive energy is a sort of
measure within which they enclose Him: they have devised it as a sort of cloak to muffle
Him up in. We cannot charge the Jews with doing this.</p>
<note type="footnote">115 this school of the new circumcision. This accusation is somewhat discounted by Gregory’s comparison of
Eunomius elsewhere to Bardesanes and Marcion, to the Manichees, to Nicholaus, to Philo (see Book XI. 691,
704, VI. 607, and especially VII. 645), and by his putting him down a scholar of Plato. But a momentary advantage,
calculated in accordance with the character and capacities of the great mass of Gregory’s audience, could not
be lost. The lessons of Libanius, the rhetorician, had not been thrown away on Gregory.</note>

<head>§22. He has no right to assert a greater and less in the Divine being. A systematic statement
of the teaching of the Church.</head>
<p>Then they discover in His being a certain shortness in the way of deficiency, though
they do not tell us by what method they measure that which is devoid of quantity and size:
they are able to find out exactly by how much the size of the Only-begotten falls short of
perfection, and therefore has to be classed with the inferior and imperfect: much else they
lay down, partly by open assertion, partly by underhand inference: all the time making their
confession of the Son and the Spirit a mere exercise-ground for their unbelieving spirit.
How, then, can we fail to pity them more even than the condemned Jews, when views never
ventured upon by the latter are inferred by the former? He who makes the being of the Son
and of the Spirit comparatively less, seems, so far as words go perhaps, to commit but a
slight profanity: but if one were to test his view stringently it will be found the height of
blasphemy. Let us look into this, then, and let indulgence be shown me, if, for the sake of
doctrine, and to place in a clear light the lie which they have demonstrated, I advance into
an exposition of our own conception of the truth.</p>
<p>Now the ultimate division of all being is into the Intelligible and the Sensible. The
Sensible world is called by the Apostle broadly “that which is seen.” For as all body has colour,
and the sight apprehends this, he calls this world by the rough and ready name of “that
which is seen,” leaving out all the other qualities, which are essentially inherent in its
framework. The common term, again, for all the intellectual world, is with the Apostle “that
which is not seen116:” by withdrawing all idea of comprehension by the senses he leads the
mind on to the immaterial and intellectual. Reason again divides this “which is not seen”
into the uncreate and the created, inferentially comprehending it: the uncreate being that
which effects the Creation, the created that which owes its origin and its force to the uncreate.
In the Sensible world, then, is found everything that we comprehend by our organs of bodily
sense, and in which the differences of qualities involve the idea of more and less, such differences
consisting in quantity, quality, and the other properties.</p>
<p>But in the Intelligible world,—that part of it, I mean, which is created,—the idea of such
differences as are perceived in the Sensible cannot find a place: another method, then, is
devised for discovering the degrees of greater and less. The fountain, the origin, the supply
of every good is regarded as being in the world that is uncreate, and the whole creation inclines
to that, and touches and shares the Highest Existence only by virtue of its part in the
First Good: therefore it follows from this participation in the highest blessings varying in
degree according to the amount of freedom in the will that each possesses, that the greater
and less in this creation is disclosed according to the proportion of this tendency in each117.
<note type="footnote">116 Colossians i. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">117 i.e. according as each inclines more or less to the First Good.</note>

<pb n="115"/>
Created intelligible nature stands on the borderline between good and the reverse, so as to
be capable of either, and to incline at pleasure to the things of its choice, as we learn from
Scripture; so that we can say of it that it is more or less in the heights of excellence only in
proportion to its removal from the evil and its approach to the good. Whereas118 uncreate
intelligible nature is far removed from such distinctions: it does not possess the good by
acquisition, or participate only in the goodness of some good which lies above it: in its own
essence it is good, and is conceived as such: it is a source of good, it is simple, uniform, incomposite,
even by the confession of our adversaries. But it has distinction within itself in
keeping with the majesty of its own nature, but not conceived of with regard to quantity, as
Eunomius supposes: (indeed the man who introduces the notion of less of good into any of
the things believed to be in the Holy Trinity must admit thereby some admixture of the
opposite quality in that which fails of the good: and it is blasphemous to imagine this in the
case either of the Only-begotten, or of the Holy Spirit): we regard it as consummately perfect
and incomprehensibly excellent yet as containing clear distinctions within itself which reside
in the peculiarities of each of the Persons: as possessing invariableness by virtue of its common
attribute of uncreatedness, but differentiated by the unique character of each Person.
This peculiarity contemplated in each sharply and clearly divides one from the other: the
Father, for instance, is uncreate and ungenerate as well: He was never generated any more
than He was created. While this uncreatedness is common to Him and the Son, and the
Spirit, He is ungenerate as well as the Father. This is peculiar and uncommunicable, being
not seen in the other Persons. The Son in His uncreatedness touches the Father and the
Spirit, but as the Son and the Only-begotten He has a character which is not that of the
<note type="footnote">118 uncreate intelligible nature is far removed from such distinctions. This was the impregnable position that
Athanasius had taken up. To admit that the Son is less than the Father, and the Spirit less than the Son, is to
admit the law of emanation such as hitherto conceived, that is, the gradual and successive degradation of God’s
substance; which had conducted oriental heretics as well as the Neoplatonists to a sort of pantheistic polytheism.
Arius had indeed tried to resist this tendency so far as to bring back divinity to the Supreme Being; but it was
at the expense of the divinity of the Son, Who was with him just as much a created Intermediate between God
and man, as one of the Æons: and Aetius and Eunomius treated the Holy Ghost also as their master had treated
the Son. But Arianism tended at once to Judaism and, in making creatures adorable, to Greek polytheism. There
was only one way of cutting short the phantasmagoria of divine emanations, without having recourse to the
contradictory hypothesis of Arius: and that was to reject the law of emanation, as hitherto accepted, altogether.
Far from admitting that the Supreme Being is always weakening and degrading Himself in that which emanates
from Him, Athanasius lays down the principle that He produces within Himself nothing but what is perfect,
and first, and divine: and all that is not perfect is a work of the Divine Will, which draws it out of nothing (i.e.
creates it), and not out of the Divine Substance. This was the crowning result of the teaching of Alexandria and
Origen. See Denys (De la Philosophie d’Origene, p. 432, Paris, 1884).</note>

<pb n="116"/>
Almighty or of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit by the uncreatedness of His nature has
contact with the Son and Father, but is distinguished from them by His own tokens. His
most peculiar characteristic is that He is neither of those things which we contemplate in
the Father and the Son respectively. He is simply, neither as ungenerate119, nor as only-begotten:
this it is that constitutes His chief peculiarity. Joined to the Father by His uncreatedness,
He is disjoined from Him again by not being ‘Father.’ United to the Son by the bond
of uncreatedness, and of deriving His existence from the Supreme, He is parted again from
Him by the characteristic of not being the Only-begotten of the Father, and of having been
manifested by means of the Son Himself. Again, as the creation was effected by the Onlybegotten,
in order to secure that the Spirit should not be considered to have something in
common with this creation because of His having been manifested by means of the Son, He
is distinguished from it by His unchangeableness, and independence of all external goodness.
The creation does not possess in its nature this unchangeableness, as the Scripture says in
the description of the fall of the morning star, the mysteries on which subject are revealed
by our Lord to His disciples: “I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven120.” But the
very attributes which part Him from the creation constitute His relationship to the Father
and the Son. All that is incapable of degenerating has one and the same definition of “unchangeable.”</p>
<p>Having stated thus much as a preface we are in a position to discuss the rest of our adversaries’
teaching. “It necessarily follows,” he says in his system of the Son and the Spirit,
“that the Beings are relatively greater and less.” Let us then inquire what is the meaning of
this necessity of difference. Does it arise from a comparison formed from measuring them
one with another in some material way, or from viewing them on the spiritual ground of
more or less of moral excellence, or on that of pure being? But in the case of this last it has
been shown by competent thinkers that it is impossible to conceive of any difference
whatever, if one abstracts being from attributes and properties, and looks at it according to
its bare definition. Again, to conceive of this difference as consisting in the case of the Onlybegotten
and the Spirit in the intensity or abatement of moral excellence, and in consequence
to hint that their nature admits of change in either direction, so as to be equally capable of
opposites, and to be placed in a borderland between moral beauty and its opposite—that is
gross profanity. A man who thinks this will be proving that their nature is one thing in itself,
and becomes something else by virtue of its participation in this beauty or its opposite: as
happens with iron for example: if it is approached some time to the fire, it assumes the
quality of heat while remaining iron: if it is put in snow or ice, it changes its quality to the
mastering influence, and lets the snow’s coldness pass into its pores.</p>
<note type="footnote">119 But He is not begotten. Athanasian Creed.</note>
<note type="footnote">120 Luke x. 18.</note>

<pb n="117"/>
<p>Now just as we cannot name the material of the iron from the quality now to be observed
upon it (for we do not give the name of fire or ice to that which is tempered with either of
these), so the moment we grant the view of these heretics, that in the case121 of the Lifegiving
Power good does not reside in It essentially, but is imparted to it only, it will become
impossible to call it properly good: such a conception of it will compel us to regard it as
something different, as not eternally exhibiting the good, as not in itself to be classed amongst
genuine goods, but as such that the good is at times not in it, and is at times not likely to be
in it. If these existences become good only by sharing in a something superior to themselves,
it is plain that before this participation they were not good, and if, being other than good,
they were then coloured by the influence of good they must certainly, if again isolated from
this, be considered other than good: so that, if this heresy prevails, the Divine Nature cannot
be apprehended as transmissive of good, but rather as itself needing goodness: for how can
one impart to another that which he does not himself possess? If it is in a state of perfection,
no abatement of that can be conceived, and it is absurd to talk of less of perfection. If on the
other hand its participation of good is an imperfect one, and this is what they mean by ‘less,’
mark the consequence that anything in that state can never help an inferior, but will be
busied in satisfying its own want: so that, according to them, Providence is a fiction, and so
is the judgment and the Dispensation of the Only-begotten, and all the other works believed
to be done, and still doing by Him: for He will necessarily be employed in taking care of His
own good, and must abandon the supervision of the Universe122.</p>
<p>If, then, this surmise is to have its way, namely, that our Lord is not perfected in every
kind of good, it is very easy to see the conclusion of the blasphemy. This being so, our faith
is vain, and our preaching vain; our hopes, which take their substance from our faith, are
unsubstantial. Why are they baptized into Christ123, if He has no power of goodness of His
own? God forgive me for saying it! Why do they believe in the Holy Ghost, if the same account
is given of Him? How are they regenerate124 by baptism from their mortal birth, if
the regenerating Power does not possess in its own nature infallibility and independence?
How can their ‘vile body’ be changed, while they think that He who is to change it Himself

needs change, i.e. another to change Him? For as long as a nature is in defect as regards the
good, the superior existence exerts upon this inferior one a ceaseless attraction towards itself:
and this craving for more will never stop: it will be stretching out to something not yet
grasped: the subject of this deficiency will be always demanding a supply, always altering
into the grander nature, and yet will never touch perfection, because it cannot find a goal
to grasp, and cease its impulse upward. The First Good is in its nature infinite, and so it
follows of necessity that the participation in the enjoyment of it will be infinite also, for
more will be always being grasped, and yet something beyond that which has been grasped
will always be discovered, and this search will never overtake its Object, because its fund is
as inexhaustible as the growth of that which participates in it is ceaseless125.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the blasphemies which emerge from their making differences between
the Persons as to the good. If on the other hand the degrees of more or less are to be understood
in this case in some material sense, the absurdity of this surmise will be obvious at
once, without examination in detail. Ideas of quality and distance, weight and figure, and
all that goes to complete the notion of a body, will perforce be introduced along with such
a surmise into the view of the Divine Nature: and where a compound is assumed, there the
dissolution also of that compound must be admitted. A teaching so monstrous, which dares
to discover a smaller and a larger in what is sizeless and not concrete lands us in these and
suchlike conclusions, a few samples only of which are here indicated: nor indeed would it
be easy to unveil all the mischief that lurks beneath it. Still the shocking absurdity that results
from their blasphemous premiss will be clear from this brief notice. We now proceed to
their next position, after a short defining and confirmation of our own doctrine. For an inspired
testimony is a sure test of the truth of any doctrine: and so it seems to me that ours
may be well guaranteed by a quotation from the divine words.</p>
<p>In the division of all existing things, then, we find these distinctions. There is, as appealing
to our perceptions, the Sensible world: and there is, beyond this, the world which the mind,
led on by objects of sense, can view: I mean the Intelligible: and in this we detect again a
further distinction into the Created and the Uncreate: to the latter of which we have defined
the Holy Trinity to belong, to the former all that can exist or can be thought of after that.

there should be some capacities able to receive His blessings, and become continually larger with the inpouring

But in order that this statement may not be left without a proof, but may be confirmed by
Scripture, we will add that our Lord was not created, but came forth from the Father, as the
Word with His own lips attests in the Gospel, in a manner of birth or of proceeding ineffable
and mysterious: and what truer witness could be found than this constant declaration of
our Lord all through the Gospel, that the Very Father was a father, not a creator, of Himself,
and that He was not a work of God, but Son of God? Just as when He wished to name His
connexion with humanity according to the flesh, He called that phase of his being Son of
Man, indicating thereby His kinship according to the nature of the flesh with her from
whom He was born, so also by the title of Son he expresses His true and real relationship
to the Almighty, by that name of Son showing this natural connexion: no matter if there
are some who, for the contradiction of the truth, do take literally and without any explanation,
words used with a hidden meaning in the dark form of parable, and adduce the expression
‘created,’ put into the mouth of Wisdom by the author of the Proverbs126, to support their
perverted views. They say, in fact, that “the Lord created me” is a proof that our Lord is a
creature, as if the Only-begotten Himself in that word confessed it. But we need not heed
such an argument. They do not give reasons why we must refer that text to our Lord at all:
neither will they be able to show that the idea of the word in the Hebrew leads to this and
no other meaning, seeing that the other translators have rendered it by “possessed” or
“constituted:” nor, finally, even if this was the idea in the original text, would its real meaning
be so plain and on the surface: for these proverbial discourses do not show their aim at once,
but rather conceal it, revealing it only by an indirect import, and we may judge of the obscurity
of this particular passage from its context where he says, “When He set His throne
upon the winds127,” and all the similar expressions. What is God’s throne? Is it material or
ideal? What are the winds? Are they these winds so familiar to us, which the natural philosophers
tell us are formed from vapours and exhalations: or are they to be understood in
another way not familiar to man, when they are called the bases of His throne? What is this
throne of the immaterial, incomprehensible, and formless Deity? Who could possibly understand
all this in a literal sense?</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that these are metaphors, which contain a deeper meaning than the
obvious one: so that there is no reason from them that any suspicion that our Lord was
created should be entertained by reverent inquirers, who have been trained according to
the grand words of the evangelist, that “all things that have been made were made by Him”
and “consist in Him.” “Without Him was not anything made that was made.” The evangelist
would not have so defined it if he had believed that our Lord was one among the things
made. How could all things be made by Him and in Him consist, unless their Maker possessed
a nature different from theirs, and so produced, not Himself, but them? If the creation was
by Him, but He was not by Himself, plainly He is something outside the creation. And after
the evangelist has by these words so plainly declared that the things that were made were
made by the Son, and did not pass into existence by any other channel, Paul 128follows and,
to leave no ground at all for this profane talk which numbers even the Spirit amongst the
things that were made, he mentions one after another all the existencies which the evangelist’s
words imply: just as David in fact, after having said that “all things” were put in subjection
to man, adds each species which that “all” comprehends, that is, the creatures on land, in
water, and in air, so does Paul the Apostle, expounder of the divine doctrines, after saying
that all things were made by Him, define by numbering them the meaning of “all.” He speaks
of “the things that are seen129” and “the things that are not seen:” by the first he gives a
general name to all things cognizable by the senses, as we have seen: by the latter he shadows
forth the intelligible world.</p>
<p>Now about the first there is no necessity of going into minute detail. No one is so carnal,
so brutelike, as to imagine that the Spirit resides in the sensible world. But after Paul has
mentioned “the things that are not seen” he proceeds (in order that none may surmise that
the Spirit, because He is of the intelligible and immaterial world, on account of this connexion
subsists therein) to another most distinct division into the things that have been made in
the way of creation, and the existence that is above creation. He mentions the several classes
of these created intelligibles: “130thrones,” “dominions,” “principalities,” “powers,” conveying
his doctrine about these unseen influences in broadly comprehensive terms: but by his very
silence he separates from his list of things created that which is above them. It is just as if
any one was required to name the sectional and inferior officers in some army, and after he
had gone through them all, the commanders of tens, the commanders of hundreds, the

captains and the colonels131, and all the other names given to the authorities over divisions,
omitted after all to speak of the supreme command which extended over all the others: not
from deliberate neglect, or from forgetfulness, but because when required or intending to
name only the several ranks which served under it, it would have been an insult to include
this supreme command in the list of the inferior. So do we find it with Paul, who once in
Paradise was admitted to mysteries, when he had been caught up there, and had become a
spectator of the wonders that are above the heavens, and saw and heard “things which it is
not lawful for a man to utter132.” This Apostle proposes to tell us of all that has been created
by our Lord, and he gives them under certain comprehensive terms: but, having traversed
all the angelic and transcendental world, he stops his reckoning there, and refuses to drag
down to the level of creation that which is above it. Hence there is a clear testimony in
Scripture that the Holy Spirit is higher than the creation. Should any one attempt to refute
this, by urging that neither are the Cherubim mentioned by Paul, that they equally with the
Spirit are left out, and that therefore this omission must prove either that they also are above
the creation, or that the Holy Spirit is not any more than they to be believed above it, let
him measure the full intent of each name in the list: and he will find amongst them that
which from not being actually mentioned seems, but only seems, omitted. Under “thrones”
he includes the Cherubim, giving them this Greek name, as more intelligible than the Hebrew
name for them. He knew that “God sits upon the Cherubim:” and so he calls these Powers
the thrones of Him who sits thereon. In the same way there are included in the list Isaiah’s
Seraphim133, by whom the mystery of the Trinity was luminously proclaimed, when they
uttered that marvellous cry “Holy,” being awestruck with the beauty in each Person of the
Trinity. They are named under the title of “powers” both by the mighty Paul, and by the
prophet David. The latter says, “Bless ye the Lord all ye His powers, ye ministers of His that
do His pleasure134:” and Isaiah instead of saying “Bless ye” has written the very words of
their blessing, “Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory”
and he has revealed by what one of the Seraphim did (to him) that these powers are ministers
that do God’s pleasure, effecting the ‘purging of sin’ according to the will of Him Who sent
them: for this is the ministry of these spiritual beings, viz., to be sent forth for the salvation
of those who are being saved.</p>
<p>That divine Apostle perceived this. He understood that the same matter is indicated
under different names by the two prophets, and he took the best known of the two words,
<note type="footnote">131 ταξιάρχας καὶ λοχαγοὺς, ἑκατοντάρχους τε καὶ χιλιάρχους. The difference between the two pairs seems
to be the difference between ‘non-commissioned’ and ‘commissioned’ officers.</note>

<pb n="122"/>
and called those Seraphim “powers:” so that no ground is left to our critics for saying that
any single one of these beings is omitted equally with the Holy Ghost from the catalogue of
creation. We learn from the existences detailed by Paul that while some existences have
been mentioned, others have been passed over: and while he has taken count of the creation
in masses as it were, he has (elsewhere) mentioned as units those things which are conceived
of singly. For it is a peculiarity of the Holy Trinity that it is to be proclaimed as consisting
of individuals: one Father, one Son, one Holy Ghost: whereas those existences aforesaid are
counted in masses, “dominions,” “principalities,” “lordships,” “powers,” so as to exclude
any suspicion that the Holy Ghost was one of them. Paul is wisely silent upon our mysteries;
he understands how, after having heard those unspeakable words in paradise, to refrain
from proclaiming those secrets when he is making mention of lower beings.</p>
<p>But these foes of the truth rush in upon the ineffable; they degrade the majesty of the
Spirit to the level of the creation; they act as if they had never heard that the Word of God,
when confiding to His disciples the secret of knowing God, Himself said that the life of
135the regenerate was to be completed in them and imparted in the name of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, and, thereby ranking the Spirit with the Father and Himself, precluded
Him from being confused with the creation. From both, therefore, we may get a reverential
and proper conception with regard to Him: from Paul’s omitting the Spirit’s existence in
the mention of the creation, and from our Lord’s joining the Spirit with His Father and
Himself in mentioning the life-giving power. Thus does our reason, under the guidance of
the Scripture, place not only the Only-begotten but the Holy Spirit as well above the creation,
and prompt us in accordance with our Saviour’s command to contemplate Him by faith in
the blessed world of life giving and uncreated existence: and so this unit, which we believe
in, above creation, and sharing in the supreme and absolutely perfect nature, cannot be regarded
as in any way a ‘less,’ although this teacher of heresy attempt to curtail its infinitude
by introducing the idea of degrees, and thus contracting the divine perfection by defining
a greater and a less as residing in the Persons.</p>

<head>§24. His elaborate account of degrees and differences in ‘works’ and ‘energies’ within the
Trinity is absurd.</head>
<p>Now let us see what he adds, as the consequence of this. After saying that we must perforce
regard the Being as greater and less and that while136 the ones, by virtue of a pre-eminent
magnitude and value, occupy a leading place, the others must be detruded to a lower
place, because their nature and their value is secondary, he adds this; “their difference
amounts to that existing between their works: it would in fact be impious to say that the
same energy produced the angels or the stars, and the heavens or man; but one would positively
maintain about this, that in proportion as some works are older and more honourable
than others, so does one energy transcend another, because sameness of energy produces
sameness of work, and difference of work indicates difference of energy.”</p>
<p>I suspect that their author himself would find it difficult to tell us what he meant when
he wrote those words. Their thought is obscured by the rhetorical mud, which is so thick
that one can hardly see beyond any clue to interpret them. “Their difference amounts to
that existing between their works” is a sentence which might be suspected of coming from
some Loxias of pagan story, mystifying his hearers. But if we may make a guess at the drift
of his observations here by following out those which we have already examined, this would
be his meaning, viz., that if we know the amount of difference between one work and another,
we shall know the amount of that between the corresponding energies. But what “works”
he here speaks of, it is impossible to discover from his words. If he means the works to be
observed in the creation, I do not see how this hangs on to what goes before. For the question
was about Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: what occasion was there, then, for one thinking
rationally to inquire one after another into the nature of earth, and water, and air, and fire,
and the different animals, and to distinguish some works as older and more honourable
than others, and to speak of one energy as transcending another? But if he calls the Onlybegotten
and the Holy Spirit “works,” what does he mean by the “differences” of the energies
which produce these works: and what are 137those wonderful energies of this writer which
transcend the others? He has neither explained the particular way in which he means them
to “transcend” each other; nor has he discussed the nature of these energies: but he has advanced
in neither direction, neither proving so far their real subsistence, nor their being
some unsubstantial exertion of a will. Throughout it all his meaning hangs suspended
between these two conceptions, and oscillates from one to the other. He adds that “it would
be impious to say that the same energy produced the angels or the stars, and the heavens or
<note type="footnote">136 τὰς μὲν, i.e. Οὑσίος. Eunomius’ Arianism here degenerates into mere Emanationism: but even in this

to throughout.</note>
<note type="footnote">137 κᾀκείναι αἱ ἐνεργείαι αὖται.</note>

<pb n="124"/>
man.” Again we ask what necessity there is to draw this conclusion from his previous remarks?
I do not see that it is proved any more 138because the energies vary amongst themselves
as much as the works do, and because the works are not all from the same source but
are stated by him to come from different sources. As for the heavens and each angel, star,
and man, or anything else understood by the word “creation,” we know from Scripture that
they are all the work of One: whereas in their system of theology the Son and the Spirit are
not the work of one and the same, the Son being the work of the energy which ‘follows’ the
first Being, and the Spirit the further work of that work. What the connexion, then, is between
that statement and the heavens, man, angel, star, which he drags in, must be revealed by
himself, or some one whom he has initiated into his profound philosophy. The blasphemy
intended by his words is plain enough, but the way the profanity is stated is inconsistent
with itself. To suppose that within the Holy Trinity there is a difference as wide as that which
we can observe between the heavens which envelope the whole creation, and one single man
or the star which shines in them, is openly profane: but still the connexion of such thoughts
and the pertinence of such a comparison is a mystery to me, and I suspect also to its author
himself. If indeed his account of the creation were of this sort, viz., that while the heavens
were the work of some transcendent energy each star in them was the result of an energy
accompanying the heavens, and that then an angel was the result of that star, and a man of
that angel, his argument would then have consisted in a comparison of similar processes,
and might have somewhat confirmed his doctrine. But since he grants that it was all made
by One (unless he wishes to contradict Scripture downright), while he describes the production
of the Persons after a different fashion, what connexion is there between this newly
imported view and what went before?</p>
<p>But let it be granted to him that this comparison does have some connexion with
proving variation amongst the Beings (for this is what he desires to establish); still let us see
how that which follows hangs on to what he has just said, ‘In proportion as one work is
prior to another and more precious than it, so would a pious mind affirm that one energy
transcends another.’ If in this he alludes to the sensible world, the statement is a long way
from the matter in hand. There is no necessity whatever that requires one whose subject is
theological to philosophize about the order in which the different results achieved in the
world-making are to come, and to lay down that the energies of the Creator are higher and
lower analogously to the magnitude of each thing then made. But if he speaks of the Persons
themselves, and means by works that are ‘older and more honourable’ those ‘works’ which
he has just fashioned in his own creed, that is, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, it would be
perhaps better to pass over in silence such an abominable view, than to create even the appearance
of its being an argument by entangling ourselves with it. For can a ‘more honour-
<note type="footnote">138 τῷ παρηλλάχθαι, κ.τ.λ. This is Oehler’s emendation for the faulty reading τὸ of the editions.</note>

<pb n="125"/>
able’ be discovered where there is not a less honourable? If he can go so far, and with so
light a heart, in profanity as to hint that the expression and the idea ‘less precious’ can be
predicated of anything whatever which we believe of the Trinity, then it were well to stop
our ears, and get as quickly as possible out of hearing of such wickedness, and the contagion
of reasoning which will be transfused into the heart, as from a vessel full of uncleanness.</p>
<p>Can any one dare to speak of the divine and supreme Being in such a way that a less
degree of honour in comparison is proved by the argument. “That all,” says the evangelist,
“may honour the Son, as they honour the Father.139” This utterance (and such an utterance
is a law to us) makes a law of this equality in honour: yet this man annuls both the law and
its Giver, and apportions to the One more, to the Other less of honour, by some occult
method for measuring its extra abundance which he has discovered. By the custom of
mankind the differences of worth are the measure of the amount of honour which each in
authority receives; so that inferiors do not approach the lower magistracies in the same guise
exactly as they do the sovereign, and the greater or less display of fear or reverence on their
part indicates the greater or the less worshipfulness in the objects of it: in fact we may discover,
in this disposition of inferiors, who are the specially honourable; when, for instance,
we see some one feared beyond his neighbours, or the recipient of more reverence than the
rest. But in the case of the divine nature, because every perfection in the way of goodness is
connoted with the very name of God, we cannot discover, at all events as we look at it, any
ground for degrees of honour. Where there is no greater and smaller in power, or glory, or
wisdom, or love, or of any other imaginable good whatever, but the good which the Son has
is the Father’s also, and all that is the Father’s is seen in the Son, what possible state of mind
can induce us to show the more reverence in the case of the Father? If we think of royal
power and worth the Son is King: if of a judge, ‘all judgment is committed to the Son140:’
if of the magnificent office of Creation, ‘all things were made by Him141:’ if of the Author
of our life, we know the True Life came down as far as our nature: if of our being taken out
of darkness, we know He is the True Light, who weans us from darkness: if wisdom is precious
to any, Christ is God’s power and Wisdom142.</p>
<p>Our very souls, then, being disposed so naturally and in proportion to their capacity,
and yet so miraculously, to recognize so many and great wonders in Christ, what further
excess of honour is left us to pay exclusively to the Father, as inappropriate to the Son?

Human reverence of the Deity, looked at in its plainest meaning, is nothing else but an attitude
of love towards Him, and a confession of the perfections in Him: and I think that the
precept ‘so ought the Son to be honoured as the Father143,’ is enjoined by the Word in place
of love. For the Law commands that we pay to God this fitting honour by loving Him with
all our heart and strength and here is the equivalent of that love, in that the Word as Lawgiver
thus says, that the Son ought to be honoured as the Father.</p>
<p>It was this kind of honour that the great David fully paid, when he confessed to the Lord
in a prelude144 of his psalmody that he loved the Lord, and told all the reasons for his love,
calling Him his “rock” and “fortress,” and “refuge,” and “deliverer,” and “God-helper,” and
“hope,” and “buckler,” and “horn of salvation,” and “protector.” If the Only-begotten Son
is not all these to mankind, let the excess of honour be reduced to this extent as this heresy
dictates: but if we have always believed Him to be, and to be entitled to, all this and even
more, and to be equal in every operation and conception of the good to the majesty of the
Father’s goodness, how can it be pronounced consistent, either not to love such a character,
or to slight it while we love it? No one can say that we ought to love Him with all our heart
and strength, but to honour Him only with half. If, then, the Son is to be honoured with the
whole heart in rendering to Him all our love, by what device can anything superior to His
honour be discovered, when such a measure of honour is paid Him in the coin of love as
our whole heart is capable of? Vainly, therefore, in the case of Beings essentially honourable,
will any one dogmatize about a superior honour, and by comparison suggest an inferior
honour.</p>
<p>Again; only in the case of the creation is it true to speak of ‘priority.’ The sequence of
works was there displayed in the order of the days; and the heavens may be said to have
preceded by so much the making of man, and that interval may be measured by the interval
of days. But in the divine nature, which transcends all idea of time and surpasses all reach
of thought, to talk of a “prior” and a “later” in the honours of time is a privilege only of this
new-fangled philosophy. In short he who declares the Father to be ‘prior’ to the subsistence
of the Son declares nothing short of this, viz., that the Son is later than the things made by
the Son145 (if at least it is true to say that all the ages, and all duration of time was created
after the Son, and by the Son).</p>

<note type="footnote">145 The meaning is that, if the Son is later (in time) than the Father, then time must have already existed for
this comparison to be made; i.e. the Son is later than time as well as the Father. This involves a contradiction.</note>

<head>§25. He who asserts that the Father is ‘prior’ to the Son with any thought of an interval must
perforce allow that even the Father is not without beginning.</head>
<p>But more than this: what exposes still further the untenableness of this view is, that,
besides positing a beginning in time of the Son’s existence, it does not, when followed out,
spare the Father even, but proves that He also had his beginning in time. For any recognizing
mark that is presupposed for the generation of the Son must certainly define as well the
Father’s beginning.</p>
<p>To make this clear, it will be well to discuss it more carefully. When he pronounces that
the life of the Father is prior to that of the Son, he places a certain interval between the two;
now, he must mean, either that this interval is infinite, or that it is included within fixed
limits. But the principle of an intervening mean will not allow him to call it infinite; he
would annul thereby the very conception of Father and Son and the thought of anything
connecting them, as long as this infinite were limited on neither side, with no idea of a
Father cutting it short above, nor that of a Son checking it below. The very nature of the
infinite is, to be extended in either direction, and to have no bounds of any kind.</p>
<p>Therefore if the conception of Father and Son is to remain firm and immoveable, he
will find no ground for thinking this interval is infinite: his school must place a definite interval
of time between the Only-begotten and the Father. What I say, then, is this: that this
view of theirs will bring us to the conclusion that the Father is not from everlasting, but
from a definite point in time. I will convey my meaning by familiar illustrations; the known
shall make the unknown clear. When we say, on the authority of the text of Moses, that man
was made the fifth day after the heavens, we tacitly imply that before those same days the
heavens did not exist either; a subsequent event goes to define, by means of the interval
which precedes it, the occurrence also of a previous event. If this example does not make
our contention plain, we can give others. We say that ‘the Law given by Moses was four
hundred and thirty years later than the Promise to Abraham.’ If after traversing, step by
step upwards146, the anterior time we reach this end of that number of years, we firmly
grasp as well the fact that, before that date, God’s Promise was not either. Many such instances
could be given, but I decline to be minute and wearisome.</p>
<p>Guided, then, by these examples, let us examine the question before us. Our adversaries
conceive of the existences of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as involving elder and younger,
respectively. Well then; if, at the bidding of this heresy, we journey up beyond the generation
<note type="footnote">146 step by step upwards. δι᾽ ἀναλύσεως. This does not seem to be used in the Platonic (dialectic) sense, but
in the N.T. sense of “return” or “retrogression,” cf. Luke xii. 36. Gregory elsewhere De Hom. Opif. xxv.), uses
ἀναλύειν in this sense: speaking of the three examples of Christ’s power of raising from the dead, he says, ‘you
see…all these equally at the command of one and the same voice returning (ἀναλύοντας) to life.’ ᾽Αναλύσις

of the Son, and approach that intervening duration which the mere fancy of these dogmatists
supposes between the Father and the Son, and then reach that other and supreme point of
time by which they close that duration, there we find the life of the Father fixed as it were
upon an apex; and thence we must necessarily conclude that before it the Father is not to
be believed to have existed always.</p>
<p>If you still feel difficulties about this, let us again take an illustration. It shall be that of
two rulers, one shorter than the other. If we fit the bases of the two together we know from
the tops the extra length of the one; from the end of the lesser lying alongside of it we
measure this excess, supplementing the deficiency of the shorter ruler by a calculation, and
so bringing it up to the end of the longer; a cubit for instance, or whatever be the distance
of the one end from the other. So, if there is, as our adversaries say, an excess of some kind
in the Father’s life as compared with the Son’s, it must needs consist in some definite interval
of duration: and they will allow that this interval of excess cannot be in the future, for that
Both are imperishable, even the foes of the truth will grant. No; they conceive of this difference
as in the past, and instead of equalizing the life of the Father and the Son there, they
extend the conception of the Father by an interval of living. But every interval must be
bounded by two ends: and so for this interval which they have devised we must grasp the
two points by which the ends are denoted. The one portion takes its beginning, in their
view, from the Son’s generation; and the other portion must end in some other point, from
which the interval starts, and by which it limits itself. What this is, is for them to tell us;
unless, indeed, they are ashamed of the consequences of their own assumptions.</p>
<p>It admits not of a doubt, then, that they will not be able to find at all the other portion,
corresponding to the first portion of their fancied interval, except they were to suppose
some beginning of their Ungenerate, whence the middle, that connects with the generation
of the Son, may be conceived of as starting. We affirm, then, that when he makes the Son
later than the Father by a certain intervening extension of life, he must grant a fixed beginning
to the Father’s existence also, regulated by this same interval of his devising; and thus their
much-vaunted “Ungeneracy” of the Father will be found to be undermined by its own
champions’ arguments; and they will have to confess that their Ungenerate God did once
not exist, but began from a starting-point: indeed, that which has a beginning of being is
not inoriginate. But if we must at all risks confess this absence of beginning in the Father,
let not such exactitude be displayed in fixing for the life of the Son a point which, as the
term of His existence, must cut Him off from the life on the other side of it; let it suffice on
the ground of causation only to conceive of the Father as before the Son; and let not the
Father’s life be thought of as a separate and peculiar one before the generation of the Son,
lest we should have to admit the idea inevitably associated with this of an interval before
the appearance of the Son which measures the life of Him Who begot Him, and then the
necessary consequence of this, that a beginning of the Father’s life also must be supposed

<pb n="129"/>
by virtue of which their fancied interval may be stayed in its upward advance so as to set a
limit and a beginning to this previous life of the Father as well: let it suffice for us, when we
confess the ‘coming from Him,’ to admit also, bold as it may seem, the ‘living along with
Him;’ for we are led by the written oracles to such a belief. For we have been taught by
Wisdom to contemplate the brightness147 of the everlasting light in, and together with, the
very everlastingness of that primal light, joining in one idea the brightness and its cause,
and admitting no priority. Thus shall we save the theory of our Faith, the Son’s life not
failing in the upward view, and the Father’s everlastingness being not trenched upon by
supposing any definite beginning for the Son.</p>

<head>§26. It will not do to apply this conception, as drawn out above, of the Father and Son to the
Creation, as they insist on doing: but we must contemplate the Son apart with the Father,
and believe that the Creation had its origin from a definite point.</head>
<p>But perhaps some of the opponents of this will say, ‘The Creation also has an acknow-
ledged beginning; and yet the things in it are not connected in thought with the everlastingness
of the Father, and it does not check, by having a beginning of its own, the infinitude
of the divine life, which is the monstrous conclusion this discussion has pointed out in the
case of the Father and the Son. One therefore of two things must follow. Either the Creation
is everlasting; or, it must be boldly admitted, the Son is later in time (than the Father). The
conception of an interval in time will lead to monstrous conclusions, even when measured
from the Creation up to the Creator.’</p>
<p>One who demurs so, perhaps from not attending closely to the meaning of our belief,
fights against it with alien comparisons which have nothing to do with the matter in hand.
If he could point to anything above Creation which has its origin marked by any interval
of time, and it were acknowledged possible by all to think of any time-interval as existing
before Creation, he might have occasion for endeavouring to destroy by such attacks that
everlastingness of the Son which we have proved above. But seeing that by all the suffrages
of the faithful it is agreed that, of all things that are, part is by creation, and part before creation,
and that the divine nature is to be believed uncreate (although within it, as our faith
teaches, there is a cause, and there is a subsistence produced, but without separation, from
the cause), while the creation is to be viewed in an extension of distances,—all order and
sequence of time in events can be perceived only in the ages (of this creation), but the nature
pre-existent to those ages escapes all distinctions of before and after, because reason cannot
see in that divine and blessed life the things which it observes, and that exclusively, in creation.
The creation, as we have said, comes into existence according to a sequence of order,
and is commensurate with the duration of the ages, so that if one ascends along the line of
things created to their beginning, one will bound the search with the foundation of those
ages. But the world above creation, being removed from all conception of distance, eludes
all sequence of time: it has no commencement of that sort: it has no end in which to cease
its advance, according to any discoverable method of order. Having traversed the ages and
all that has been produced therein, our thought catches a glimpse of the divine nature, as
of some immense ocean, but when the imagination stretches onward to grasp it, it gives no
sign in its own case of any beginning; so that one who after inquiring with curiosity into
the ‘priority’ of the ages tries to mount to the source of all things will never be able to make
a single calculation on which he may stand; that which he seeks will always be moving on
before, and no basis will be offered him for the curiosity of thought.</p>
<p>It is clear, even with a moderate insight into the nature of things, that there is nothing
by which we can measure the divine and blessed Life. It is not in time, but time flows from

<pb n="131"/>
it; whereas the creation, starting from a manifest beginning, journeys onward to its proper
end through spaces of time; so that it is possible, as Solomon somewhere148 says, to detect
in it a beginning, an end, and a middle; and mark the sequence of its history by divisions of
time. But the supreme and blessed life has no time-extension accompanying its course, and
therefore no span nor measure. Created things are confined within the fitting measures, as
within a boundary, with due regard to the good adjustment of the whole by the pleasure of
a wise Creator; and so, though human reason in its weakness cannot reach the whole way
to the contents of creation, yet still we do not doubt that the creative power has assigned to
all of them their limits and that they do not stretch beyond creation. But this creative power
itself, while circumscribing by itself the growth of things, has itself no circumscribing bounds;
it buries in itself every effort of thought to mount up to the source of God’s life, and it eludes
the busy and ambitious strivings to get to the end of the Infinite. Every discursive effort of
thought to go back beyond the ages will ascend only so far as to see that that which it seeks
can never be passed through: time and its contents seem the measure and the limit of the
movement and the working of human thought, but that which lies beyond remains outside
its reach; it is a world where it may not tread, unsullied by any object that can be comprehended
by man. No form, no place, no size, no reckoning of time, or anything else knowable,
is there: and so it is inevitable that our apprehensive faculty, seeking as it does always some
object to grasp, must fall back from any side of this incomprehensible existence, and seek
in the ages and in the creation which they hold its kindred and congenial sphere.</p>
<p>All, I say, with any insight, however moderate, into the nature of things, know that the
world’s Creator laid time and space as a background to receive what was to be; on this
foundation He builds the universe. It is not possible that anything which has come or is
now coming into being by way of creation can be independent of space or time. But the
existence which is all-sufficient, everlasting, world-enveloping, is not in space, nor in time:
it is before these, and above these in an ineffable way; self-contained, knowable by faith
alone; immeasurable by ages; without the accompaniment of time; seated and resting in itself,
with no associations of past or future, there being nothing beside and beyond itself, whose
passing can make something past and something future. Such accidents are confined to the
creation, whose life is divided with time’s divisions into memory and hope. But within that
transcendent and blessed Power all things are equally present as in an instant: past and future
are within its all-encircling grasp and its comprehensive view.</p>
<p>This is the Being in which, to use the words of the Apostle, all things are formed; and
we, with our individual share in existence, live and move, and have our being149. It is above
beginning, and presents no marks of its inmost nature: it is to be known of only in the im-
<note type="footnote">148 Compare Eccles. iii. 1–11; and viii. 5, “and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.”</note>

<pb n="132"/>
possibility of perceiving it. That indeed is its most special characteristic, that its nature is
too high for any distinctive attribute. A very different account to the Uncreate must be given
of Creation: it is this very thing that takes it out of all comparison and connexion with its
Maker; this difference, I mean, of essence, and this admitting a special account explanatory
of its nature which has nothing in common with that of Him who made it. The Divine nature
is a stranger to these special marks in the creation: It leaves beneath itself the sections of
time, the ‘before’ and the ‘after,’ and the ideas of space: in fact ‘higher’ cannot properly be
said of it at all. Every conception about that uncreate Power is a sublime principle, and involves
the idea of what is proper in the highest degree150.</p>
<p>We have shewn, then, by what we have said that the Only-begotten and the Holy Spirit
are not to be looked for in the creation but are to be believed above it; and that while the
creation may perhaps by the persevering efforts of ambitious seekers be seized in its own
beginning, whatever that may be, the supernatural will not the more for that come within
the realm of knowledge, for no mark before the ages indicative of its nature can be found.
Well, then, if in this uncreate existence those wondrous realities, with their wondrous names
of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are to be in our thoughts, how can we imagine, of that pretemporal
world, that which our busy, restless minds perceive in things here below by comparing
one of them with another and giving it precedence by an interval of time? For there,
with the Father, unoriginate, ungenerate, always Father, the idea of the Son as coming from
Him yet side by side with Him is inseparably joined; and through the Son and yet with Him,
before any vague and unsubstantial conception comes in between, the Holy Spirit is found
at once in closest union; not subsequent in existence to the Son, as if the Son could be thought
of as ever having been without the Spirit; but Himself also owning the same cause of His
being, i.e. the God over all, as the Only-begotten Light, and having shone forth in that very
Light, being divisible neither by duration nor by an alien nature from the Father or from
the Only-begotten. There are no intervals in that pre-temporal world: and difference on the
score of being there is none. It is not even possible, comparing the uncreate with the uncreated,
to see differences; and the Holy Ghost is uncreate, as we have before shewn.</p>
<p>This being the view held by all who accept in its simplicity the undiluted Gospel, what
occasion was there for endeavouring to dissolve this fast union of the Son with the Father
by means of the creation, as if it were necessary to suppose either that the Son was from
everlasting along with the creation, or that He too, equally with it, was later? For the generation
of the Son does not fall within time151, any more than the creation was before time:
<note type="footnote">150 καὶ τὸν τοῦ κυριωτάτου λόγον ἐπέχει·</note>
<note type="footnote">151 The generation of the Son does not fall within time. On this “eternal generation” Denys (De la Philosophie
d’Origéne, p. 452) has the following remarks, illustrating the probable way that Athanasians would have dealt
with Eunomius: “If we do not see how God’s indivisibility remains in the co-existence of the three Persons, we
can throw the blame of this difficulty upon the feebleness of our reason: while it is a manifest contradiction to</note>

so that it can in no kind of way be right to partition the indivisible, and to insert, by declaring
that there was a time when the Author of all existence was not, this false idea of time into
the creative Source of the Universe.</p>
<p>Our previous contention, therefore, is true, that the everlastingness of the Son is included,
along with the idea of His birth, in the Father’s ungeneracy; and that, if any interval were
to be imagined dividing the two, that same interval would fix a beginning for the life of the
Almighty;—a monstrous supposition. But there is nothing to prevent the creation, being,
as it is, in its own nature something other than its Creator and in no point trenching on that
pure pre-temporal world, from having, in our belief, a beginning of its own, as we have said.
To say that the heavens and the earth and other contents of creation were out of things
which are not, or, as the Apostle says, out of “things not seen,152” inflicts no dishonour
upon the Maker of this universe; for we know from Scripture that all these things are not
from everlasting nor will remain for ever. If on the other hand it could be believed that there
is something in the Holy Trinity which does not coexist with the Father, if following out
this heresy any thought could be entertained of stripping the Almighty of the glory of the
Son and Holy Ghost, it would end in nothing else than in a God manifestly removed from
every deed and thought that was good and godlike. But if the Father, existing before the
ages, is always in glory, and the pre-temporal Son is His glory, and if in like manner the
Spirit of Christ is the Son’s glory, always to be contemplated along with the Father and the
<note type="footnote">admit at one and the same time the simplicity of the Uncreated, and some change or inequality within His Being.
I know that the defenders of the orthodox belief might be troubled with their adversaries’ argument. (Eunom.
Apol. 22.) ‘If we admit that the Son, the energy creative of the world, is equal to the Father, it amounts to admitting
that He is the actual energy of the Father in Creation, and that this energy is equal to His essence. But that is to
return to the mistake of the Greeks who identified His essence and His energy, and consequently made the world
coexist with God.’ A serious difficulty, certainly, and one that has never yet been solved, nor will be; as all the
questions likewise which refer to the Uncreated and Created, to eternity and time. It is true we cannot explain
how God’s eternally active energy does prolong itself eternally. But what is this difficulty compared with those
which, with the hypothesis of Eunomius, must be swallowed? We must suppose, so, that the ᾽Αγέννητος, since
His energy is not eternal, became in a given place and moment, and that He was at that point the Γεννητός. We
must suppose that this activity communicated to a creature that privilege of the Uncreated which is most incommunicable,
viz. the power of creating other creatures. We must suppose that these creatures, unconnected as
they are with the ᾽Αγέννητος (since He has not made them), nevertheless conceive of and see beyond their own
creator a Being, who cannot be anything to them. [This direct intuition on our part of the Deity was a special
tenet of Eunomius.] Finally we must suppose that these creatures, seeing that Eunomius agrees with orthodox
believers that the end of this world will be but a commencement, will enter into new relations with this ᾽Αγέννητος,
when the Son shall have submitted all things to the Father.”</note>

<head>§27. He falsely imagines that the same energies produce the same works, and that variation
in the works indicates variation in the energies.</head>
<p>Of the same strain is that which he adds in the next paragraph; “the same energies producing
sameness of works, and different works indicating difference in the energies as well.”
Finely and irresistibly does this noble thinker plead for his doctrine. “The same energies
produce sameness of works.” Let us test this by facts. The energy of fire is always one and
the same; it consists in heating: but what sort of agreement do its results show? Bronze melts
in it; mud hardens; wax vanishes: while all other animals are destroyed by it, the salamander
is preserved alive154; tow burns, asbestos is washed by the flames as if by water; so much
for his ‘sameness of works from one and the same energy.’ How too about the sun? Is not
his power of warming always the same; and yet while he causes one plant to grow, he withers
another, varying the results of his operation in accordance with the latent force of each.
‘That on the rock’ withers; ‘that in deep earth’ yields an hundredfold. Investigate Nature’s
work, and you will learn, in the case of those bodies which she produces artistically, the
amount of accuracy there is in his statement that ‘sameness of energy effects sameness of
result.’ One single operation is the cause of conception, but the composition of that which
is effected internally therein is so varied that it would be difficult for any one even to count
all the various qualities of the body. Again, imbibing the milk is one single operation on the
part of the infant, but the results of its being nourished so are too complex to be all detailed.
While this food passes from the channel of the mouth into the secretory ducts155, the
transforming power of Nature forwards it into the several parts proportionately to their
wants; for by digestion she divides its sum total into the small change of multitudinous differences,
and into supplies congenial to the subject matter with which she deals; so that the
same milk goes to feed arteries, veins, brain and its membranes, marrow, bones, nerves156,
sinews, tendons, flesh, surface, cartilages, fat, hair, nails, perspiration, vapours, phlegm, bile,
and besides these, all useless superfluities deriving from the same source. You could not
name either an organ, whether of motion or sensation, or anything else making up the
body’s bulk, which was not formed (in spite of startling differences) from this one and selfsame
operation of feeding. If one were to compare the mechanic arts too it will be seen what
is the scientific value of his statement; for there we see in them all the same operation, I
mean the movement of the hands; but what have the results in common? What has building
a shrine to do with a coat, though manual labour is employed on both? The house-breaker

and the well-digger both move their hands: the mining of the earth, the murder of a man
are results of the motion of the hands. The soldier slays the foe, and the husbandman wields
the fork which breaks the clod, with his hands. How, then, can this doctrinaire lay it down
that the ‘same energies produce sameness of work?’ But even if we were to grant that this
view of his had any truth in it, the essential union of the Son with the Father, and of the
Holy Spirit with the Son, is yet again more fully proved. For if there existed any variation
in their energies, so that the Son worked His will in a different manner to the Father, then
(on the above supposition) it would be fair to conjecture, from this variation, a variation
also in the beings which were the result of these varying energies. But if it is true that the
manner of the Father’s working is likewise the manner always of the Son’s, both from our
Lord’s own words and from what we should have expected a priori—(for the one is not
unbodied while the other is embodied, the one is not from this material, the other from that,
the one does not work his will in this time and place, the other in that time and place, nor
is there difference of organs in them producing difference of result, but the sole movement
of their wish and of their will is sufficient, seconded in the founding of the universe by the
power that can create anything)—if, I say, it is true that in all respects the Father from Whom
are all things, and the Son by Whom are all things in the actual form of their operation work
alike, then how can this man hope to prove the essential difference between the Son and the
Holy Ghost by any difference and separation between the working of the Son and the
Father? The very opposite, as we have just seen, is proved to be the case157; seeing that there
is no manner of difference contemplated between the working of the Father and that of the
Son; and so that there is no gulf whatever between the being of the Son and the being of the
Spirit, is shewn by the identity of the power which gives them their subsistence; and our
pamphleteer himself confirms this; for these are his words verbatim: “the same energies
producing sameness of works.” If sameness of works is really produced by likeness of energies,
and if (as they say) the Son is the work of the Father and the Spirit the work of the Son, the
likeness in manner158 of the Father’s and the Son’s energies will demonstrate the sameness
of these beings who each result from them.</p>
<p>But he adds, “variation in the works indicates variation in the energies.” How, again, is
this dictum of his corroborated by facts? Look, if you please, at plain instances. Is not the
‘energy’ of command, in Him who embodied the world and all things therein by His sole
will, a single energy? “He spake and they were made. He commanded and they were created.”
Was not the thing commanded in every case alike given existence: did not His single will
suffice to give subsistence to the nonexistent? How, then, when such vast differences are
157 Punctuating παρασκευάζεται, ἐπείδὴ, κ.τ.λ. instead of a full stop, as Oehler.
158 Gregory replaces ‘sameness’ (in the case of the energies in Eunomius argument) by ‘likeness’ since the
Father and the Son could not be said to be the same, and their energies, therefore, are not identical but similar.

<pb n="137"/>
seen coming from that one energy of command, can this man shut his eyes to realities, and
declare that the difference of works indicates difference of energies? If our dogmatist insists
on this, that difference of works implies difference of energies, then we should have expected
the very contrary to that which is the case; viz., that everything in the world should be of
one type. Can it be that he does see here a universal likeness, and detects unlikeness only
between the Father and the Son?</p>
<p>Let him, then, observe, if he never did before, the dissimilarity amongst the elements
of the world, and how each thing that goes to make up the framework of the whole hangs
on to its natural opposite. Some objects are light and buoyant, others heavy and gravitating;
some are always still, others always moving; and amongst these last some move unchangingly
on one plan159, as the heaven, for instance, and the planets, whose courses all revolve the
opposite way to the universe, others are transfused in all directions and rush at random, as
air and sea for instance, and every substance which is naturally penetrating160. What need
to mention the contrasts seen between heat and cold, moist and dry, high and low position?
As for the numerous dissimilarities amongst animals and plants, on the score of figure and
size, and all the variations of their products and their qualities, the human mind would fail
to follow them.</p>

<head>§28. He falsely imagines that we can have an unalterable series of harmonious natures existing
side by side.</head>
<p>But this man of science still declares that varied works have energies as varied to produce
them. Either he knows not yet the nature of the Divine energy, as taught by Scripture,—‘All
things were made by the word of His command,’—or else he is blind to the differences of
existing things. He utters for our benefit these inconsiderate statements, and lays down the
law about divine doctrines, as if he had never yet heard that anything that is merely asserted,—
where no entirely undeniable and plain statement is made about the matter in hand,
and where the asserter says on his own responsibility that which a cautious listener cannot
assent to,—is no better than a telling of dreams or of stories over wine. Little then as this
dictum of his fits facts, nevertheless,—like one who is deluded by a dream into thinking that
he sees one of the objects of his waking efforts, and who grasps eagerly at this phantom and
with eyes deceived by this visionary desire thinks that he holds it,—he with this dreamlike
outline of doctrines before him imagines that his words possess force, and insists upon their
truth, and essays by them to prove all the rest. It is worth while to give the passage. “These
being so, and maintaining an unbroken connexion in their relation to each other, it seems
fitting for those who make their investigation according to the order germane to the subject,
and who do not insist on mixing and confusing all together, in case of a discussion being
raised about Being, to prove what is in course of demonstration, and to settle the points in
debate, by the primary energies and those attached to the Beings, and again to explain by
the Being when the energies are in question.” I think the actual phrases of his impiety are
enough to prove how absurd is this teaching. If any one had to give a description of the way
some disease mars a human countenance, he would explain it better by actually unbandaging
the patient, and there would be then no need of words when the eye had seen how he looked.
So some mental eye might discern the hideous mutilation wrought by this heresy: its mere
perusal might remove the veil. But since it is necessary, in order to make the latent mischief
of this teaching clear to the many, to put the finger of demonstration upon it, I will again
repeat each word. “This being so.” What does this dreamer mean? What is ‘this?’ How has
it been stated? “The Father’s being is alone proper and in the highest degree supreme; consequently
the next being is dependent, and the third more dependent still.” In such words
he lays down the law. But why? Is it because an energy accompanies the first being, of which
the effect and work, the Only-begotten, is circumscribed by the sphere of this producing
cause? Or because these Beings are to be thought of as of greater or less extent, the smaller
included within and surrounded by the larger, like casks put one inside the other, inasmuch
as he detects degrees of size within Beings that are illimitable? Or because differences of
products imply differences of producers, as if it were impossible that different effects should
be produced by similar energies? Well, there is no one whose mental faculties are so steeped
in sleep as to acquiesce directly after hearing such statements in the following assertion,

<pb n="139"/>
“these being so, and maintaining an unbroken connexion in their relation to one another.”
It is equal madness to say such things, and to hear them without any questioning. They are
placed in a ‘series’ and ‘an unalterable relation to each other,’ and yet they are parted from
each other by an essential unlikeness! Either, as our own doctrine insists, they are united in
being, and then they really preserve an unalterable relation to each other; or else they stand
apart in essential unlikeness, as he fancies. But what series, what relationship that is unalterable
can exist with alien entities? And how can they present that ‘order germane to the
matter’ which according to him is to rule the investigation? Now if he had an eye only on
the doctrine of the truth, and if the order in which he counts the differences was only that
of the attributes which Faith sees in the Holy Trinity,—an order so ‘natural’ and ‘germane’
that the Persons cannot be confounded, being divided as Persons, though united in their
being—then he would not have been classed at all amongst our enemies, for he would mean
the very same doctrine that we teach. But, as it is, he is looking in the very contrary direction,
and he makes the order which he fancies there quite inconceivable. There is all the difference
in the world between the accomplishment of an act of the will, and that of a mechanical law
of nature. Heat is inherent in fire, splendour in the sunbeam, fluidity in water, downward
tendency in a stone, and so on. But if a man builds a house, or seeks an office, or puts to sea
with a cargo, or attempts anything else which requires forethought and preparation to succeed,
we cannot say in such a case that there is properly a rank or order inherent in his operations:
their order in each case will result as an after consequence of the motive which
guided his choice, or the utility of that which he achieves. Well, then; since this heresy parts
the Son from any essential relationship with the Father, and adopts the same view of the
Spirit as estranged from any union with the Father or the Son, and since also it affirms
throughout that the Son is the work of the Father, and the Spirit the work of the Son, and
that these works are the results of a purpose, not of nature, what grounds has he for declaring
that this work of a will is an ‘order inherent in the matter,’ and what is the drift of this
teaching, which makes the Almighty the manufacturer of such a nature as this in the Son
and the Holy Spirit, where transcendent beings are made such as to be inferior the one to
the other? If such is really his meaning, why did he not clearly state the grounds he has for
presuming in the case of the Deity, that smallness of result will be evidence of all the greater
power? But who really could ever allow that a cause that is great and powerful is to be looked
for in this smallness of results? As if God was unable to establish His own perfection in
anything that comes from Him161! And how can he attribute to the Deity the highest
prerogative of supremacy while he exhibits His power as thus falling short of His will? Eunomius
certainly seems to mean that perfection was not even proposed as the aim of God’s
work, for fear the honour and glory of One to Whom homage is due for His superiority
<note type="footnote">161 ἐν παντὶ τῷ ἐξ αὐτοῦ.</note>

<pb n="140"/>
might be thereby lessened. And yet is there any one so narrow-minded as to reckon the
Blessed Deity Himself as not free from the passion of envy? What plausible reason, then, is
left why the Supreme Deity should have constituted such an ‘order’ in the case of the Son
and the Spirit? “But I did not mean that ‘order’ to come from Him,” he rejoins. But whence
else, if the beings to which this ‘order’ is connatural are not essentially related to each other?
But perhaps he calls the inferiority itself of the being of the Son and of the Spirit this ‘connatural
order.’ But I would beg of him to tell me the reason of this very thing, viz., why the
Son is inferior on the score of being, when both this being and energy are to be discovered
in the same characteristics and attributes. If on the other hand there is not to be the same162
definition of being and energy, and each is to signify something different, why does he introduce
a demonstration of the thing in question by means of that which is quite different
from it? It would be, in that case, just as if, when it was debated with regard to man’s own
being whether he were a risible animal, or one capable of being taught to read, some one
was to adduce the building of a house or ship on the part of a mason or a shipwright as a
settling of the question, insisting on the skilful syllogism that we know beings by operations,
and a house and a ship are operations of man. Do we then learn, most simple sir, by such
premisses, that man is risible as well as broad-nailed? Some one might well retort; ‘whether
man possesses motion and energy was not the question: it was, what is the energizing principle
itself; and that I fail to learn from your way of deciding the question.’ Indeed, if we
wanted to know something about the nature of the wind, you would not give a satisfactory
answer by pointing to a heap of sand or chaff raised by the wind, or to dust which it scattered:
for the account to be given of the wind is quite different: and these illustrations of yours
would be foreign to the subject. What ground, then, has he for attempting to explain beings
by their energies, and making the definition of an entity out of the resultants of that entity.</p>
<p>Let us observe, too, what sort of work of the Father it is by which the Father’s being,
according to him, is to be comprehended. The Son most certainly, he will say, if he says as
usual. But this Son of yours, most learned sir, is commensurate in your scheme only with
the energy which produced Him, and indicates that alone, while the Object of our search
still keeps in the dark, if, as you yourself confess, this energy is only one amongst the things
which ‘follow163’ the first being. This energy, as you say, extends itself into the work which
it produces, but it does not reveal therein even its own nature, but only so much of it as we
can get a glimpse of in that work. All the resources of a smith are not set in motion to make
a gimlet; the skill of that artisan only operates so far as is adequate to form that tool, though
<note type="footnote">162 Reading αὑτὸς; instead of Oehler’s αὐτὸς.</note>
<note type="footnote">163 only one thing amongst the things which follow, U+0026c. The Latin translation is manifestly wrong here, “si
recte a te assertum est, iis etiam quæ ad primam substantiam sequuntur aliquam operationem inesse.” The Greek
is εἴπερ ἡ ἐνέργεια τῶν παρεπομένων τις εἶναι τῇ πρώτη οὐσία μεμαρτύρηται</note>

<pb n="141"/>
it could fashion a large variety of other tools. Thus the limit of the energy is to be found in
the work which it produces. But the question now is not about the amount of the energy,
but about the being of that which has put forth the energy. In the same way, if he asserts
that he can perceive the nature of the Only-begotten in the Spirit (Whom he styles the work
of an energy which ‘follows’ the Son), his assertion has no foundation; for here again the
energy, while it extends itself into its work, does not reveal therein the nature either of itself
or of the agent who exerts it.</p>
<p>But let us yield in this; grant him that beings are known in their energies. The First being
is known through His work; and this Second being is revealed in the work proceeding from
Him. But what, my learned friend, is to show this Third being? No such work of this Third
is to be found. If you insist that these beings are perceived by their energies, you must confess
that the Spirit’s nature is imperceptible; you cannot infer His nature from any energy put
forth by Him to carry on the continuity. Show some substantiated work of the Spirit, through
which you think you have detected the being of the Spirit, or all your cobweb will collapse
at the touch of Reason. If the being is known by the subsequent energy, and substantiated
energy of the Spirit there is none, such as ye say the Father shows in the Son, and the Son
in the Spirit, then the nature of the Spirit must be confessed unknowable and not be apprehended
through these; there is no energy conceived of in connexion with a substance to
show even a side glimpse of it. But if the Spirit eludes apprehension, how by means of that
which is itself imperceptible can the more exalted being be perceived? If the Son’s work,
that is, the Spirit according to them, is unknowable, the Son Himself can never be known;
He will be involved in the obscurity of that which gives evidence of Him: and if the being
of the Son in this way is hidden, how can the being who is most properly such and most
supreme be brought to light by means of the being which is itself hidden; this obscurity of
the Spirit is transmitted by retrogression164 through the Son to the Father; so that in this
view, even by our adversaries’ confession, the unknowableness of the Fathers being is clearly
demonstrated. How, then, can this man, be his eye ever so ‘keen to see unsubstantial entities,’
discern the nature of the unseen and incomprehensible by means of itself; and how can he
command us to grasp the beings by means of their works, and their works again from them?</p>

<head>§29. He vainly thinks that the doubt about the energies is to be solved by the beings, and reversely.</head>
<p>Now let us see what comes next. ‘The doubt about the energies is to be solved by the
beings.’ What way is there of bringing this man out of his vain fancies down to common
sense? If he thinks that it is possible thus to solve doubts about the energies by comprehending
the beings themselves, how, if these last are not comprehended, can he change this doubt
to any certainty? If the being has been comprehended, what need to make the energy of this
importance, as if it was going to lead us to the comprehension of the being. But if this is the
very thing that makes an examination of the energy necessary, viz., that we may be thereby
guided to the understanding of the being that exerts it, how can this as yet unknown nature
solve the doubt about the energy? The proof of anything that is doubted must be made by
means of well-known truths; but when there is an equal uncertainty about both the objects
of our search, how can Eunomius say that they are comprehended by means of each other,
both being in themselves beyond our knowledge? When the Father’s being is under discussion,
he tells us that the question may be settled by means of the energy which follows Him
and of the work which this energy accomplishes; but when the inquiry is about the being
of the Only-begotten, whether Eunomius calls Him an energy or a product of the energy
(for he does both), then he tells us that the question may be easily solved by looking at the
being of His producer!</p>

<head>§30. There is no Word of God that commands such investigations: the uselessness of the
philosophy which makes them is thereby proved.</head>
<p>I should like also to ask him this. Does he mean that energies are explained by the beings
which produced them only in the case of the Divine Nature, or does he recognize the nature
of the produced by means of the being of the producer with regard to anything whatever
that possesses an effective force? If in the case of the Divine Nature only he holds this view,
let him show us how he settles questions about the works of God by means of the nature of
the Worker. Take an undoubted work of God,—the sky, the earth, the sea, the whole universe.
Let it be the being of one of these that, according to our supposition, is being enquired into,
and let ‘sky’ be the subject fixed for our speculative reasoning. It is a question what the
substance of the sky is; opinions have been broached about it varying widely according to
the lights of each natural philosopher. How will the contemplation of the Maker of the sky
procure a solution of the question, immaterial, invisible, formless, ungenerate, everlasting,
incapable of decay and change and alteration, and all such things, as He is. How will anyone
who entertains this conception of the Worker be led on to the knowledge of the nature of
the sky? How will he get an idea of a thing which is visible from the Invisible, of the perishable
from the imperishable, of that which has a date for its existence from that which never had
any generation, of that which has duration but for a time from the everlasting; in fact, of
the object of his search from everything which is the very opposite to it. Let this man who
has accurately probed the secret of things tell us how it is possible that two unlike things
should be known from each other.</p>

<head>§31. The observations made by watching Providence are sufficient to give us the knowledge
of sameness of Being.</head>
<p>And yet, if he could see the consequences of his own statements, he would be led on by
them to acquiesce in the doctrine of the Church. For if the maker’s nature is an indication
of the thing made, as he affirms, and if, according to his school, the Son is something made
by the Father, anyone who has observed the Father’s nature would have certainly known
thereby that of the Son; if, I say, it is true that the worker’s nature is a sign of that which he
works. But the Only-begotten, as they say, of the Father’s unlikeness, will be excluded from
operating through Providence. Eunomius need not trouble any more about His being generated,
nor force out of that another proof of the son’s unlikeness. The difference of purpose
will itself be sufficient to bring to light His alien nature. For the First Being is, even by our
opponents’ confession, one and single, and necessarily His will must be thought of as following
the bent of His nature; but Providence shows that purpose is good, and so the nature
from which that purpose comes is shown to be good also. So the Father alone works good;
and the Son does not purpose the same things as He, if we adopt the assumptions of our
adversary; the difference then, of their nature will be clearly attested by this variation of
their purposes. But if, while the Father is provident for the Universe, the Son is equally
provident for it (for ‘what He sees the Father doing that also the Son does’), this sameness
of their purposes exhibits a communion of nature in those who thus purpose the same
things. Why, then, is all mention of Providence omitted by him, as if it would not help us
at all to that which we are searching for. Yet many familiar examples make for our view of
it. Anyone who has gazed on the brightness of fire and experienced its power of warming,
when he approaches another such brightness and another such warmth, will assuredly be
led on to think of fire; for his senses through the medium of these similar phænomena will
conduct him to the fact of a kindred element producing both; anything that was not fire
could not work on all occasions like fire. Just so, when we perceive a similar and equal
amount of providential power in the Father and in the Son, we make a guess by means of
what thus comes within the range of our knowledge about things which transcend our
comprehension; we feel that causes of an alien nature cannot be detected in these equal and
similar effects. As the observed phenomena are to each other, so will the subjects of those
phenomena be: if the first are opposed to each other, we must reckon the revealed entities
to be so too; if the first are alike, so too must those others be. Our Lord said allegorically
that their fruit is the sign of the characters of trees, meaning that it does not belie that
character, that the bad is not attached to the good tree, nor the good to the bad tree;—“by
their fruits ye shall know them;”—so when the fruit, Providence, presents no difference, we
detect a single nature from which that fruit has sprung, even though the trees be different
from which the fruit is put forth. Through that, then, which is cognizable by our apprehension,
viz., the scheme or Providence visible in the Son in the same way as in the Father, the

<pb n="145"/>
common likeness of the Only-begotten and the Father is placed beyond a doubt; and it is
the identity of the fruits of Providence by which we know it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">  
<pb n="146"/>
<head>§32. His dictum that ‘the manner of the likeness must follow the manner of the generation’ is
unintelligible.</head>
<p>But to prevent such a thought being entertained, and pretending to be forced somehow
away from it, he says that he withdraws from all these results of Providence, and goes back
to the manner of the Son’s generation, because “the manner of His likeness must follow the
manner of His generation.” What an irresistible proof! How forcibly does this verbiage
compel assent! What skill and precision there is in the wording of this assertion! Then, if
we know the manner of the generation, we shall know by that the manner of the likeness.
Well, then; seeing that all, or at all events most, animals born by parturition have the same
manner of generation, and, according to their logic, the manner of likeness follows this
manner of generation, these animals, following as they do the same model in their production,
will resemble entirely those similarly generated; for things that are like the same thing are
like one another. If, then, according to the view of this heresy, the manner of the generation
makes every thing generated just like itself, and it is a fact that this manner does not vary at
all in diversified kinds of animals but remains the same in the greatest part of them, we shall
find that this sweeping and unqualified assertion of his establishes, by virtue of this similarity
of birth, a mutual resemblance between men, dogs, camels, mice, elephants, leopards, and
every other animal which Nature produces in the same manner. Or does he mean, not, that
things brought into the world in a similar way are all like each other, but that each one of
them is like that being only which is the source of its life. But if so, he ought to have declared
that the child is like the parent, not that the “manner of the likeness” resembles the “manner
of the generation.” But this, which is so probable in itself, and is observed as a fact in Nature,
that the begotten resembles the begetter, he will not admit as a truth; it would reduce his
whole argumentation to a proof of the contrary of what he intended. If he allowed the offspring
to be like the parent, his laboured store of arguments to prove the unlikeness of the
Beings would be refuted as evanescent and groundless.</p>
<p>So he says “the manner of the likeness follows the manner of the generation.” This,
when tested by the exact critic of the meaning of any idea165, will be found completely un-
intelligible. It is plainly impossible to say what a “manner of generation” can mean. Does it
mean the figure of the parent, or his impulse, or his disposition; or the time, or the place,
or the completing of the embryo by conception; or the generative receptacles; or nothing
of that kind, but something else of the things observed in ‘generation.’ It is impossible to
find out what he means. The impropriety and vagueness of the word “manner” causes perplexity
as to its signification here; every possible one is equally open to our surmises, and
presents as well an equal want of connexion with the subject before us. So also with this
phrase of his “manner of likeness;” it is devoid of any vestige of meaning, if we fix our atten-
<note type="footnote">165 ἐννοίας λόγον.</note>

<pb n="147"/>
tion on the examples familiarly known to us. For the thing generated is not to be likened
there to the kind or the manner of its birth. Birth consists, in the case of animal birth, in a
separation of body from body, in which the animal perfectly moulded in the womb is brought
forth; but the thing born is a man, or horse, or cow, or whatever it may chance to be in its
existence through birth. How, therefore, the “manner of the likeness of the offspring follows
the manner of its generation” must be left to him, or to some pupil of his in midwifery, to
explain. Birth is one thing: the thing born is another: they are different ideas altogether. No
one with any sense would deny that what he says is perfectly untrue in the case of animal
births. But if he calls the actual making and the actual fashioning a “manner of the generation,”
which the “manner of the likeness” of the thing produced is to “follow,” even so his
statement is removed from all likelihood, as we shall see from some illustrations. Iron is
hammered out by the blows of the artificer into some useful instrument. How, then, the
outline of its edge, if such there happen to be, can be said to be similar to the hand of the
worker, or to the manner of its fashioning, to the hammers, for instance, and the coals and
the bellows and the anvil by means of which he has moulded it, no one could explain. And
what can be said in one case fits all, where there is any operation producing a result; the
thing produced cannot be said to be like the “manner of its generation.” What has the shape
of a garment got to do with the spool, or the rods, or the comb, or with the form of the
weaver’s instruments at all? What has an actual seat got to do with the working of the blocks;
or any finished production with the build of him who achieved it?—But I think even our
opponents would allow that this rule of his is not in force in sensible and material instances.</p>
<p>It remains to see whether it contributes anything further to the proof of his blasphemy.
What, then, was he aiming at? The necessity of believing in accordance with their being in
the likeness or unlikeness of the Son to the Father; and, as we cannot know about this being
from considerations of Providence, the necessity of having recourse to the “manner of the
generation,” whereby we may know, not indeed whether the Begotten is like the Begetter
(absolutely), but only a certain “manner of likeness” between them; and as this manner is
a secret to the many, the necessity of going at some length into the being of the Begetter.
Then has he forgotten his own definitions about the beings having to be known from their
works? But this begotten being, which he calls the work of the supreme being, has as yet no
light thrown upon it (according to him); so how can its nature be dealt with? And how can
he “mount above this lower and therefore more directly comprehensible thing,” and so cling
to the absolute and supreme being? Again, he always throughout his discourse lays claim
to an accurate knowledge of the divine utterances; yet here he pays them scant reverence,
ignoring the fact that it is not possible to approach to a knowledge of the Father except
through the Son. “No man knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the
Son shall reveal Him166.” Yet Eunomius, while on every occasion, where he can insult our
<note type="footnote">166 Matt. xi. 27.</note>

<pb n="148"/>
devout and God-adoring conceptions of the Son, he asserts in plain words the Son’s inferiority,
establishes His superiority unconsciously in this device of his for knowing the Deity;
for he assumes that the Father’s being lends itself the more readily to our comprehension,
and then attempts to trace and argue out the Son’s nature from that.</p>

<head>§33. He declares falsely that ‘the manner of the generation is to be known from the intrinsic
worth of the generator’.</head>
<p>He goes back, for instance, to the begetting being, and from thence takes a survey of the
begotten; “for,” says he, “the manner of the generation is to be known from the intrinsic
worth of the generator.” Again, we find this bold unqualified generalization of his causing
the thought of the inquirer to be dissipated in every possible direction; it is the nature of
such general statements, to extend in their meanings to every instance, and allow nothing
to escape their sweeping assertion. If then ‘the manner of the generation is to be known
from the intrinsic worth of the generator,’ and there are many differences in the worth of
generators according to their many classifications167 to be found (for one may be born Jew,
Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free), what will be the result? Why, that we must expect
to find as many “manners of generation” as there are differences in intrinsic worth amongst
the generators; and that their birth will not be fulfilled with all in the same way, but that
their nature will vary with the worth of the parent, and that some peculiar manner of birth
will be struck out for each, according to these varying estimations. For a certain inalienable
worth is to be observed in the individual parent; the distinction, that is, of being better or
worse off according as there has fallen to each race, estimation, religion, nationality, power,
servitude, wealth, poverty, independence, dependence, or whatever else constitutes the lifelong
differences of worth. If then “the manner of the generation” is shown by the intrinsic
worth of the parent, and there are many differences in worth, we shall inevitably find, if we
follow this opinion-monger, that the manners of generation are various too; in fact, this
difference of worth will dictate to Nature the manner of the birth.</p>
<p>But if he should not168 admit that such worth is natural, because they can be put in
thought outside the nature of their subject, we will not oppose him. But at all events he will
agree to this; that man’s existence is separated by an intrinsic character from that of brutes.
Yet the manner of birth in these two cases presents no variation in intrinsic character; nature
brings man and the brute into the world in just the same way, i.e. by generation. But if he
apprehends this native dignity only in the case of the most proper and supreme existence,
let us see what he means then. In our view, the ‘native dignity’ of God consists in godhead
itself, wisdom, power, goodness, judgment, justice, strength, mercy, truth, creativeness,

domination, invisibility, everlastingness, and every other quality named in the inspired
writings to magnify his glory; and we affirm that everyone of them is properly and inalienably
found in the Son, recognizing difference only in respect of unoriginateness; and even that
we do not exclude the Son from, according to all its meanings. But let no carping critic attack
this statement as if we were attempting to exhibit the Very Son as ungenerate; for we hold
that one who maintains that is no less impious than an Anomoean. But since the meanings
of ‘origin’ are various, and suggest many ideas, there are some of them in which the title
‘unoriginate’ is not inapplicable to the Son169. When, for instance, this word has the
meaning of ‘deriving existence from no cause whatever,’ then we confess that it is peculiar
to the Father; but when the question is about ‘origin’ in its other meanings (since any creature
or time or order has an origin), then we attribute the being superior to origin to the Son as
well, and we believe that that whereby all things were made is beyond the origin of creation,
and the idea of time, and the sequence of order. So He, Who on the ground of His subsistence
is not without an origin, possessed in every other view an undoubted unoriginateness; and
while the Father is unoriginate and Ungenerate, the Son is unoriginate in the way we have
said, though not ungenerate.</p>
<p>What, then, is that native dignity of the Father which he is going to look at in order to
infer thereby the ‘manner of the generation.’ “His not being generated, most certainly,” he
will reply. If, then, all those names with which we have learnt to magnify God’s glory are
useless and meaningless to you, Eunomius, the mere going through the list of such expressions
is a gratuitous and superfluous task; none of these other words, you say, expresses the
intrinsic worth of the God over all. But if there is a peculiar force fitting our conceptions of
the Deity in each of these words, the intrinsic dignities of God must plainly be viewed in
connexion with this list, and the likeness of the two beings will be thereby proved; if, that
is, the characters inalienable from the beings are an index of the subjects of those characters.
The characters of each being are found to be the same; and so the identity on the score of
being of the two subjects of these identical dignities is shown most clearly. For if the variation
in a single name is to be held to be the index of an alien being, how much more should the
identity of these countless names avail to prove community of nature!</p>
<p>What, then, is the reason why the other names should all be neglected, and generation
be indicated by the means of one alone? Why do they pronounce this ‘Ungeneracy’ to be
the only intrinsic character in the Father, and thrust all the rest aside? It is in order that they
as regards the begotten. But we shall find that this attempt of theirs, when we come to test
it in its proper place, is equally feeble, unfounded, and nugatory as the preceding attempts.</p>

<p>Still, that all his reasonings point this way, is shown by the sequel, in which he praises
himself for having fittingly adopted this method for the proof of his blasphemy, and yet for
not having all at once divulged his intention, nor shocked the unprepared hearer with his
impiety, before the concatenation of his delusive argument was complete, nor displayed
this Ungeneracy as God’s being in the early part of his discourse, nor to weary us with talk
about the difference of being. The following are his exact words: “Or was it right, as Basil
commands, to begin with the thing to be proved, and to assert incoherently that the Ungeneracy
is the being, and to talk about the difference or the sameness of nature?” Upon this
he has a long intervening tirade, made up of scoffs and insulting abuse (such being the
weapons which this thinker uses to defend his own doctrines), and then he resumes the argument,
and turning upon his adversary, fixes upon him, forsooth, the blame of what he is
saying, in these words; “For your party, before any others, are guilty of this offence; having
partitioned out this same being between Begetter and Begotten; and so the scolding you
have given is only a halter not to be eluded which you have woven for your own necks;
justice, as might have been expected, records in your own words a verdict against yourselves.
Either you first conceive of the beings as sundered, and independent of each other171; and
then bring down one of them, by generation, to the rank of Son, and contend that One who
exists independently nevertheless was made by means of the Other existence; and so lay
yourselves open to your own reproaches: for to Him whom you imagine as without generation
you ascribe a generation by another:—or else you first allow one single causeless being, and
then marking this out by an act of causation into Father and Son, you declare that this nongenerated
being came into existence by means of itself.”</p>

<head>§34. The Passage where he attacks the ‘Ομοούσιον, and the contention in answer to it.</head>
<p>I will omit to speak of the words which occur before this passage which has been quoted.
They contain merely shameless abuse of our Master and Father in God, and nothing bearing
on the matter in hand. But on the passage itself, as he advances by the device of this terrible
dilemma a double-edged refutation, we cannot be silent; we must accept the intellectual
challenge, and fight for the Faith with all the power we have, and show that the formidable
two-edged sword which he has sharpened is feebler than a make-believe in a scene-painting.</p>
<p>He attacks the community of substance with two suppositions; he says that we either
name as Father and as Son two independent principles drawn out parallel to each other,
and then say that one of these existencies is produced by the other existence: or else we say
that one and the same essence is conceived of, participating in both names in turn, both
being172 Father, and becoming Son, and itself produced in generation from itself. I put this
in my own words, thereby not misinterpreting his thought, but only correcting the tumid
exaggeration of its expression, in such a way as to reveal his meaning by clearer words and
afford a comprehensive view of it. Having blamed us for want of polish and for having
brought to the controversy an insufficient amount of learning, he decks out his own work
in such a glitter of style, and passes the nail173, to use his own phrase, so often over his own
sentences, and makes his periods so smart with this elaborate prettiness, that he captivates
the reader at once with the attractions of language; such amongst many others is the passage
we have just recited by way of preface. We will, by leave, again recite it. “And so the scolding
you have given is only a halter, not to be eluded, which you have woven for your own necks;
justice, as might have been expected, records in your own words a verdict against yourselves.”</p>
<p>Observe these flowers of the old Attic; what polished brilliance of diction plays over his
composition; what a delicate and subtle charm of style is in bloom there! However, let this
be as people think. Our course requires us again to turn to the thought in those words; let
us plunge once more into the phrases of this pamphleteer. “Either you conceive of the beings
as separated and independent of each other, and then bring down one of them, by generation,
to the rank of Son, and contend that One who exists independently nevertheless was made
by means of the Other existence.” That is enough for the present. He says, then, that we
preach174 two causeless Beings. How can this man, who is always accusing us of levelling
and confusing, assert this from our believing, as we do, in a single substance of Both. If two
natures, alien to each other on the score of their being, were preached by our Faith, just as
it is preached by the Anomoean school, then there would be good reason for thinking that
this distinction of natures led to the supposition of two causeless beings. But if, as is the

<pb n="153"/>
case, we acknowledge one nature with the differences of Person, if, while the Father is believed
in, the Son also is glorified, how can such a Faith be misrepresented by our opponents as
preaching Two First Causes? Then he says, ‘of these two causes, one is lowered’ by us ‘to
the rank of Son.’ Let him point out one champion of such a doctrine; whether he can convict
any single person of talking like this, or only knows of such a doctrine as taught anywhere
at all in the Church, we will hold our peace. For who is so wild in his reasonings, and so
bereft of reflection as, after speaking of Father and Son, to imagine in spite of that two ungenerate
beings: and then again to suppose that the One of them has come into being by
means of the Other? Besides, what logical necessity does he show for pushing our teaching
towards such suppositions? By what arguments does he show that such an absurdity must
result from it? If indeed he adduced one single article of our Faith, and then, whether as a
quibble or with a real force of demonstration, made this criticism upon it, there might have
been some reason for his doing so with a view to invalidate that article. But when there is
not, and never can be such a doctrine in the Church, when neither a teacher of it nor a
hearer of it is to be found, and the absurdity cannot be shown, either, to be the strict logical
consequence of anything, I cannot understand the meaning of his fighting thus with shadows.
It is just as if some phenzy-struck person supposed himself to be grappling with an imaginary
combatant, and then, having with great efforts thrown himself down, thought that it was
his foe who was lying there; our clever pamphleteer is in the same state; he feigns suppositions
which we know nothing about, and he fights with the shadows which are sketched by the
workings of his own brain.</p>
<p>For I challenge him to say why a believer in the Son as having come into being from the
Father must advance to the opinion that there are two First Causes; and let him tell us who
is most guilty of this establishment of two First Causes; one who asserts that the Son is falsely
so named, or one who insists that, when we call Him that, the name represents a reality?
The first, rejecting a real generation of the Son, and affirming simply that He exists, would
be more open to the suspicion of making Him a First Cause, if he exists indeed, but not by
generation: whereas the second, making the representative sign of the Person of the Onlybegotten
to consist in subsisting generatively from the Father, cannot by any possibility be
drawn into the error of supposing the Son to be Ungenerate. And yet as long as, according
to you thinkers, the non-generation of the Son by the Father is to be held, the Son Himself
will be properly called Ungenerate in one of the many meanings of the Ungenerate; seeing
that, as some things come into existence by being born and others by being fashioned,
nothing prevents our calling one of the latter, which does not subsist by generation, an Ungenerate,
looking only to the idea of generation; and this your account, defining, as it does,
our Lord to be a creature, does establish about Him. So, my very learned sirs, it is in your
view, not ours, when it is thus followed out, that the Only-begotten can be named Ungenerate:

<pb n="154"/>
and you will find that “justice,”—whatever you mean by that,—records in your own words175
a verdict against us.</p>
<p>It is easy also to find mud in his words after that to cast upon this execrable teaching.
For the other horn of his dilemma partakes in the same mental delusion; he says, “or else
you first allow one single causeless being, and then marking this out by an act of generation
into Father and Son, you declare that this non-generated being came into existence by means
of itself.” What is this new and marvellous story? How is one begotten by oneself, having
oneself for father, and becoming one’s own son? What dizziness and delusion is here? It is
like supposing the roof to be turning down below one’s feet, and the floor above one’s head;
it is like the mental state of one with his senses stupified with drink, who shouts out persistently
that the ground does not stand still beneath, and that the walls are disappearing, and
that everything he sees is whirling round and will not keep still. Perhaps our pamphleteer
had such a tumult in his soul when he wrote; if so, we must pity him rather than abhor him.
For who is so out of hearing of our divine doctrine, who is so far from the mysteries of the
Church, as to accept such a view as this to the detriment of the Faith. Rather, it is hardly
enough to say, that no one ever dreamed of such an absurdity to its detriment. Why, in the
case of human nature, or any other entity falling within the grasp of the senses who, when
he hears of a community of substance, dreams either that all things that are compared together
on the ground of substance are without a cause or beginning, or that something
comes into existence out of itself, at once producing and being produced by itself?</p>
<p>The first man, and the man born from him, received their being in a different way; the
latter by copulation, the former from the moulding of Christ Himself; and yet, though they
are thus believed to be two, they are inseparable in the definition of their being, and are not
considered as two beings, without beginning or cause, running parallel to each other; nor
can the existing one be said to be generated by the existing one, or the two be ever thought
of as one in the monstrous sense that each is his own father, and his own son; but it is because
the one and the other was a man that the two have the same definition of being; each was
mortal, reasoning, capable of intuition and of science. If, then, the idea of humanity in Adam
and Abel does not vary with the difference of their origin, neither the order nor the manner
of their coming into existence making any difference in their nature, which is the same in
both, according to the testimony of every one in his senses, and no one, not greatly needing
treatment for insanity, would deny it; what necessity is there that against the divine nature
we should admit this strange thought? Having heard of Father and Son from the Truth, we

are taught in those two subjects the oneness of their nature; their natural relation to each
other expressed by those names indicates that nature; and so do Our Lord’s own words. For
when He said, “I and My Father are one176,” He conveys by that confession of a Father exactly
the truth that He Himself is not a first cause, at the same time that He asserts by His union
with the Father their common nature; so that these words of His secure our faith from the
taint of heretical error on either side: for Sabellius has no ground for his confusion of the
individuality of each Person, when the Only-begotten has so distinctly marked Himself off
from the Father in those words, “I and My Father;” and Arius finds no confirmation of his
doctrine of the strangeness of either nature to the other, since this oneness of both cannot
admit distinction in nature. For that which is signified in these words by the oneness of
Father and Son is nothing else but what belongs to them on the score of their actual being;
all the other moral excellences which are to be observed in them as over and above177 their
nature may without error be set down as shared in by all created beings. For instance, Our
Lord is called merciful and pitiful by the prophet178, and He wills us to be and to be called
the same; “Be ye therefore merciful179,” and “Blessed are the merciful180,” and many such
passages. If, then, any one by diligence and attention has modelled himself according to the
divine will, and become kind and pitiful and compassionate, or meek and lowly of heart,
such as many of the saints are testified to have become in the pursuit of such excellences,
does it follow that they are therefore one with God, or united to Him by virtue of any one
of them? Not so. That which is not in every respect the same, cannot be ‘one’ with him whose
nature thus varies from it. Accordingly, a man becomes ‘one’ with another, when in will, as
our Lord says, they are ‘perfected into one181,’ this union of wills being added to the connexion
of nature. So also the Father and Son are one, the community of nature and the community
of will running, in them, into one. But if the Son had been joined in wish only to
the Father, and divided from Him in His nature, how is it that we find Him testifying to His
oneness with the Father, when all the time He was sundered from Him in the point most
proper to Him of all?</p>

<head>§35. Proof that the Anomoean teaching tends to Manichæism.</head>
<p>We hear our Lord saying. “I and My Father are one,” and we are taught in that utterance
the dependence of our Lord on a cause, and yet the absolute identity of the Son’s and the
Father’s nature; we do not let our idea about them be melted down into One Person, but
we keep distinct the properties of the Persons, while, on the other hand, not dividing in the
Persons the oneness of their substance; and so the supposition of two diverse principles in
the category of Cause is avoided, and there is no loophole for the Manichæan heresy to
enter. For the created and the uncreate are as diametrically opposed to each other as their
names are; and so if the two are to be ranked as First Causes, the mischief of Manichæism
will thus under cover be brought into the Church. I say this, because my zeal against our
antagonists makes me scrutinize their doctrine very closely. Now I think that none would
deny that we were bringing this scrutiny very near the truth, when we said, that if the created
be possessed of equal power with the uncreate, there will be some sort of antagonism between
these things of diverse nature, and as long as neither of them fails in power, the two will be
brought into a certain state of mutual discord for we must perforce allow that will corresponds
with, and is intimately joined to nature; and that if two things are unlike in nature, they will
be so also in will. But when power is adequate in both, neither will flag in the gratification
of its wish; and if the power of each is thus equal to its wish, the primacy will become a
doubtful point with the two: and it will end in a drawn battle from the inexhaustibleness of
their powers. Thus will the Manichæan heresy creep in, two opposite principles appearing
with counter claims in the category of Cause, parted and opposed by reason of difference
both in nature and in will. They will find, therefore, that assertion of diminution (in the
Divine being) is the beginning of Manichæism; for their teaching organizes a discord within
that being, which comes to two leading principles, as our account of it has shewn; namely
the created and the uncreated.</p>
<p>But perhaps most will blame this as too strong a reductio ad absurdum, and will wish
that we had not put it down at all along with our other objections. Be it so; we will not contradict
them. It was not our impulse, but our adversaries themselves, that forced us to carry
our argument into such minuteness of results. But if it is not right to argue thus, it was more
fitting still that our opponents’ teaching, which gave occasion to such a refutation, should
never have been heard. There is only one way of suppressing the answer to bad teaching,
and that is, to take away the subject-matter to which a reply has to be made. But what would
give me most pleasure would be to advise those, who are thus disposed, to divest themselves
a little of the spirit of rivalry, and not be such exceedingly zealous combatants on behalf of
the private opinions with which they have become possessed, and convinced that the race
is for their (spiritual) life, to attend to its interests only, and to yield the victory to Truth. If,
then, one were to cease from this ambitious strife, and look straight into the actual question
before us, he would very soon discover the flagrant absurdity of this teaching.</p>

<pb n="157"/>
<p>For let us assume as granted what the system of our opponents demands, that the having
no generation is Being, and in like manner again that generation is admitted into Being. If,
then, one were to follow out carefully these statements in all their meaning, even this way
the Manichæan heresy will be reconstructed seeing that the Manichees are wont to take as
an axiom the oppositions of good and bad, light and darkness, and all such naturally antagonistic
things. I think that any who will not be satisfied with a superficial view of the matter
will be convinced that I say true. Let us look at it thus. Every subject has certain inherent
characteristics, by means of which the specialty of that underlying nature is known. This is
so, whether we are investigating the animal kingdom, or any other. The tree and the animal
are not known by the same marks; nor do the characteristics of man extend in the animal
kingdom to the brutes; nor, again, do the same symptoms indicate life and death; in every
case, without exception, as we have said, the distinction of subjects resists any effort to
confuse them and run one into another; the marks upon each thing which we observe cannot
be communicated so as to destroy that distinction. Let us follow this out in examining our
opponents’ position. They say that the state of having no generation is Being; and they
likewise make the having generation Being. But just as a man and a stone have not the same
marks (in defining the essence of the animate and that of the inanimate you would not give
the same account of each), so they must certainly grant that one who is non-generated is to
be known by different signs to the generated. Let us then survey those peculiar qualities of
the non-generated Deity, which the Holy Scriptures teach us can be mentioned and thought
of, without doing Him an irreverence.</p>
<p>What are they? I think no Christian is ignorant that He is good, kind, holy, just and
hallowed, unseen and immortal, incapable of decay and change and alteration, powerful,
wise, beneficent, Master, Judge, and everything like that. Why lengthen our discussion by
lingering on acknowledged facts? If, then, we find these qualities in the ungenerate nature,
and the state of having been generated is contrary182 in its very conception to the state of
having not been generated, those who define these two states to be each of them Being, must
perforce concede, that the characteristic marks of the generated being, following this opposition
existing between the generated and non-generated, must be contrary to the marks
observable in the non-generated being; for if they were to declare the marks to be the same,
this sameness would destroy the difference between the two beings who are the subject of
these observations. Differing things must be regarded as possessing differing marks; like
things are to be known by like signs. If, then, these men testify to the same marks in the
Only-begotten, they can conceive of no difference whatever in the subject of the marks. But
if they persist in their blasphemous position, and maintain in asserting the difference of the
<note type="footnote">182 ὑπεναντίως, i.e. as logical “contraries” differ from each other. This is not an Aristotelian, but a Neo-Platonic
use of the word (i.e. Ammonius, a.d. 390, U+0026c.). It occurs so again in this Book frequently.</note>

<pb n="158"/>
generated and the non-generated the variation of the natures, it is readily seen what must
result: viz., that, as in following out the opposition of the names, the nature of the things
which those names indicate must be considered to be in a state of contrariety to itself, there
is every necessity that the qualities observed in each should be drawn out opposite each
other; so that those qualities should be applied to the Son which are the reverse of those
predicated of the Father, viz., of divinity, holiness, goodness, imperishability, eternity, and
of every other quality that represents God to the devout mind; in fact, every negation183 of
these, every conception that ranks opposite to the good, must be considered as belonging
to the generated nature.</p>
<p>To ensure clearness, we must dwell upon this point. As the peculiar phænomena of heat
and cold—which are themselves by nature opposed to each other (let us take fire and ice as
examples of each), each being that which the other is not—are at variance with each other,
cooling being the peculiarity of ice, heating of fire; so if in accordance with the antithesis
expressed by the names, the nature revealed by those names is parted asunder, it is not to
be admitted that the faculties attending these natural “subcontraries184” are like each other,
any more than cooling can belong to fire, or burning to ice. If, then, goodness is inseparable
from the idea of the non-generated nature, and that nature is parted on the ground of being,
as they declare, from the generated nature, the properties of the former will be parted as
well from those of the latter: so that if the good is found in the first, the quality set against
the good is to be perceived in the last. Thus, thanks to our clever systematizers, Manes lives
again with his parallel line of evil in array over against the good, and his theory of opposite
powers residing in opposite natures.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we are to speak the truth boldly, without any reserve, Manes, who for having
been the first, they say, to venture to entertain the Manichæan view, gave his name to that
heresy, may fairly be considered the less offensive of the two. I say this, just as if one had to
choose between a viper and an asp for the most affection towards man; still, if we consider,
there is some difference between brutes185. Does not a comparison of doctrines show that
those older heretics are less intolerable than these? Manes thought he was pleading on the
side of the Origin of Good, when he represented that Evil could derive thence none of its
causes; so he linked the chain of things which are on the list of the bad to a separate Principle,
in his character of the Almighty’s champion, and in his pious aversion to put the blame of
any unjustifiable aberrations upon that Source of Good; not perceiving, with his narrow
understanding, that it is impossible even to conceive of God as the fashioner of evil, or on
the other hand, of any other First Principle besides Him. There might be a long discussion
<note type="footnote">183 ἀπεμφαίνοντα</note>
<note type="footnote">184 ὑπεναντίων</note>
<note type="footnote">185 πλὴν ἀλλ᾽ ἐπειδή ἐστι καὶ ἐν θηριοις κρίοις.</note>

<pb n="159"/>
on this point, but it is beside our present purpose. We mentioned Manes’ statements only
in order to show, that he at all events thought it his duty to separate evil from anything to
do with God. But the blasphemous error with regard to the Son, which these men systematize,
is much more terrible. Like the others, they explain the existence of evil by a contrariety in
respect of Being; but when they declare, besides this, that the God of the universe is actually
the Maker of this alien production, and say that this “generation” formed by Him into a
substance possesses a nature foreign to that of its Maker, they exhibit therein more of impiety
than the aforesaid sect; for they not only give a personal existence to that which in its nature
is opposed to good, but they say that a Good Deity is the Cause of another Deity who in
nature diverges from His; and they all but openly exclaim in their teaching, that there is in
existence something opposite to the nature of the good, deriving its personality from the
good itself. For when we know the Father’s substance to be good, and therefore find that
the Son’s substance, owing to its being unlike the Father’s in its nature (which is the tenet
of this heresy), is amongst the contrary predicables, what is thereby proved? Why, not only
that the opposite to the good subsists, but that this contrary comes from the good itself. I
declare this to be more horrible even than the irrationality of the Manichees.</p>
<p>But if they repudiate this blasphemy from their system, though it is the logical carrying
out of their teaching, and if they say that the Only-begotten has inherited the excellences of
the Father, not as being really His Son, but—so does it please these misbelievers—as re
ceiving His personality by an act of creation, let us look into this too, and see whether such
an idea can be reasonably entertained. If, then, it were granted that it is as they think, viz.,
that the Lord of all things has not inherited as being a true Son, but that He rules a kindred
of created things, being Himself made and created, how will the rest of creation accept this
rule and not rise in revolt, being thus thrust down from kinship to subjection and condemned,
though not a whit behind Him in natural prerogative (both being created), to serve and
bend beneath a kinsman after all. That were like a usurpation, viz. not to assign the command
to a superiority of Being, but to divide a creation that retains by right of nature equal privileges
into slaves and a ruling power, one part in command, the other in subjection; as if, as
the result of an arbitrary distribution186, these same privileges had been piled at random
on one who after that distribution got preferred to his equals. Even man did not share his
honour with the brutes, before he received his dominion over them; his prerogative of
reason gave him the title to command; he was set over them, because of a variance of his
nature in the direction of superiority. And human governments experience such quicklyrepeated

make themselves equal with the dominant party, when all are of the same blood.</p>
<p>How, too, will it be true that “all things were made by Him,” if it is true that the Son
Himself is one of the things made? Either He must have made Himself, for that text to be
true, and so this unreasonableness which they have devised to harm our Faith will recoil
with all its force upon themselves; or else, if this is absurdly unnatural, that affirmation that
the whole creation was made by Him will be proved to have no ground to stand on. The
withdrawal of one makes “all” a false statement. So that, from this definition of the Son as
a created being, one of two vicious and absurd alternatives is inevitable; either that He is
not the Author of all created things, seeing that He, who, they insist, is one of those works,
must be withdrawn from the “all;” or else, that He is exhibited as the maker of Himself,
seeing that the preaching that ‘without Him was not anything (made) that was made’ is not
a lie. So much for their teaching.</p>

<head>§36. A passing repetition of the teaching of the Church.</head>
<p>But if a man keeps steadfast to the sound doctrine, and believes that the Son is of the
nature which is divine without admixture, he will find everything in harmony with the
other truths of his religion, viz., that Our Lord is the maker of all things, that He is King of
the universe, set above it not by an arbitrary act of capricious power, but ruling by virtue of
a superior nature; and besides this, he will find that the one First Cause187, as taught by us,
is not divided by any unlikeness of substance into separate first causes, but one Godhead,
one Cause, one Power over all things is believed in, that Godhead being discoverable by the
harmony existing between these like beings, and leading on the mind through one like to
another like, so that the Cause of all things, which is Our Lord, shines in our hearts by means
of the Holy Spirit; (for it is impossible, as the Apostle says, that the Lord Jesus can be truly
known, “except by the Holy Spirit188”); and then all the Cause beyond, which is God over
all, is found through Our Lord, Who is the Cause of all things; nor, indeed, is it possible to
gain an exact knowledge of the Archetypal Good, except as it appears in the (visible) image
of that invisible. But then, after passing that summit of theology, I mean the God over all,
we turn as it were back again in the racecourse of the mind, and speed through conjoint
and kindred ideas from the Father, through the Son, to the Holy Ghost. For once having
taken our stand on the comprehension of the Ungenerate Light, we perceive189 that moment
from that vantage ground the Light that streams from Him, like the ray co-existent with the
sun, whose cause indeed is in the sun, but whose existence is synchronous with the sun, not
being a later addition, but appearing at the first sight of the sun itself: or rather (for there is
no necessity to be slaves to this similitude, and so give a handle to the critics to use against
our teaching by reason of the inadequacy of our image), it will not be a ray of the sun that
we shall perceive, but another sun blazing forth, as an offspring, out of the Ungenerate sun,
and simultaneously with our conception of the First, and in every way like him, in beauty,
in power, in lustre, in size, in brilliance, in all things at once that we observe in the sun. Then
again, we see yet another such Light after the same fashion sundered by no interval of time
from that offspring Light, and while shining forth by means of It yet tracing the source of
its being to the Primal Light; itself, nevertheless, a Light shining in like manner as the one
first conceived of, and itself a source of light and doing all that light does. There is, indeed,

<head>§37. Defence of S. Basil’s statement, attacked by Eunomius, that the terms ‘Father’ and ‘The
Ungenerate’ can have the same meaning.</head>
<p>The stream of his abuse is very strong; insolence is at the bottom of every principle he
lays down; and vilification is put by him in the place of any demonstration of doubtful points
so let us briefly discuss the many misrepresentations about the word Ungenerate with which
he insults our Teacher himself and his treatise. He has quoted the following words of our
Teacher: “For my part I should be inclined to say that this title of the Ungenerate, however
fitting it may seem to express our ideas, yet, as nowhere found in Scripture and as forming
the alphabet of Eunomius’ blasphemy, may very well be suppressed, when we have the word
Father meaning the same thing; for One who essentially and alone is Father comes from
none else; and that which comes from none else is equivalent to the Ungenerate.” Now let
us hear what proof he brings of the ‘folly’ of these words: “Overhastiness and shameless
dishonesty prompt him to put this dose of words190 anomalously used into his attempts;
he turns completely round, because his judgment is wavering and his powers of reasoning
are feeble.” Notice how well-directed that blow is; how skilfully, with all his mastery of logic,
he takes Basil’s words to pieces and puts a conception more consistent with piety in their
place! “Anomalous in phrase,” “hasty and dishonest in judgment,” “wavering and turning
round from feebleness of reasoning.” Why this? what has exasperated this man, whose own
judgment is so firm and reasoning so sound? What is it that he most condemns in Basil’s
words? Is it, that he accepts the idea of the Ungenerate, but says that the actual word, as
misused by those who pervert it, should be suppressed? Well; is the Faith in jeopardy only
as regards words and outward expressions, and need we take no account of the correctness
of the thought beneath? Or does not the Word of Truth rather exhort us first to have a heart
pure from evil thoughts, and then, for the manifestation of the soul’s emotions, to use any
words that can express these secrets of the mind, without any minute care about this or that
particular sound? For the speaking in this way or in that is not the cause of the thought
within us; but the hidden conception of the heart supplies the motive for such and such
words; “for from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” We make the words interpret
the thought; we do not by a reverse process gather191 the thought from the words.
Should both be at hand, a man may certainly be ready in both, in clever thinking and clever
expression; but if the one should be wanting, the loss to the illiterate is slight, if the knowledge
in his soul is perfect in the direction of moral goodness. “This people honoureth me with
their lips, but their heart is far from me192.” What is the meaning of that? That the right
attitude of the soul towards the truth is more precious than the propriety of phrases in the

<pb n="164"/>
sight of God, who hears the “groanings that cannot be uttered.” Phrases can be used in opposite
senses; the tongue readily serving, at his will, the intention of the speaker; but the
disposition of the soul, as it is, so is it seen by Him Who sees all secrets. Why, then, does he
deserve to be called “anomalous,” and “hasty,” and “dishonest,” for bidding us suppress all
in the term Ungenerate which can aid in their blasphemy those who transgress the Faith,
while minding and welcoming all the meaning in the word which can be reverently held. If
indeed he had said that we ought not to think of the Deity as Ungenerate, there might have
been some occasion for these and even worse terms of abuse to be used against him. But if
he falls in with the general belief of the faithful and admits this, and then pronounces an
opinion well worthy of the Master’s mind193, viz., “Refrain from the use of the word, for
into it, and from it, the subverting heresy is fetched,” and bids us cherish the idea of an un-
generate Deity by means of other names,—therein he does not deserve their abuse. Are we
not taught by the Truth Himself to act so, and not to cling even to things exceeding precious,
if any of them tend to mischief? When He thus bids us to cut away the right eye or foot or
hand, if so be that one of them offends, what else does He imply by this figure, than that He
would have anything, however fair-seeming, if it leads a man by an inconsiderate use to evil,
remain inoperative and out of use, assuring us that it is better for us to be saved by amputation
of the parts which led to sin, than to perish by retaining them?</p>
<p>What, too, does Paul, the follower of Christ, say? He, too, in his deep wisdom teaches
the same. He, who declares that “everything is good, and nothing to be rejected, if it be received
with thanks194,” on some occasions, because of the ‘conscience of the weak brother,’
puts some things back from the number which he has accepted, and commands us to decline
them. “If,” he says, “meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
standeth195.” Now this is just what our follower of Paul did. He saw that the deceiving power
of those who try to teach the inequality of the Persons was increased by this word Ungenerate,
taken in their mischievous, heretical sense, and so he advised that, while we cherish in our
souls a devout consciousness of this ungenerate Deity, we should not show any particular
love for the actual word, which was the occasion of sin to the reprobate; for that the title of
Father, if we follow out all that it implies, will suggest to us this meaning of not having been
generated. For when we hear the word Father, we think at once of the Author of all beings;
for if He had some further cause transcending Himself, He would not have been called thus
of proper right Father; for that title would have had to be transferred higher, to this pre-

supposed Cause. But if He Himself is that Cause from which all comes, as the Apostle says,
it is plain that nothing can be thought of beyond His existence. But this is to believe in that
existence not having been generated. But this man, who claims that even the Truth shall
not be considered more persuasive than himself, will not acquiesce in this; he loudly dogmatizes
against it; he jeers at the argument.</p>

<head>§38. Several ways of controverting his quibbling syllogisms.</head>
<p>Let us, if you please, examine his irrefragable syllogisms, and his subtle transpositions196
of the terms in his own false premisses, by which he hopes to shake that argument; though,
indeed, I fear lest the miserable quibbling in what he says may in a measure raise a prejudice
also against the remarks that would correct it. When striplings challenge to a fight, men get
more blame for pugnaciousness in closing with such foes, than honour for their show of
victory. Nevertheless, what we want to say is this. We think, indeed, that the things said by
him, with that well-known elocution now familiar to us, only for the sake of being insolent,
are better buried in silence and oblivion; they may suit him; but to us they afford only an
exercise for much-enduring patience. Nor would it be proper, I think, to insert his ridiculous
expressions in the midst of our own serious controversy, and so to make this zeal for the
truth evaporate in coarse, vulgar laughter; for indeed to be within hearing, and to remain
unmoved, is an impossibility, when he says with such sublime and magnificient verbosity,
“Where additional words amount to additional blasphemy, it is by half as much more
tranquillizing to be silent than to speak.” Let those laugh at these expressions who know
which of them are fit to be believed, and which only to be laughed at; while we scrutinize
the keenness of those syllogisms with which he tries to tear our system to pieces.</p>
<p>He says, “If ‘Father’ is the same in meaning as ‘Ungenerate,’ and words which have the
same meaning naturally have in every respect the same force, and Ungenerate signifies by
their confession that God comes from nothing, it follows necessarily that Father signifies
the fact of God being of none, and not the having generated the Son.” Now what is this logical
necessity which prevents the having generated a Son being signified by the title
“Father,” if so be that that same title does in itself express to us as well the absence of beginning
in the Father? If, indeed, the one idea was totally destructive of the other, it would
certainly follow, from the very nature of contradictories197, that the affirming of the one
<note type="footnote">196 Transpositions of the terms in his own false premises; τῶν σοφισμάτων ἀντιστροφὰς. The same as “the
professional twisting of premisses,” and “the hooking backward and forward and twisting of premisses” below.
The terms Father and ᾽Αγέννητος are transposed or twisted into each other’s place in this ‘irrefragable syllogism.’
It is ‘a reductio ad absurdum’ thus:— Father means ᾽Αγέννητος (Basil’s premiss), 􀀀 ᾽Αγέννητος means Father.
The fallacy of Eunomius consists in making ‘Father’ universal in his own premiss, when it was only particular
in Basil’s. “᾽Αγέννητος means the whole contents of the word Father,” which therefore cannot mean having
generated a son. It is a False Conversion. This Conversion or ἀντιοτροφὴ is illustrated in Aristotle’s Analytics,
Prior. I. iii. 3. It is legitimate thus:— Some B is A 􀀀 Some A is (some) B.</note>
<note type="footnote">197 κατὰ τὴν τῶν ἀντικειμένων φύσιν. If ᾽Αγέννητος means not having a son, then to affirm ‘God is always
᾽Αγέννητος’ is even to deny (its logical contradictory) ‘God once had a Son.’</note>

<pb n="167"/>
would involve the denial of the other. But if there is nothing in the world to prevent the
same Existence from being Father and also Ungenerate, when we try to think, under this
title of Father, of the quality of not having been generated as one of the ideas implied in it,
what necessity prevents the relation to a Son being any longer marked by the word Father?
Other names which express mutual relationship are not always confined to those ideas of
relationship; for instance, we call the emperor198 autocrat and masterless, and we call the
same the ruler of his subjects; and, while it is quite true that the word emperor signifies also
the being masterless, it is not therefore necessary that this word, because signifying autocratic
and unruled, must cease to imply the having power over inferiors; the word emperor, in
fact, is midway between these two conceptions, and at one time indicates masterlessness, at
another the ruling over lower orders. In the case before us, then, if there is some other
Father conceivable besides the Father of Our Lord, let these men who boast of their profound
wisdom show him to us, and then we will agree with him that the idea of the Ungenerate
cannot be represented by the title “Father.” But if the First Father has no cause transcending
His own state, and the subsistence of the Son is invariably implied in the title of Father, why
do they try to scare us, as if we were children, with these professional twistings of premisses,
endeavouring to persuade or rather to decoy us into the belief that, if the property of not
having been generated is acknowledged in the title of Father, we must sever from the Father
any relation with the Son.</p>
<p>Despising, then, this silly superficial attempt of theirs, let us manfully own our belief in
that which they adduce as a monstrous absurdity, viz., that not only does the ‘Father’ mean
the same as Ungenerate and that this last property establishes the Father as being of none,
but also that the word ‘Father’ introduces with itself the notion of the Only-begotten, as a
relative bound to it. Now the following passage, which is to be found in the treatise of our
Teacher, has been removed from the context by this clever and invincible controversialist;
for, by suppressing that part which was added by Basil by way of safeguard, he thought he
would make his own reply a much easier task. The passage runs thus verbatim. “For my
part I should be inclined to say that this title of the Ungenerate, however readily it may seem
to fall in with our own ideas, yet, as nowhere found in Scripture, and as forming the alphabet
of Eunomius’ blasphemy, may very well be suppressed, when we have the word Father
meaning the same thing, in addition to199 its introducing with itself, as a relative bound to
it, the notion of the Son.” This generous champion of the truth, with innate good feeling200,
has suppressed this sentence which was added by way of safeguard, I mean, “in addition to
introducing with itself, as a relative bound to it, the notion of the Son;” after this garbling,
<note type="footnote">198 τὸν βασιλέα.</note>

<note type="footnote">200 ἐλευθερία; late Greek, for ἐλευθεριότης</note>

<pb n="168"/>
he comes to close quarters with what remains, and having severed the connection of the
living whole201, and thus made it, as he thinks, a more yielding and assailable victim of his
logic, he misleads his own party with the frigid and feeble paralogism, that “that which has
a common meaning, in one single point, with something else retains that community of
meaning in every possible point;” and with this he takes their shallow intelligences by storm.
For while we have only affirmed that the word Father in a certain signification yields the
same meaning as Ungenerate, this man makes the coincidence of meanings complete in
every point, quite at variance therein with the common acceptation of either word; and so
he reduces the matter to an absurdity, pretending that this word Father can no longer denote
any relation to the Son, if the idea of not having been generated is conveyed by it. It is just
as if some one, after having acquired two ideas about a loaf,—one, that it is made of flour,
the other, that it is food to the consumer—were to contend with the person who told him
this, using against him the same kind of fallacy as Eunomius does, viz., that ‘the being made
of flour is one thing, but the being food is another; if, then, it is granted that the loaf is made
of flour, this quality in it can no longer strictly be called food.’ Such is the thought in Eunomius’
syllogism; “if the not having been generated is implied by the word Father, this word
can no longer convey the idea of having generated the Son.” But I think it is time that we,
in our turn, applied to this argument of his that magnificently rounded period of his own
(already quoted). In reply to such words, it would be suitable to say that he would have more
claim to be considered in his sober senses, if he had put the limit to such argumentative
safeguards at absolute silence. For “where additional words amount to additional blasphemy,”
or, rather, indicate that he has utterly lost his reason, it is not only “by half as much more,”
but by the whole as much more “tranquillizing to be silent than to speak.”</p>
<p>But perhaps a man would be more easily led into the true view by personal illustrations;
so let us leave this looking backwards and forwards and this twisting of false premisses202,
and discuss the matter in a less learned and more popular way. Your father, Eunomius, was
certainly a human being; but the same person was also the author of your being. Did you,
then, ever use in his case too this clever quibble which you have employed; so that your own
‘father,’ when once he receives the true definition of his being, can no longer mean, because
of being a ‘man,’ any relationship to yourself; ‘for he must be one of two things, either a

man, or Eunomius’ father?’—Well, then, you must not use the names of intimate relationship
otherwise than in accordance with that intimate meaning. Yet, though you would indict for
libel any one who contemptuously scoffed against yourself, by means of such an alteration
of meanings, are you not afraid to scoff against God; and are you safe when you laugh at
these mysteries of our faith? As ‘your father’ indicates relationship to yourself, and at the
same time humanity is not excluded by that term, and as no one in his sober senses instead
of styling him who begat you ‘your father’ would render his description by the word ‘man,’
or, reversely, if asked for his genus and answering ‘man,’ would assert that that answer
prevented him from being your father; so in the contemplation of the Almighty a reverent
mind would not deny that by the title of Father is meant that He is without generation, as
well as that in another meaning it represents His relationship to the Son. Nevertheless Eunomius,
in open contempt of truth, does assert that the title cannot mean the ‘having begotten
a son’ any longer, when once the word has conveyed to us the idea of ‘never having been
generated.’</p>
<p>Let us add the following illustration of the absurdity of his assertions. It is one that all
must be familiar with, even mere children who are being introduced under a grammar-tutor
to the study of words. Who, I say, does not know that some nouns are absolute and out of
all relation, others express some relationship. Of these last, again, there are some which incline,
according to the speaker’s wish, either way; they have a simple intention in themselves,
but can be turned so as to become nouns of relation. I will not linger amongst examples
foreign to our subject. I will explain from the words of our Faith itself.</p>
<p>God is called Father and King and other names innumerable in Scripture. Of these
names one part can be pronounced absolutely, i.e. simply as they are, and no more: viz..
“imperishable,” “everlasting,” “immortal,” and so on. Each of these, without our bringing
in another thought, contains in itself a complete thought about the Deity. Others express
only relative usefulness; thus, Helper, Champion, Rescuer, and other words of that meaning;
if you remove thence the idea of one in need of the help, all the force expressed by the word
is gone. Some, on the other hand, as we have said, are both absolute, and are also amongst
the words of relation; ‘God,’ for instance, and ‘good,’ and many other such. In these the
thought does not continue always within the absolute. The Universal God often becomes
the property of him who calls upon Him; as the Saints teach us, when they make that independent
Being their own. ‘The Lord God is Holy;’ so far there is no relation; but when one
adds the Lord Our God, and so appropriates the meaning in a relation towards oneself, then
one causes the word to be no longer thought of absolutely. Again; “Abba, Father” is the cry
of the Spirit; it is an utterance free from any partial reference. But we are bidden to call the
Father in heaven, ‘Our Father;’ this is the relative use of the word. A man who makes the
Universal Deity his own, does not dim His supreme dignity; and in the same way there is
nothing to prevent us, when we point out the Father and Him who comes from Him, the

<pb n="170"/>
Firstborn before all creation, from signifying by that title of Father at one and the same time
the having begotten that Son, and also the not being from any more transcendent Cause.
For he who speaks of the First Father means Him who is presupposed before all existence,
Whose is the beyond203. This is He, Who has nothing previous to Himself to behold, no
end in which He shall cease. Whichever way we look, He is equally existing there for ever;
He transcends the limit of any end, the idea of any beginning, by the infinitude of His life;
whatever be His title, eternity must be implied with it.</p>
<p>But Eunomius, versed as he is in the contemplation of that which eludes thought, rejects
this view of unscientific minds; he will not admit a double meaning in the word ‘Father,’
the one, that from Him are all things and in the front of all things the Only-begotten Son,
the other, that He Himself has no superior Cause. He may scorn the statement; but we will
brave his mocking laugh, and repeat what we have said already, that the ‘Father’ is the same
as that Ungenerate One, and both signifies the having begotten the Son, and represents the
being from nothing.</p>
<p>But Eunomius, contending with this statement of ours, says (the very contrary now of
what he said before), “If God is Father because He has begotten the Son, and ‘Father’ has
the same meaning as Ungenerate, God is Ungenerate because He has begotten the Son, but
before He begat Him He was not Ungenerate.” Observe his method of turning round; how
he pulls his first quibble to pieces, and turns it into the very opposite, thinking even so to
entrap us in a conclusion from which there is no escape. His first syllogism presented the
following absurdity, “If ‘Father’ means the coming from nothing, then necessarily it will no
longer indicate the having begotten the Son.” But this last syllogism, by turning (a premiss)
into its contrary, threatens our faith with another absurdity. How, then, does he pull to
pieces his former conclusion204? “If He is ‘Father’ because He has begotten a Son.” His first
syllogism gave us nothing like that; on the contrary, its logical inference purported to show
that if the Father’s not having been generated was meant by the word Father, that word
could not mean as well the having begotten a Son205. Thus his first syllogism contained no
<note type="footnote">203 ἐνεδείξατο, οὗ τὸ ἐπέκεινα. This is the reading of the Turin Cod., and preferable to that of the Paris edition.</note>
<note type="footnote">204 The first syllogism was— ‘Father’ means the ‘coming from nothing;’ (‘Coming from nothing’ does not
mean ‘begetting a Son’) 􀀀 Father does not mean begetting a Son. He “pulls to pieces” this conclusion by taking
its logical ‘contrary’ as the first premiss of his second syllogism; thus— Father means begetting a Son; (Father
means ᾽Αγέννητος) 􀀀 ᾽Αγέννητος means begetting a Son. From which it follows that before that begetting the
Almighty was not ᾽Αγέννητος The conclusion of the last syllogism also involves the contrary of the 2nd premiss
of the first. It is to be noticed that both syllogisms are aimed at Basil’s doctrine, ‘Father’ means ‘coming from nothing.’
Eunomius strives to show that, in both, such a premiss leads to an absurdity. But Gregory ridicules both for contradicting
each other.</note>
<note type="footnote">205 τὸ μὲν μὴ δύνασθαι. The negative, absent in Oehler, is recovered from the Turin Cod.</note>

<pb n="171"/>
intimation whatever that God was Father because He had begotten a Son. I fail to understand
what this argumentative and shrewdly professional reversal means.</p>
<p>But let us look to the thought in it below the words. ‘If God is Ungenerate because He
has begotten a Son, He was not Ungenerate before He begat Him.’ The answer to that is
plain; it consists in the simple statement of the Truth that ‘the word Father means both the
having begotten a Son, and also that the Begetter is not to be thought of as Himself coming
from any cause.’ If you look at the effect, the Person of the Son is revealed in the word
Father; if you look for a previous Cause, the absence of any beginning in the Begetter is
shown by that word. In saying that ‘Before He begat a Son, the Almighty was not Ungenerate,’
this pamphleteer lays himself open to a double charge; i.e. of misrepresentation of us, and
of insult to the Faith. He attacks, as if there was no mistake about it, something which our
Teacher never said, neither do we now assert, viz., that the Almighty became in process of
time a Father, having been something else before. Moreover in ridiculing the absurdity of
this fancied doctrine of ours, he proclaims his own wildness as to doctrine. Assuming that
the Almighty was once something else, and then by an advance became entitled to be called
Father, he would have it that before this He was not Ungenerate either, since Ungeneracy
is implied in the idea of Father. The folly of this hardly needs to be pointed out; it will be
abundantly clear to anyone who reflects. If the Almighty was something else before He became
Father, what will the champions of this theory say, if they were asked in what state
they propose to contemplate Him? What name are they going to give Him in that stage of
existence; child, infant, babe, or youth? Will they blush at such flagrant absurdity, and say
nothing like that, and concede that He was perfect from the first? Then how can He be
perfect, while as yet unable to become Father? Or will they not deprive Him of this power,
but say only that it was not fitting that there should be Fatherhood simultaneously with His
existence. But if it was not good nor fitting that He should be from the very beginning
Father of such a Son, how did He go on to acquire that which was not good?</p>
<p>But, as it is, it is good and fitting to God’s majesty that He should become Father of such
a Son. So they will make out that at the beginning He had no share in this good thing, and
as long as He did not have this Son they must assert (may God forgive me for saying it!)
that He had no Wisdom, nor Power, nor Truth, nor any of the other glories which from
various points of view the Only-begotten Son is and is called.</p>
<p>But let all this fall on the heads of those who started it. We will return whence we digressed.
He says, “if God is Father because of having begotten a Son, and if Father means
the being Ungenerate, then God was not this last, before He begat.” Now if he could speak
here as it is customary to speak about human life, where it is inconceivable that any should
acquire possession of many accomplishments all at once, instead of winning each of the

<pb n="172"/>
objects sought after in a certain order and sequence of time—if I say we could reason like
that in the case of the Almighty, so that we could say He possessed His Ungeneracy at one
time, and after that acquired His power, and then His imperishability, and then His Wisdom,
and advancing so became Father, and after that Just and then Everlasting, and so came into
all that enters into the philosophical conception of Him, in a certain sequence—then it
would not be so manifestly absurd to think that one of His names has precedence of another
name, and to talk of His being first Ungenerate, and after that having become Father.</p>
<p>As it is, however, no one is so earth-bound in imagination, so uninitiated in the sublimities
of our Faith, as to fail, when once he has apprehended the Cause of the universe, to
embrace in one collective and compact whole all the attributes which piety can give to God;
and to conceive instead of a primal and a later attribute, and of another in between, supervening
in a certain sequence. It is not possible, in fact, to traverse in thought one amongst
those attributes and then reach another, be it a reality or a conception, which is to transcend
the first in antiquity. Every name of God, every sublime conception of Him, every utterance
or idea that harmonizes with our general ideas with regard to Him, is linked in closest union
with its fellow; all such conceptions are massed together in our understanding into one
collective and compact whole namely, His Fatherhood, and Ungeneracy, and Power, and
Imperishability, and Goodness, and Authority, and everything else. You cannot take one
of these and separate it in thought from the rest by any interval of time, as if it preceded or
followed something else; no sublime or adorable attribute in Him can be discovered, which
is not simultaneously expressed in His everlastingness. Just, then, as we cannot say that God
was ever not good, or powerful, or imperishable, or immortal, in the same way it is a blasphemy
not to attribute to Him Fatherhood always, and to say that that came later. He Who
is truly Father is always Father; if eternity was not included in this confession, and if a
foolishly preconceived idea curtailed and checked retrospectively our conception of the
Father, true Fatherhood could no longer be properly predicated of Him, because that preconceived
idea about the Son would cancel the continuity and eternity of His Fatherhood.
How could that which He is now called be thought of something which came into existence
subsequent to these other attributes? If being first Ungenerate He then became Father, and
received that name, He was not always altogether what He is now called. But that which the
God now existing is He always is; He does not become worse or better by any addition, He
does not become altered by taking something from another source. He is always identical
with Himself. If, then, He was not Father at first, He was not Father afterwards. But if He
is confessed to be Father (now), I will recur to the same argument, that, if He is so now, He
always was so; and that if He always was, He always will be. The Father therefore is always
Father; and seeing that the Son must always be thought of along with the Father (for the
title of father cannot be justified unless there is a son to make it true), all that we contemplate
in the Father is to be observed also in the Son. “All that the Father hath is the Son’s; and all

<pb n="173"/>
that is the Son’s the Father hath.” The words are, ‘The Father hath that which is the Son’s206,’
and so a carping critic will have no authority for finding in the contents of the word “all”
the ungeneracy of the Son, when it is said that the Son has all that the Father has, nor on
the other hand the generation of the Father, when all that is the Son’s is to be observed in
the Father. For the Son has all the things of the Father; but He is not Father: and again, all
the things of the Son are to be observed in the Father, but He is not a Son.</p>
<p>If, then, all that is the Father’s is in the Only-begotten, and He is in the Father, and the
Fatherhood is not dissociated from the ‘not having been generated,’ I for my part cannot
see what there is to think of in connexion with the Father, by Himself, that is parted by any
interval so as to precede our apprehension of the Son. Therefore we may boldly encounter
the difficulties started in that quibbling syllogism; we may despise it as a mere scare to
frighten children, and still assert that God is Holy, and Immortal, and Father, and Ungenerate,
and Everlasting, and everything all at once; and that, if it could be supposed possible that
you could withhold one of these attributes which devotion assigns to Him, all would be
destroyed along with that one. Nothing, therefore, in Him is older or younger; else He would
be found to be older or younger than Himself. If God is not all His attributes always, but
something in Him is, and something else only becoming, following some order of sequence
(we must remember God is not a compound; whatever He is is the whole of Him), and if
according to this heresy He is first Ungenerate and afterwards becomes Father, then, seeing
that we cannot think of Him in connexion with a heaping together of qualities, there is no
alternative but that the whole of Him must be both older and younger than the whole of
Him, the former by virtue of His Ungeneracy, the latter by virtue of His Fatherhood. But
if, as the prophet says of God207, He “is the same,” it is idle to say that before He begat He
was not Himself Ungenerate; we cannot find either of these names, the Father and the Ungenerate
One, parted from the other; the two ideas rise together, suggested by each other,
in the thoughts of the devout reasoner. God is Father from everlasting, and everlasting
Father, and every other term that devotion assigns to Him is given in a like sense, the mensuration
and the flow of time having no place, as we have said, in the Eternal.</p>
<p>Let us now see the remaining results of his expertness in dealing with words; results,
which he himself truly says, are at once ridiculous and lamentable. Truly one must laugh
outright at what he says, if a deep lament for the error that steeps his soul were not more
fitting. Whereas Father, as we teach, includes, according to one of its meanings, the idea of
the Ungenerate, he transfers the full signification of the word Father to that of the Ungenerate,
and declares “If Father is the same as Ungenerate, it is allowable for us to drop it, and use
<note type="footnote">206 John xvi. 15. Oehler conjectures these words (῎Εχει ὁ πατὴρ) are to be repeated; and thus obtains a good
sense, which the common reading, ὁ πατὴρ εἶπον, does not give.</note>

<pb n="174"/>
Ungenerate instead; thus, the Ungenerate of the Son is Ungenerate; for as the Ungenerate
is Father of the Son, so reversely the Father is Ungenerate of the Son.” After this a feeling
of admiration for our friend’s adroitness steals over me, with the conviction that the manysided
subtlety of his theological training is quite beyond the capacity of most. What our
Teacher said was embraced in one short sentence, to the effect that it was possible that by
the title ‘Father’ the Ungeneracy could be signified; but Eunomius’ words depend for their
number not on the variety of the thoughts, but on the way that anything within the circuit
of similar names can be turned about208. As the cattle that run blindfold round to turn the
mill remain with all their travel in the same spot, so does he go round and round the same
topic, and never leaves it. Once he said, ridiculing us, that ‘Father’ does not signify the having
begotten, but the being from nothing. Again he wove a similar dilemma, “If Father signifies
Ungeneracy, before He begat He was not ungenerate.” Then a third time he resorts to the
same trick. “It is allowable for us to drop Father, and to use Ungenerate instead;” and then
directly he repeats the logic so often vomited. “For as the Ungenerate is Father of the Son,
so reversely the Father is Ungenerate of the Son.” How often he returns to his vomit; how
often he blurts it out again! Shall we not, then, annoy most people, if we drag about our argument
in company with this foolish display of words? It would be perhaps more decent to
be silent in a case like this; still, lest any one should think that we decline discussion because
we are weak in pleas, we will answer thus to what he has said. ‘You have no authority, Eunomius,
for calling the Father the Ungenerate of the Son, even though the title Father does
signify that the Begetter was from no cause Himself. For as, to take the example already
cited, when we hear the word ‘Emperor’ we understand two things, both that the one who
is pre-eminent in authority is subject to none, and also that he controls his inferiors, so the
title Father supplies us with two ideas about the Deity, one relating to His Son, the other to
His being dependent on no preconceivable cause. As, then, in the case of ‘Emperor’ we
cannot say that because the two things are signified by that term, viz., the ruling over subjects
and the not having any to take precedence of him, there is any justification for speaking of
the ‘Unruled of subjects,’ instead of the ‘Ruler of the nation,’ or allowing so much, that we
may use such a juxtaposition of words, in imitation of king of a nation, as kingless of a nation,
in the same way when ‘Father’ indicates a Son, and also represents the idea of the Ungenerate,
we may not unduly transfer this latter meaning, so as to attach this idea of the Ungenerate
fast to a paternal relationship, and absurdly say ‘the Ungenerate is Ungenerate of the Son.’</p>
<p>He treads on the ground of truth, he thinks, after such utterances; he has exposed the
absurdity of his adversaries’ position; how boastfully he cries, “And what sane thinker, pray,
ever yet wanted the natural thought to be suppressed, and welcomed the paradoxical?” No
sane thinker, most accomplished sir; and therefore our argument neither, which teaches
<note type="footnote">208 ἐν τῇ περιόδῳ καὶ ἀναστροφῇ τῶν ὁμοίων ῥημάτων.</note>

<pb n="175"/>
that while the term Ungenerate does suit our thoughts, and we ought to guard it in our
hearts intact, yet the term Father is an adequate substitute for the one which you have perverted,
and leads the mind in that direction. Remember the words which you yourself quoted;
Basil did not ‘want the natural thought to be suppressed, and welcome the paradoxical,’ as
you phrase it; but he advised us to avoid all danger by suppressing the mere word Ungenerate,
that is, the expression in so many syllables, as one which had been evilly interpreted, and
besides was not to be found in Scripture; as for its meaning he declares that it does most
completely suit our thoughts.</p>
<p>Thus far for our statement. But this reviler of all quibblers, who completely arms his
own argument with the truth, and arraigns our sins in logic, does not blush in any of his
arguing on doctrines to indulge in very pretty quibbles; on a par with those exquisite jokes
which are cracked to make people laugh at dessert. Reflect on the weight of reasoning displayed
in that complicated syllogism; which I will now again repeat. “If ‘Father’ is the same
as Ungenerate, it is allowable for us to drop it, and use Ungenerate instead; thus, the Ungenerate
is Ungenerate of the Son; for as the Ungenerate is Father of the Son, so, reversely, the
Father is Ungenerate of the Son.” Well, this is very like another case such as the following.
Suppose some one were to state the right and sound view about Adam; namely, that it
mattered not whether we called him “father of mankind” or “the first man formed by God”
(for both mean the same thing), and then some one else, belonging to Eunomius’ school of
reasoners, were to pounce upon this statement, and make the same complication out of it,
viz.: If “first man formed by God” and “father of mankind” are the same things, it is allowable
for us to drop the word “father” and use “first formed” instead; and say that Adam was the
“first formed,” instead of the “father,” of Abel; for as the first formed was the father of a son,
so, reversely, that father is the first formed of that son. If this had been said in a tavern, what
laughter and applause would have broken from the tippling circle over so fine and exquisite
a joke! These are the arguments on which our learned theologian leans; when he assails our
doctrine, he really needs himself a tutor and a stick to teach him that all the things which
are predicated of some one do not necessarily, in their meaning, have respect to one single
object; as is plain from the aforesaid instance of Abel and Adam. That one and the same
Adam is Abel’s father and also God’s handiwork is a truth; nevertheless it does not follow
that, because he is both, he is both with respect to Abel. So the designation of the Almighty
as Father has both the special meaning of that word, i.e., the having begotten a son, and also
that of there being no preconceivable cause of the Very Father; nevertheless it does not follow
that when we mention the Son we must speak of the Ungenerate, instead of the Father, of
that Son; nor, on the other hand, if the absence of beginning remains unexpressed in reference
to the Son, that we must banish from our thoughts about God that attribute of Ungeneracy.
But he discards the usual acceptations, and like an actor in comedy, makes a joke of the
whole subject, and by dint of the oddity of his quibbles makes the questions of our faith ri-

<pb n="176"/>
diculous. Again I must repeat his words: “If Father is the same as Ungenerate, it is allowable
for us to drop it, and use Ungenerate instead; thus, the Ungenerate is Ungenerate of the
Son; for as the Ungenerate is Father of the Son, so, reversely, the Father is Ungenerate of
the Son.” But let us turn the laugh against him, by reversing his quibble; thus: If Father is
not the same as Ungenerate, the Son of the Father will not be Son of the Ungenerate; for
having relation to the Father only, he will be altogether alien in nature to that which is other
than Father, and does not suit that idea; so that, if the Father is something other than the
Ungenerate, and the title Father does not comprehend that meaning, the Son, being One,
cannot be distributed between these two relationships, and be at the same time Son both of
the Father and of the Ungenerate; and, as before it was an acknowledged absurdity to speak
of the Deity as Ungenerate of the Son, so in this converse proposition it will be found an
absurdity just as great to call the Only-begotten Son of the Ungenerate. So that he must
choose one of two things; either the Father is the same as the Ungenerate (which is necessary
in order that the Son of the Father may be Son of the Ungenerate as well); and then our
doctrine has been ridiculed by him without reason; or, the Father is something different to
the Ungenerate, and the Son of the Father is alienated from all relationship to the Ungenerate.
But then, if it is thus to hold that the Only-begotten is not the Son of the Ungenerate, logic
inevitably points to a “generated Father;” for that which exists, but does not exist without
generation, must have a generated substance. If, then, the Father, being according to these
men other than Ungenerate, is therefore generated, where is their much talked of Ungeneracy?
Where is that basis and foundation of their heretical castle-building? The Ungenerate,
which they thought just now that they grasped, has eluded them, and vanished quite beneath
the action of a few barren syllogisms; their would-be demonstration of the Unlikeness, like
a mere dream about something, slips away at the touch of criticism, and takes its flight along
with this Ungenerate.</p>
<p>Thus it is that whenever a falsehood is welcomed in preference to the truth, it may indeed
flourish for a little through the illusion which it creates, but it will soon collapse; its own
methods of proof will dissolve it. But we bring this forward only to raise a smile at the very
pretty revenge we might take on their Unlikeness. We must now resume the main thread of
our discourse.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">  
<pb n="177"/>
<head>§39. Answer to the question he is always asking, “Can He who is be begotten?”</head>
<p>Eunomius does not like the meaning of the Ungenerate to be conveyed by the term
Father, because he wants to establish that there was a time when the Son was not. It is in
fact a constant question amongst his pupils, “How can He who (always) is be begotten?”
This comes, I take it, of not weaning oneself from the human application of words, when
we have to think about God. But let us without bitterness at once expose the actual falseness
of this ‘arrière pensée’ of his209, stating first our conclusions upon the matter.</p>
<p>These names have a different meaning with us, Eunomius; when we come to the transcendent
energies they yield another sense. Wide, indeed, is the interval in all else that divides
the human from the divine; experience cannot point here below to anything at all resembling
in amount what we may guess at and imagine there. So likewise, as regards the meaning of
our terms, though there may be, so far as words go, some likeness between man and the
Eternal, yet the gulf between these two worlds is the real measure of the separation of
meanings. For instance, our Lord calls God a ‘man’ that was a ‘householder’ in the parable210;
but though this title is ever so familiar to us, will the person we think of and the person there
meant be of the same description; and will our ‘house’ be the same as that large house, in
which, as the Apostle says, there are the vessels of gold, and those of silver211, and those of
the other materials which are recounted? Or will not those rather be beyond our immediate
apprehension and to be contemplated in a blessed immortality, while ours are earthern, and
to dissolve to earth? So in almost all the other terms there is a similarity of names between
things human and things divine, revealing nevertheless underneath this sameness a wide
difference of meanings. We find alike in both worlds the mention of bodily limbs and senses;
as with us, so with the life of God, which all allow to be above sense, there are set down in
order fingers and arm and hand, eye and eyelids, hearing, heart, feet and sandals, horses,
cavalry, and chariots; and other metaphors innumerable are taken from human life to illustrate
symbolically divine things. As, then, each one of these names has a human sound, but
not a human meaning, so also that of Father, while applying equally to life divine and human,
hides a distinction between the uttered meanings exactly proportionate to the difference
existing between the subjects of this title. We think of man’s generation one way; we surmise
of the divine generation in another. A man is born in a stated time; and a particular place
must be the receptacle of his life; without it it is not in nature that he should have any concrete
substance: whence also it is inevitable that sections of time are found enveloping his life;
there is a Before, and With, and After him. It is true to say of any one whatever of those
born into this world that there was a time when he was not, that he is now, and again there
<note type="footnote">209 αὐτὸ τὸ πεπλασμενον τῆς ὑπονοιας.</note>
<note type="footnote">210 the parable, i.e. of the Tares. Matthew xiii. 27: cf. v. 52.</note>
<note type="footnote">211 2 Tim. ii. 20.</note>

<pb n="178"/>
will be time when he will cease to exist; but into the Eternal world these ideas of time do
not enter; to a sober thinker they have nothing akin to that world. He who considers what
the divine life really is will get beyond the ‘sometime,’ the ‘before,’ and the ‘after,’ and every
mark whatever of this extension in time; he will have lofty views upon a subject so lofty; nor
will he deem that the Absolute is bound by those laws which he observes to be in force in
human generation.</p>
<p>Passion precedes the concrete existence of man; certain material foundations are laid
for the formation of the living creature; beneath it all is Nature, by God’s will, with her
wonder-working, putting everything under contribution for the proper proportion of nutrition
for that which is to be born, taking from each terrestrial element the amount necessary
for the particular case, receiving the co-operation of a measured time, and as much of the
food of the parents as is necessary for the formation of the child: in a word Nature, advancing
through all these processes by which a human life is built up, brings the non-existent to the
birth; and accordingly we say that, non-existent once, it now is born; because, at one time
not being, at another it begins to be. But when it comes to the Divine generation the mind
rejects this ministration of Nature, and this fulness of time in contributing to the development,
and everything else which our argument contemplated as taking place in human
generation; and he who enters on divine topics with no carnal conceptions will not fall down
again to the level of any of those debasing thoughts, but seeks for one in keeping with the
majesty of the thing to be expressed; he will not think of passion in connexion with that
which is passionless, or count the Creator of all Nature as in need of Nature’s help, or admit
extension in time into the Eternal life; he will see that the Divine generation is to be cleared
of all such ideas, and will allow to the title ‘Father’ only the meaning that the Only-begotten
is not Himself without a source, but derives from That the cause of His being; though, as
for the actual beginning of His subsistence, he will not calculate that, because he will not be
able to see any sign of the thing in question. ‘Older’ and ‘younger’ and all such notions are
found to involve intervals of time; and so, when you mentally abstract time in general, all
such indications are got rid of along with it.</p>
<p>Since, then, He who is with the Father, in some inconceivable category, before the ages
admits not of a ‘sometime,’ He exists by generation indeed, but nevertheless He never begins
to exist. His life is neither in time, nor in place. But when we take away these and all suchlike
ideas in contemplating the subsistence of the Son, there is only one thing that we can even
think of as before Him—i.e. the Father. But the Only-begotten, as He Himself has told us,
is in the Father, and so, from His nature, is not open to the supposition that He ever existed
not. If indeed the Father ever was not, the eternity of the Son must be cancelled retrospectively
in consequence of this nothingness of the Father: but if the Father is always, how can the
Son ever be non-existent, when He cannot be thought of at all by Himself apart from the
Father, but is always implied silently in the name Father. This name in fact conveys the two

<pb n="179"/>
Persons equally; the idea of the Son is inevitably suggested by that word. When was it, then,
that the Son was not? In what category shall we detect His non-existence? In place? There
is none. In time? Our Lord was before all times; and if so, when was He not? And if He was
in the Father, in what place was He not? Tell us that, ye who are so practised in seeing things
out of sight. What kind of interval have your cogitations given a shape to? What vacancy
in the Son, be it of substance or of conception, have you been able to think of, which shows
the Father’s life, when drawn out in parallel, as surpassing that of the Only-begotten? Why,
even of men we cannot say absolutely that any one was not, and then was born. Levi, many
generations before his own birth in the flesh, was tithed by Melchisedech; so the Apostle
says, “Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes (in Abraham),”212 adding the proof, “for
he was yet in the loins of his father, when” Abraham met the priest of the Most High. If,
then, a man in a certain sense is not, and is then born, having existed beforehand by virtue
of kinship of substance in his progenitor, according to an Apostle’s testimony, how as to
the Divine life do they dare to utter the thought that He was not, and then was begotten?
For He ‘is in the Father,’ as our Lord has told us; “I am in the Father, and the Father in
Me213,” each of course being in the other in two different senses; the Son being in the
Father as the beauty of the image is to be found in the form from which it has been outlined;
and the Father in the Son, as that original beauty is to be found in the image of itself. Now
in all hand-made images the interval of time is a point of separation between the model and
that to which it lends its form; but there the one cannot be separated from the other, neither
the “express image” from the “Person,” to use the Apostle’s words214, nor the “brightness”
from the “glory” of God, nor the representation from the goodness; but when once thought
has grasped one of these, it has admitted the associated Verity as well. “Being,” he says (not
becoming), “the brightness of His glory215;” so that clearly we may rid ourselves for ever of
the blasphemy which lurks in either of those two conceptions; viz., that the Only-begotten
can be thought of as Ungenerate (for he says “the brightness of His glory,” the brightness
coming from the glory, and not, reversely, the glory from the brightness); or that He ever
began to be. For the word “being” is a witness that interprets to us the Son’s continuity and
eternity and superiority to all marks of time.</p>
<p>What occasion, then, had our foes for proposing for the damage of our Faith that trifling
question, which they think unanswerable and, so, a proving of their own doctrine, and which
they are continually asking, namely, ‘whether One who is can be generated.’ We may boldly
answer them at once, that He who is in the Ungenerate was generated from Him, and does
<note type="footnote">212 Heb. vii. 9, 10; Genesis xiv. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">213 John x. 38.</note>

<note type="footnote">215 Heb. i. 3. (ὢν, not γενόμενος).</note>

<pb n="180"/>
derive His source from Him. ‘I live by the Father216:’ but it is impossible to name the ‘when’
of His beginning. When there is no intermediate matter, or idea, or interval of time, to
separate the being of the Son from the Father, no symbol can be thought of, either, by which
the Only-begotten can be unlinked from the Father’s life, and shewn to proceed from some
special source of His own. If, then, there is no other principle that guides the Son’s life, if
there is nothing that a devout mind can contemplate before (but not divided from) the
subsistence of the Son, but the Father only; and if the Father is without beginning or generation,
as even our adversaries admit, how can He who can be contemplated only within the
Father, who is without beginning, admit Himself of a beginning?</p>
<p>What harm, too, does our Faith suffer from our admitting those expressions of our opponents
which they bring forward against us as absurd, when they ask ‘whether He which
is can be begotten?’ We do not assert that this can be so in the sense in which Nicodemus
put his offensive question217, wherein he thought it impossible that one who was in existence
could come to a second birth: but we assert that, having His existence attached to an Existence
which is always and is without beginning, and accompanying every investigator into the
antiquities of time, and forestalling the curiosity of thought as it advances into the world
beyond, and intimately blended as He is with all our conceptions of the Father, He has no
beginning of His existence any more than He is Ungenerate: but He was both begotten and
was, evincing on the score of causation generation from the Father, but by virtue of His
everlasting life repelling any moment of non-existence.</p>
<p>But this thinker in his exceeding subtlety contravenes this statement; he sunders the
being of the Only-begotten from the Father’s nature, on the ground of one being Generated,
the other Ungenerate; and although there are such a number of names which with reverence
may be applied to the Deity, and all of them suitable to both Persons equally, he pays no
attention to anyone of them, because these others indicate that in which Both participate;
he fastens on the name Ungenerate, and that alone; and even of this he will not adopt the
usual and approved meaning; he revolutionizes the conception of it, and cancels its common
associations. Whatever can be the reason of this? For without some very strong one he would
not wrest language away from its accepted meaning, and innovate218 by changing the signification
of words. He knows perfectly well that if their meaning was confined to the customary
one he would have no power to subvert the sound doctrine; but that if such terms are perverted
from their common and current acceptation, he will be able to spoil the doctrine
along with the word. For instance (to come to the actual words which he misuses), if, according
to the common thinking of our Faith he had allowed that God was to be called Ungen-

erate only because He was never generated, the whole fabric of his heresy would have collapsed,
with the withdrawal of his quibbling about this Ungenerate. If, that is, he was to be
persuaded, by following out the analogy of almost all the names of God in use for the Church,
to think of the God over all as Ungenerate, just as He is invisible, and passionless, and immaterial;
and if he was agreed that in every one of these terms there was signified only that
which in no way belongs to God—body, for instance, and passion and colour, and derivation
from a cause—then, if his view of the case had been like that, his party’s tenet of the Unlikeness
would lose its meaning; for in all else (except the Ungeneracy) that is conceived concerning
the God of all even these adversaries allow the likeness existing between the Only-begotten
and the Father. But to prevent this, he puts the term Ungenerate in front of all these names
indicating God’s transcendent nature; and he makes this one a vantage-ground from which
he may sweep down upon our Faith; he transfers the contrariety between the actual expressions
‘Generated’ and ‘Ungenerate’ to the Persons themselves to whom these words apply;
and thereby, by this difference between the words he argues by a quibble for a difference
between the Beings; not agreeing with us that Generated is to be used only because the Son
was generated, and Ungenerate because the Father exists without having been generated;
but affirming that he thinks the former has acquired existence by having been generated;
though what sort of philosophy leads him to such a view I cannot understand. If one were
to attend to the mere meanings of those words by themselves, abstracting in thought those
Persons for whom the names are taken to stand, one would discover the groundlessness of
these statements of theirs. Consider, then, not that, in consequence of the Father being a
conception prior to the Son (as the Faith truly teaches), the order of the names themselves
must be arranged so as to correspond with the value and order of that which underlies them;
but regard them alone by themselves, to see which of them (the word, I repeat, not the
Reality which it represents) is to be placed before the other as a conception of our mind;
which of the two conveys the assertion of an idea, which the negation of the same; for instance
(to be clear, I think similar pairs of words will give my meaning), Knowledge, Ignorance—Passion,
Passionlessness—and suchlike contrasts, which of them possess priority of conception
before the others? Those which posit the negation, or those which posit the assertion of the
said quality? I take it the latter do so. Knowledge, anger, passion, are conceived of first; and
then comes the negation of these ideas. And let no one, in his excess of devotion219, blame
this argument, as if it would put the Son before the Father. We are not making out that the
Son is to be placed in conception before the Father, seeing that the argument is discriminating
only the meanings of ‘Generated,’ and ‘Ungenerate.’ So Generation signifies the assertion
of some reality or some idea; while Ungeneracy signifies its negation; so that there is every
reason that Generation must be thought of first. Why, then, do they insist herein on fixing

on the Father the second, in order of conception, of these two names; why do they keep on
thinking that a negation can define and can embrace the whole substance of the term in
question, and are roused to exasperation against those who point out the groundlessness of
their arguments?</p>

<head>§40. His unsuccessful attempt to be consistent with his own statements after Basil has confuted
him.</head>
<p>For notice how bitter he is against one who did detect the rottenness and weakness of
his work of mischief; how he revenges himself all he can, and that is only by abuse and vilification:
in these, however, he possesses abundant ability. Those who would give elegance
of style to a discourse have a way of filling out the places that want rhythm with certain
conjunctive particles220, whereby they introduce more euphony and connexion into the
assembly of their phrases; so does Eunomius garnish his work with abusive epithets in most
of his passages, as though he wished to make a display of this overflowing power of invective.
Again we are ‘fools,’ again we ‘fail in correct reasoning,’ and ‘meddle in the controversy
without the preparation which its importance requires,’ and ‘miss the speaker’s meaning.’
Such, and still more than these, are the phrases used of our Master by this decorous orator.
But perhaps after all there is good reason in his anger; and this pamphleteer is justly indignant.
For why should Basil have stung him by thus exposing the weakness of this teaching
of his? Why should he have uncovered to the sight of the simpler brethren the blasphemy
veiled beneath his plausible sophistries? Why should he not have let silence cover the unsoundness
of this view? Why gibbet the wretched man, when he ought to have pitied him,
and kept the veil over the indecency of his argument? He actually finds out and makes a
spectacle of one who has somehow got to be admired amongst his private pupils for cleverness
and shrewdness! Eunomius had said somewhere in his works that the attribute of being
ungenerate “follows” the deity. Our Master remarked upon this phrase of his that a thing
which “follows” must be amongst the externals, whereas the actual Being is not one of these,
but indicates the very existence of anything, so far as it does exist. Then this gentle yet unconquerable
opponent is furious, and pours along a copious stream of invective, because
our Master, on hearing that phrase, apprehended the sense of it as well. But what did he do
wrong, if he firmly insisted only upon the meaning of your own writings. If indeed he had
seized illogically on what was said, all that you say would be true, and we should have to
<note type="footnote">220 conjunctive particles, σύνδεσμοι. In Aristotle’s Poetics (xx. 6), these are reckoned as one of the 8 ‘parts of

at all events conjunctions and particles. Its general character is defined in his Rhetoric iii. 12, 4: “It makes many
(sentences) one.” Harris (Hermes ii. c. 2), thus defines a conjunction, “A part of speech devoid of signification
itself, but so formed as to help signification by making two or more significant sentences to be one significant
sentence,” a definition which manifestly comes from Aristotle. The comparison here seems to be between these
constantly recurring particles, themselves ‘devoid of signification,’ in an ‘elegant’ discourse, and the perpetually used
epithets, “fools,” U+0026c., which, though utterly meaningless, serve to connect his dislocated paragraphs. The ‘assembly’

the meaning from your actual words, having no comprehension of that which was buried

<head>§41. The thing that follows is not the same as the thing that it follows.</head>
<p>He first says, “the attribute of being ungenerate follows the Deity.” By that we understood
him to mean that this Ungeneracy is one of the things external to God. Then he says, “Or
rather this Ungeneracy is His actual being.” We fail to understand the ‘sequitur’ of this; we
notice in fact something very queer and incongruous about it. If Ungeneracy follows God,
and yet also constitutes His being, two beings will be attributed to one and the same subject
in this view; so that God will be in the same way as He was before and has always been be-
lieved to be222, but besides that will have another being accompanying, which they style
Ungeneracy, quite distinct from Him Whose ‘following’ it is, as our Master puts it. Well, if
he commands us to think so, he must pardon our poverty of ideas, in not being able to follow
out such subtle speculations.</p>
<p>But if he disowns this view, and does not admit a double being in the Deity, one represented
by the godhead, the other by the ungeneracy, let our friend, who is himself neither
‘rash’ nor ‘malignant,’ prevail upon himself not to be over partial to invective while these
combats for the truth are being fought, but to explain to us, who are so wanting in culture,
how that which follows is not one thing and that which leads another, but how both coalesce
into one; for, in spite of what he says in defence of his statement, the absurdity of it remains;
and the addition of that handful of words223 does not correct, as he asserts, the contradiction
in it. I have not yet been able to see that any explanation at all is discoverable in them. But
we will give what he has written verbatim. “We say, ‘or rather the Ungeneracy is His actual
being,’ without meaning to contract into the being224 that which we have proved to follow
it, but applying ‘follow’ to the title, but is to the being.” Accordingly when these things are
taken together, the whole resulting argument would be, that the title Ungenerate follows,
because to be Ungenerate is His actual being. But what expounder of this expounding shall
we get? He says “without meaning to contract into the being that which we have proved to
follow it.” Perhaps some of the guessers of riddles might tell us that by ‘contract into’ he
means ‘fastening together.’ But who can see anything intelligible or coherent in the rest?
The results of ‘following’ belong, he tells us, not to the being, but to the title. But, most
learned sir, what is the title? Is it in discord with the being, or does it not rather coincide
with it in the thinking? If the title is inappropriate to the being, then how can the being be
represented by the title; but if, as he himself phrases it, the being is fittingly defined by the
title of Ungenerate, how can there be any parting of them after that? You make the name

<pb n="186"/>
of the being follow one thing and the being itself another. And what then is the ‘construction
of the entire view?’ “The title Ungenerate follows God, seeing that He Himself is Ungenerate.”
He says that there ‘follows’ God, Who is something other than that which is Ungenerate,
this very title. Then how can he place the definition of Godhead within the Ungeneracy?
Again, he says that this title ‘follows’ God as existing without a previous generation. Who
will solve us the mystery of such riddles? ‘Ungenerate’ preceding and then following; first
a fittingly attached title of the being, and then following like a stranger! What, too, is the
cause or this excessive flutter about this name; he gives to it the whole contents of godhead225;
as if there will be nothing wanting in our adoration, if God be so named; and as if the whole
system of our faith will be endangered, if He is not? Now, if a brief statement about this
should not be deemed superfluous and irrelevant, we will thus explain the matter.</p>
<note type="footnote">225 He gives to it the whole contents of godhead. It was the central point in Eunomius’ system that by the
᾽Αγεννησία we can comprehend the Divine Nature; he trusts entirely to the Aristotelian divisions (logical) and
sub-divisions. A mere word (γέννητος) was thus allowed to destroy the equality of the Son. It was almost inevitable,
therefore, that his opponent, as a defender of the Homoousion, should occasionally fall back so far upon
Plato, as to maintain that opposites are joined and are identical with each other, i.e. that γέννησις and ἀγεννησία
are not truly opposed to each other. Another method of combating this excessive insistence on the physical and
logical was, to bring forward the ethical realities; and this Gregory does constantly throughout this treatise. We
are to know God by Wisdom, and Truth, and Righteousness. Only occasionally (as in the next section) does he
speak of the ‘eternity’ of God: and here only because Eunomius has obliged him, and in order to show that the
idea is made up of two negations, and nothing more.</note>

<head>§42. Explanation of ‘Ungenerate,’ and a ‘study’ of Eternity.</head>
<p>The eternity of God’s life, to sketch it in mere outline, is on this wise. He is always to be
apprehended as in existence; He admits not a time when He was not, and when He will not
be. Those who draw a circular figure in plane geometry from a centre to the distance of the
line of circumference tell us there is no definite beginning to their figure; and that the line
is interrupted by no ascertained end any more than by any visible commencement: they say
that, as it forms a single whole in itself with equal radii on all sides, it avoids giving any indication
of beginning or ending. When, then, we compare the Infinite being to such a figure,
circumscribed though it be, let none find fault with this account; for it is not on the circumference,
but on the similarity which the figure bears to the Life which in every direction
eludes the grasp, that we fix our attention when we affirm that such is our intuition of the
Eternal. From the present instant, as from a centre and a “point,” we extend thought in all
directions, to the immensity of that Life. We find that we are drawn round uninterruptedly
and evenly, and that we are always following a circumference where there is nothing to
grasp; we find the divine life returning upon itself in an unbroken continuity, where no end
and no parts can be recognized. Of God’s eternity we say that which we have heard from
prophecy226; viz.. that God is a king “of old,” and rules for ages, and for ever, and beyond.
Therefore we define Him to be earlier than any beginning, and exceeding any end. Entertaining,
then, this idea of the Almighty, as one that is adequate, we express it by two titles;
i.e., ‘Ungenerate’ and ‘Endless’ represent this infinitude and continuity and ever-lastingness
of the Deity. If we adopted only one of them for our idea, and if the remaining one was
dropped, our meaning would be marred by this omission; for it is impossible with either
one of them singly227 to express the notion residing in each of the two; but when one speaks
of the ‘endless,’ only the absence as regards an end has been indicated, and it does not follow
that any hint has been given about a beginning; while, when one speaks of the ‘Unoriginate228,’
the fact of being beyond a beginning has been expressed, but the case as regards an
end has been left quite doubtful.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that these two titles equally help to express the eternity of the divine life,
it is high time to inquire why our friends cut in two the complete meaning of this eternity,
and declare that the one meaning, which is the negation of beginning, constitutes God’s
being (instead of merely forming part of the definition of eternity229), while they consider
<note type="footnote">226 from prophecy. Psalm x. 16. Βασιλεύσει Κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰU+0026 242·να, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰU+0026 242·να τοῦ αἰU+0026 242·νος·

<pb n="188"/>
the other, which is the negation of end, as amongst the externals of that being. It is difficult
to see the reason for thus assigning the negation of beginning to the realm of being, while
they banish the negation of end outside that realm. The two are our conceptions of the same
thing; and, therefore, either both should be admitted to the definition of being, or, if the
one is to be judged inadmissible, the other should be rejected also. If, however, they are determined
thus to divide the thought of eternity, and to make the one fall within the realm
of that being, and to reckon the other with the non-realities of Deity (for the thoughts which
they adopt on this subject are grovelling, and, like birds who have shed their feathers, they
are unable to soar into the sublimities of theology), I would advise them to reverse their
teaching, and to count the unending as being, overlooking the unoriginate rather, and assigning
the palm to that which is future and excites hope, rather than to that which is past
and stale. Seeing, I say (and I speak thus owing to their narrowness of spirit, and lower the
discussion to the level of a child’s conception), the past period of his life is nothing to him
who has lived it, and all his interest is centred on the future and on that which can be looked
forward to, that which has no end will have more value than that which has no beginning.
So let our thoughts upon the divine nature be worthy and exalted ones; or else, if they are
going to judge of it according to human tests, let the future be more valued by them than
the past, and let them confine the being of the Deity to that, since time’s lapse sweeps away
with it all existence in the past, whereas expected existence gains substance from our hope230.</p>
<p>Now I broach these ridiculously childish suggestions as to children sitting in the marketplace
and playing231; for when one looks into the grovelling earthliness of their heretical
teaching it is impossible to help falling into a sort of sportive childishness. It would be right,
however, to add this to what we have said, viz., that, as the idea of eternity is completed only
by means of both (as we have already argued), by the negation of a beginning and also by
that of an end, if they confine God’s being to the one, their definition of this being will be
manifestly imperfect and curtailed by half; it is thought of only by the absence of beginning,
and does not contain the absence of end within itself as an essential element. But if they do
combine both negations, and so complete their definition of the being of God, observe,
again, the absurdity that is at once apparent in this view; it will be found, after all their efforts,
to be at variance not only with the Only-begotten, but with itself. The case is clear and does
not require much dwelling upon. The idea of a beginning and the idea of an end are opposed
each to each; the meanings of each differ as widely as the other diametric oppositions232,
where there is no half-way proposition below233. If any one is asked to define ‘beginning,’
<note type="footnote">230 Cf. Heb. xi. 1, of faith, ἐλπιζομένων ὑπόστασις πραγμάτων</note>

Thus— A I E</note>

<pb n="189"/>
he will not give a definition the same as that of end; but will carry his definition of it to the
opposite extremity. Therefore also the two contraries234 of these will be separated from each
other by the same distance of opposition; and that which is without beginning, being contrary
to that which is to be seen by a beginning, will be a very different thing from that which is
endless, or the negation of end. If, then, they import both these attributes into the being of
God, I mean the negations of end and of beginning, they will exhibit this Deity of theirs as
a combination of two contradictory and discordant things, because the contrary ideas to
beginning and end reproduce on their side also the contradiction existing between beginning
and end. Contraries of contradictories are themselves contradictory of each other. In fact,
it is always a true axiom, that two things which are naturally opposed to two things mutually
opposite are themselves opposed to each other; as we may see by example. Water is opposed
to fire; therefore also the forces destructive of these are opposed to each other; if moistness
is apt to extinguish fire, and dryness is apt to destroy water, the opposition of fire to water
is continued in those qualities themselves which are contrary to them; so that dryness is
plainly opposed to moistness. Thus, when beginning and end have to be placed (diametrically)
opposite each other235, the terms contrary to these also contradict each other in their
meaning, I mean, the negations of end and of beginning. Well, then, if they determine that
one only of these negations is indicative of the being (to repeat my former assertion), they
will bear evidence to half only of God’s existence, confining it to the absence of beginning,
and refusing to extend it to the absence of end; whereas, if they import both into their
definition of it, they will actually exhibit it so as a combination of contradictions in the way
that has been said; for these two negations of beginning and of end, by virtue of the contradiction
existing between beginning and end, will part it asunder. So their Deity will be found
to be a sort of patchwork compound, a conglomerate of contradictions.</p>
<p>But there is not, neither shall there be, in the Church of God a teaching such as that,
which can make One who is single and incomposite not only multiform and patchwork,
but also the combination of opposites. The simplicity of the True Faith assumes God to be
that which He is, viz., incapable of being grasped by any term, or any idea, or any other
device of our apprehension, remaining beyond the reach not only of the human but of the
angelic and of all supramundane intelligence, unthinkable, unutterable, above all expression
in words, having but one name that can represent His proper nature, the single name of

being ‘Above every name236’; which is granted to the Only-begotten also, because “all that
the Father hath is the Son’s.” The orthodox theory allows these words, I mean “Ungenerate,”
“Endless,” to be indicative of God’s eternity, but not of His being; so that “Ungenerate”
means that no source or cause lies beyond Him, and “Endless” means that His kingdom
will be brought to a standstill in no end. “Thou art the same,” the prophet says, “and Thy
years shall not fail237,” showing by “art” that He subsists out of no cause, and by the words
following, that the blessedness of His life is ceaseless and unending.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, some one amongst even very religious people will pause over these investigations
of ours upon God’s eternity, and say that it will be difficult from what we have said
for the Faith in the Only-begotten to escape unhurt. Of two unacceptable doctrines, he will
say, our account238 must inevitably be brought into contact with one. Either we shall make
out that the Son is Ungenerate, which is absurd; or else we shall deny Him Eternity altogether,
a denial which that fraternity of blasphemers make their specialty. For if Eternity is characterized
by having no beginning and end, it is inevitable either that we must be impious and
deny the Son Eternity, or that we must be led in our secret thoughts about Him into the
idea of Ungeneracy. What, then, shall we answer? That if, in conceiving of the Father before
the Son on the single score of causation, we inserted any mark of time before the subsistence
of the Only-begotten, the belief which we have in the Son’s eternity might with reason be
said to be endangered. But, as it is, the Eternal nature, equally in the case of the Father’s and
the Son’s life, and, as well, in what we believe about the Holy Ghost, admits not of the thought
that it will ever cease to be; for where time is not, the “when” is annihilated with it. And if
the Son, always appearing with the thought of the Father, is always found in the category
of existence, what danger is there in owning the Eternity of the Only-begotten, Who “hath
neither beginning of days, nor end of life239.” For as He is Light from Light, Life from Life,
Good from Good, and Wise, Just, Strong, and all else in the same way, so most certainly is
He Eternal from Eternal.</p>
<p>But a lover of controversial wrangling catches up the argument, on the ground that such
a sequence would make Him Ungenerate from Ungenerate. Let him, however, cool his
combative heart, and insist upon the proper expressions, for in confessing His ‘coming from
the Father’ he has banished all ideas of Ungeneracy as regards the Only-begotten; and there

will be then no danger in pronouncing Him Eternal and yet not Ungenerate. On the one
hand, because the existence of the Son is not marked by any intervals of time, and the infinitude
of His life flows back before the ages and onward beyond them in an all-pervading
tide, He is properly addressed with the title of Eternal; again, on the other hand, because
the thought of Him as Son in fact and title gives us the thought of the Father as inalienably
joined to it, He thereby stands clear of an ungenerate existence being imputed to Him, while
He is always with a Father Who always is, as those inspired words of our Master expressed
it, “bound by way of generation to His Father’s Ungeneracy.” Our account of the Holy Ghost
will be the same also; the difference is only in the place assigned in order. For as the Son is
bound to the Father, and, while deriving existence from Him, is not substantially after Him,
so again the Holy Spirit is in touch with the Only-begotten, Who is conceived of as before
the Spirit’s subsistence only in the theoretical light of a cause240. Extensions in time find no
admittance in the Eternal Life; so that, when we have removed the thought of cause, the
Holy Trinity in no single way exhibits discord with itself; and to It is glory due.</p>

and shared our nature, becoming like us in all things, yet without sin. He was like us in all
things, in that He took upon Him manhood in its entirety with soul and body, so that our
salvation was accomplished by means of both:—He, I say, appeared on earth and “conversed
with men241,” that men might no longer have opinions according to their own notions
about the Self-existent, formulating into a doctrine the hints that come to them from vague
conjectures, but that we might be convinced that God has truly been manifested in the flesh,
and believe that to be the only true “mystery of godliness242,” which was delivered to us by
the very Word and God, Who by Himself spake to His Apostles, and that we might receive
the teaching concerning the transcendent nature of the Deity which is given to us, as it were,
“through a glass darkly243” from the older Scriptures,—from the Law, and the Prophets,
and the Sapiential Books, as an evidence of the truth fully revealed to us, reverently accepting
the meaning of the things which have been spoken, so as to accord in the faith set forth by
the Lord of the whole Scriptures244, which faith we guard as we received it, word for word,
in purity, without falsification, judging even a slight divergence from the words delivered
to us an extreme blasphemy and impiety. We believe, then, even as the Lord set forth the
Faith to His Disciples, when He said, “Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost245.” This is the word of the mystery
whereby through the new birth from above our nature is transformed from the corruptible
to the incorruptible, being renewed from “the old man,” “according to the image of Him
who created246” at the beginning the likeness to the Godhead. In the Faith then which was
delivered by God to the Apostles we admit neither subtraction, nor alteration, nor addition,

<head>§2. Gregory then makes an explanation at length touching the eternal Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit.</head>
<p>Since then this doctrine is put forth by the Truth itself, it follows that anything which
the inventors of pestilent heresies devise besides to subvert this Divine utterance,—as, for
example, calling the Father “Maker” and “Creator” of the Son instead of “Father,” and the
Son a “result,” a “creature,” a “product,” instead of “Son,” and the Holy Spirit the “creature
of a creature,” and the “product of a product,” instead of His proper title the “Spirit,” and
whatever those who fight against God are pleased to say of Him,—all such fancies we term
a denial and violation of the Godhead revealed to us in this doctrine. For once for all we
have learned from the Lord, through Whom comes the transformation of our nature from
mortality to immortality,—from Him, I say, we have learned to what we ought to look with
the eyes of our understanding,—that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We say
that it is a terrible and soul-destroying thing to misinterpret these Divine utterances and to
devise in their stead assertions to subvert them,—assertions pretending to correct God the
Word, Who appointed that we should maintain these statements as part of our faith. For
each of these titles understood in its natural sense becomes for Christians a rule of truth
and a law of piety. For while there are many other names by which Deity is indicated in the
Historical Books, in the Prophets and in the Law, our Master Christ passes by all these and
commits to us these titles as better able to bring us to the faith about the Self-Existent, declaring
that it suffices us to cling to the title, “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,” in order to attain
to the apprehension of Him Who is absolutely Existent, Who is one and yet not one. In regard
to essence He is one, wherefore the Lord ordained that we should look to one Name: but in
regard to the attributes indicative of the Persons, our belief in Him is distinguished into
belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost248; He is divided without separation, and
united without confusion. For when we hear the title “Father” we apprehend the meaning
to be this, that the name is not understood with reference to itself alone, but also by its special
signification indicates the relation to the Son. For the term “Father” would have no meaning
apart by itself, if “Son” were not connoted by the utterance of the word “Father.” When,
then, we learnt the name “Father” we were taught at the same time, by the selfsame title,
faith also in the Son. Now since Deity by its very nature is permanently and immutably the
same in all that pertains to its essence, nor did it at any time fail to be anything that it now
is, nor will it at any future time be anything that it now is not, and since He Who is the very
Father was named Father by the Word, and since in the Father the Son is implied,—since
these things are so, we of necessity believe that He Who admits no change or alteration in
His nature was always entirely what He is now, or, if there is anything which He was not,
<note type="footnote">248 Or, somewhat more literally, “He admits of distinction into belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, being divided,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="195"/>
that He assuredly is not now. Since then He is named Father by the very Word, He assuredly
always was Father, and is and will be even as He was. For surely it is not lawful in speaking
of the Divine and unimpaired Essence to deny that what is excellent always belonged to It.
For if He was not always what He now is, He certainly changed either from the better to the
worse or from the worse to the better, and of these assertions the impiety is equal either
way, whichever statement is made concerning the Divine nature. But in fact the Deity is
incapable of change and alteration. So, then, everything that is excellent and good is always
contemplated in the fountain of excellency. But “the Only-begotten God, Who is in the
bosom of the Father249” is excellent, and beyond all excellency:—mark you, He says, “Who
is in the bosom of the Father,” not “Who came to be” there.</p>
<p>Well then, it has been demonstrated by these proofs that the Son is from all eternity to
be contemplated in the Father, in Whom He is, being Life and Light and Truth, and every
noble name and conception—to say that the Father ever existed by Himself apart from these
attributes is a piece of the utmost impiety and infatuation. For if the Son, as the Scripture
saith, is the Power of God, and Wisdom, and Truth, and Light, and Sanctification, and Peace,
and Life, and the like, then before the Son existed, according to the view of the heretics,
these things also had no existence at all. And if these things had no existence they must
certainly conceive the bosom of the Father to have been devoid of such excellences. To the
end, then, that the Father might not be conceived as destitute of the excellences which are
His own, and that the doctrine might not run wild into this extravagance, the right faith
concerning the Son is necessarily included in our Lord’s utterance with the contemplation
of the eternity of the Father. And for this reason He passes over all those names which are
employed to indicate the surpassing excellence of the Divine nature250, and delivers to us
as part of our profession of faith the title of “Father” as better suited to indicate the truth,
being a title which, as has been said, by its relative sense connotes with itself the Son, while
the Son, Who is in the Father, always is what He essentially is, as has been said already, because
the Deity by Its very nature does not admit of augmentation. For It does not perceive
any other good outside of Itself, by participation in which It could acquire any accession,
but is always immutable, neither casting away what It has, nor acquiring what It has not:
for none of Its properties are such as to be cast away. And if there is anything whatsoever
blessed, unsullied, true and good, associated with Him and in Him, we see of necessity that
<note type="footnote">249 S. John i. 18</note>
<note type="footnote">250 That nature which transcends our conceptions (ὑπερκειμένη).</note>

<pb n="196"/>
the good and holy Spirit must belong to Him251, not by way of accretion. That Spirit is indisputably
a princely Spirit252, a quickening Spirit, the controlling and sanctifying force of
all creation, the Spirit that “worketh all in all” as He wills253. Thus we conceive no gap
between the anointed Christ and His anointing, between the King and His sovereignty,
between Wisdom and the Spirit of Wisdom, between Truth and the Spirit of Truth, between
Power and the Spirit of Power, but as there is contemplated from all eternity in the Father
the Son, Who is Wisdom and Truth, and Counsel, and Might, and Knowledge, and Understanding,
so there is also contemplated in Him the Holy Spirit, Who is the Spirit of Wisdom,
and of Truth, and of Counsel, and of Understanding, and all else that the Son is and is called.
For which reason we say that to the holy disciples the mystery of godliness was committed
in a form expressing at once union and distinction,—that we should believe on the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. For the differentiation of the subsistences254
makes the distinction of Persons255 clear and free from confusion, while the one
Name standing in the forefront of the declaration of the Faith clearly expounds to us the
unity of essence of the Persons256 Whom the Faith declares,—I mean, of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. For by these appellations we are taught not a difference of
nature, but only the special attributes that mark the subsistences257, so that we know that
neither is the Father the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Spirit either the Father
or the Son, and recognize each by the distinctive mark of His Personal Subsistence258, in
illimitable perfection, at once contemplated by Himself and not divided from that with
Which He is connected.</p>

<head>§3. Gregory proceeds to discuss the relative force of the unnameable name of the Holy Trinity
and the mutual relation of the Persons, and moreover the unknowable character of the
essence, and the condescension on His part towards us, His generation of the Virgin, and
His second coming, the resurrection from the dead and future retribution.</head>
<p>What then means that unnameable name concerning which the Lord said, “Baptizing
them into the name,” and did not add the actual significant term which “the name” indicates?
We have concerning it this notion, that all things that exist in the creation are defined by
means of their several names. Thus whenever a man speaks of “heaven” he directs the notion
of the hearer to the created object indicated by this name, and he who mentions “man” or
some animal, at once by the mention of the name impresses upon the hearer the form of
the creature, and in the same way all other things, by means of the names imposed upon
them, are depicted in the heart of him who by hearing receives the appellation imposed
upon the thing. The uncreated Nature alone, which we acknowledge in the Father, and in
the Son, and in the Holy Spirit, surpasses all significance of names. For this cause the Word,
when He spoke of “the name” in delivering the Faith, did not add what it is,—for how could
a name be found for that which is above every name?—but gave authority that whatever
name our intelligence by pious effort be enabled to discover to indicate the transcendent
Nature, that name should be applied alike to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whether it be
“the Good” or “the Incorruptible,” whatever name each may think proper to be employed
to indicate the undefiled Nature of Godhead. And by this deliverance the Word seems to
me to lay down for us this law, that we are to be persuaded that the Divine Essence is ineffable
and incomprehensible: for it is plain that the title of Father does not present to us the Essence,
but only indicates the relation to the Son. It follows, then, that if it were possible for human
nature to be taught the essence of God, He “Who will have all men to be saved and to come
to the knowledge of the truth259” would not have suppressed the knowledge upon this
matter. But as it is, by saying nothing concerning the Divine Essence, He showed that the
knowledge thereof is beyond our power, while when we have learnt that of which we are
capable, we stand in no need of the knowledge beyond our capacity, as we have in the profession
of faith in the doctrine delivered to us what suffices for our salvation. For to learn
that He is the absolutely existent, together with Whom, by the relative force of the term,
there is also declared the majesty of the Son, is the fullest teaching of godliness; the Son, as
has been said, implying in close union with Himself the Spirit of Life and Truth, inasmuch
as He is Himself Life and Truth.</p>
<p>These distinctions being thus established, while we anathematize all heretical fancies
in the sphere of divine doctrines, we believe, even as we were taught by the voice of the Lord,
in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, acknowledging together
<note type="footnote">259 1 Tim. ii. 4.</note>

<pb n="198"/>
with this faith also the dispensation that has been set on foot on behalf of men by the Lord
of the creation. For He “being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with
God, but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant260,” and
being incarnate in the Holy Virgin redeemed us from death “in which we were held,” “sold
under sin261,” giving as the ransom for the deliverance of our souls His precious blood
which He poured out by His Cross, and having through Himself made clear for us the path
of the resurrection262 from the dead, shall come in His own time in the glory of the Father
to judge every soul in righteousness, when “all that are in the graves shall hear His voice,
and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that
have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation263.” But that the pernicious heresy that
is now being sown broadcast by Eunomius may not, by falling upon the mind of some of
the simpler sort and being left without investigation, do harm to guileless faith, we are
constrained to set forth the profession which they circulate and to strive to expose the mischief
of their teaching.</p>

<head>§4. He next skilfully confutes the partial, empty and blasphemous statement of Eunomius on
the subject of the absolutely existent.</head>
<p>Now the wording of their doctrine is as follows: “We believe in the one and only true
God, according to the teaching of the Lord Himself, not honouring Him with a lying title
(for He cannot lie), but really existent, one God in nature and in glory, who is without beginning,
eternally, without end, alone.” Let not him who professes to believe in accordance
with the teaching of the Lord pervert the exposition of the faith that was made concerning
the Lord of all to suit his own fancy, but himself follow the utterance of the truth. Since then,
the expression of the Faith comprehends the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Ghost, what agreement has this construction of theirs to show with the utterances of
the Lord, so as to refer such a doctrine to the teaching of those utterances? They cannot
manage to show where in the Gospels the Lord said that we should believe on “the one and
only true God:” unless they have some new Gospel. For the Gospels which are read in the
churches continuously from ancient times to the present day, do not contain this saying
which tells us that we should believe in or baptize into “the one and only true God,” as these
people say, but “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.” But as we
were taught by the voice of the Lord, this we say, that the word “one” does not indicate the
Father alone, but comprehends in its significance the Son with the Father, inasmuch as the
Lord said, “I and My Father are one264.” In like manner also the name “God” belongs equally
to the Beginning in which the Word was, and to the Word Who was in the Beginning. For
the Evangelist tells us that “the Word was with God, and the Word was God265.” So that
when Deity is expressed the Son is included no less than the Father. Moreover, the true
cannot be conceived as something alien from and unconnected with the truth. But that the
Lord is the Truth no one at all will dispute, unless he be one estranged from the truth. If,
then, the Word is in the One, and is God and Truth, as is proclaimed in the Gospels, on
what teaching of the Lord does he base his doctrine who makes use of these distinctive
terms? For the antithesis is between “only” and “not only,” between “God” and “no God,”
between “true” and “untrue.” If it is with respect to idols that they make their distinction of
phrases, we too agree. For the name of “deity” is given, in an equivocal sense, to the idols
of the heathen, seeing that “all the gods of the heathen are demons,” and in another sense
marks the contrast of the one with the many, of the true with the false, of those who are not
Gods with Him who is God266. But if the contrast is one with the Only-begotten God267,
<note type="footnote">264 S. John x. 30</note>
<note type="footnote">265 S. John i. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">266 Or, possibly, “and the contrast he makes between the one and the many, U+0026c. is irrelevant” (ἄλλως

<pb n="200"/>
let our sages learn that truth has its opposite only in falsehood, and God in one who is not
God. But inasmuch as the Lord Who is the Truth is God, and is in the Father and is one
relatively to the Father268, there is no room in the true doctrine for these distinctions of
phrases. For he who truly believes in the One sees in the One Him Who is completely united
with Him in truth, and deity, and essence, and life, and wisdom, and in all attributes what-
soever: or, if he does not see in the One Him Who is all these it is in nothing that he believes.
For without the Son the Father has neither existence nor name, any more than the Powerful
without Power, or the Wise without Wisdom. For Christ is “the Power of God and the
Wisdom of God269;” so that he who imagines he sees the One God apart from power, truth,
wisdom, life, or the true light, either sees nothing at all or else assuredly that which is evil.
For the withdrawal of the good attributes becomes a positing and origination of evil.</p>
<p>“Not honouring Him,” he says, “with a lying title, for He cannot lie.” By that phrase I
pray that Eunomius may abide, and so bear witness to the truth that it cannot lie. For if he
would be of this mind, that everything that is uttered by the Lord is far removed from
falsehood, he will of course be persuaded that He speaks the truth Who says, “I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me270,”—plainly, the One in His entirety, in the Other in His entirety,
the Father not superabounding in the Son, the Son not being deficient in the Father,—
and Who says also that the Son should be honoured as the Father is honoured271, and
“He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father272,” and “no man knoweth the Father save the
Son273,” in all which passages there is no hint given to those who receive these declarations
as genuine, of any variation274 of glory, or of essence, or anything else, between the Father
and the Son.</p>
<p>“Really existent,” he says, “one God in nature and in glory.” Real existence is opposed
to unreal existence. Now each of existing things is really existent in so far as it is; but that
which, so far as appearance and suggestion go, seems to be, but is not, this is not really existent,
as for example an appearance in a dream or a man in a picture. For these and such
like things, though they exist so far as appearance is concerned, have not real existence. If

then they maintain, in accordance with the Jewish opinion, that the Only-begotten God
does not exist at all, they are right in predicating real existence of the Father alone. But if
they do not deny the existence of the Maker of all things, let them be content not to deprive
of real existence Him Who is, Who in the Divine appearance to Moses gave Himself the
name of Existent, when He said, “I am that I am275:” even as Eunomius in his later argument
agrees with this, saying that it was He Who appeared to Moses. Then he says that God is
“one in nature and in glory.” Whether God exists without being by nature God, he who uses
these words may perhaps know: but if it be true that he who is not by nature God is not God
at all, let them learn from the great Paul that they who serve those who are not Gods do not
serve God276.” But we “serve the living and true God,” as the Apostle says277: and He Whom
we serve is Jesus the Christ278. For Him the Apostle Paul even exults in serving, saying,
“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ279.” We then, who no longer serve them which by nature
are no Gods280, have come to the knowledge of Him Who by nature is God, to Whom every
knee boweth “of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth281.” But
we should not have been His servants had we not believed that this is the living and true
God, to Whom “every tongue maketh confession that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the
Father282.”</p>
<p>“God,” he says, “Who is without beginning, eternally, without end, alone.” Once more
“understand, ye simple ones,” as Solomon says, “his subtlety283,” lest haply ye be deceived
and fall headlong into the denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten Son. That is without
end which admits not of death and decay: that, likewise, is called everlasting which is not
only for a time. That, therefore, which is neither everlasting nor without end is surely seen
in the nature which is perishable and mortal. Accordingly he who predicates “unendingness”
of the one and only God, and does not include the Son in the assertion of “unendingness”
and “eternity,” maintains by such a proposition, that He Whom he thus contrasts with the
eternal and unending is perishable and temporary. But we, even when we are told that God
“only hath immortality284,” understand by “immortality” the Son. For life is immortality,

the true Light, unapproachable by falsehood, is the Only-begotten, in Whom we learn from
the Truth itself that the Father is287. Of these opinions let the reader choose the more devout,

<head>§5. He next marvellously overthrows the unintelligible statements of Eunomius which assert
that the essence of the Father is not separated or divided, and does not become anything
else.</head>
<p>“We believe in God,” he tells us, “not separated as regards the essence wherein He is
one, into more than one, or becoming sometimes one and sometimes another, or changing
from being what He is, or passing from one essence to assume the guise of a threefold personality:
for He is always and absolutely one, remaining uniformly and unchangeably the
only God.” From these citations the discreet reader may well separate first of all the idle
words inserted in the statement without any meaning from those which appear to have
some sense, and afterwards examine the meaning that is discoverable in what remains of
his statement, to ascertain whether it is compatible with due reverence towards Christ.</p>
<p>The first, then, of the statements cited is completely divorced from any intelligible
meaning, good or bad. For what sense there is in the words, “not separated, as regards the
essence wherein He is one, into more than one, or becoming sometimes one and sometimes
another, or changing from being what He is,” Eunomius himself could not tell us, and I do
not think that any of his allies could find in the words any shadow of meaning. When he
speaks of Him as “not separated in regard to the essence wherein He is one,” he says either
that He is not separated from His own essence, or that His own essence is not divided from
Him. This unmeaning statement is nothing but a random combination of noise and empty
sound. And why should one spend time in the investigation of these meaningless expressions?
For how does any one remain in existence when separated from his own essence? or how
is the essence of anything divided and displayed apart? Or how is it possible for one to depart
from that wherein he is, and become another, getting outside himself? But he adds, “not
passing from one essence to assume the guise of three persons: for He is always and absolutely
one, remaining uniformly and unchangeably the only God.” I think the absence of meaning
in his statement is plain to every one without a word from me: against this let any one argue
who thinks there is any sense or meaning in what he says: he who has an eye to discern the
force of words will decline to involve himself in a struggle with unsubstantial shadows. For
what force has it against our doctrine to say “not separated or divided into more than one
as regards the essence wherein He is one, or becoming sometimes one and sometimes another,
or passing from one essence to assume the guise of three persons?”—things that are
neither said nor believed by Christians nor understood by inference from the truths we
confess. For who ever said or heard any one else say in the Church of God, that the Father
is either separated or divided as regards His essence, or becomes sometimes one, sometimes
another, coming to be outside Himself, or assumes the guise of three persons? These things
Eunomius says to himself, not arguing with us but stringing together his own trash, mixing
with the impiety of his utterances a great deal of absurdity. For we say that it is equally impious
and ungodly to call the Lord of the creation a created being and to think that the

<pb n="204"/>
Father, in that He is, is separated or split up, or departs from Himself, or assumes the guise
of three persons, like clay or wax moulded in various shapes.</p>
<p>But let us examine the words that follow: “He is always and absolutely one, remaining
uniformly and unchangeably the only God.” If he is speaking about the Father, we agree
with him, for the Father is most truly one, alone and always absolutely uniform and unchangeable,
never at any time present or future ceasing to be what He is. If then such an
assertion as this has regard to the Father, let him not contend with the doctrine of godliness,
inasmuch as on this point he is in harmony with the Church. For he who confesses that the
Father is always and unchangeably the same, being one and only God, holds fast the word
of godliness, if in the Father he sees the Son, without Whom the Father neither is nor is
named. But if he is inventing some other God besides the Father, let him dispute with the
Jews or with those who are called Hypsistiani, between whom and the Christians there is
this difference, that they acknowledge that there is a God Whom they term the Highest288
or Almighty, but do not admit that he is Father; while a Christian, if he believe not in the
Father, no Christian at all.</p>

<head>§6. He then shows the unity of the Son with the Father and Eunomius’ lack of understanding
and knowledge in the Scriptures.</head>
<p>What he adds next after this is as follows:—“Having no sharer,” he says, “in His Godhead,
no divider of His glory, none who has lot in His power, or part in His royal throne: for He
is the one and only God, the Almighty, God of Gods, King of Kings, Lord of Lords.” I know
not to whom Eunomius refers when he protests that the Father admits none to share His
Godhead with Himself. For if he uses such expressions with reference to vain idols and to
the erroneous conceptions of those who worship them (even as Paul assures us that there
is no agreement between Christ and Belial, and no fellowship between the temple of God
and idols289) we agree with him. But if by these assertions he means to sever the Only-begotten
God from the Godhead of the Father, let him be informed that he is providing us
with a dilemma that may be turned against himself to refute his own impiety. For either he
denies the Only-begotten God to be God at all, that he may preserve for the Father those
prerogatives of deity which (according to him) are incapable of being shared with the Son,
and thus is convicted as a transgressor by denying the God Whom Christians worship, or
if he were to grant that the Son also is God, yet not agreeing in nature with the true God,
he would be necessarily obliged to acknowledge that he maintains Gods sundered from one
another by the difference of their natures. Let him choose which of these he will,—either to
deny the Godhead of the Son, or to introduce into his creed a plurality of Gods. For whichever
of these he chooses, it is all one as regards impiety: for we who are initiated into the mystery
of godliness by the Divinely inspired words of the Scripture do not see between the Father
and the Son a partnership of Godhead, but unity, inasmuch as the Lord hath taught us this
by His own words, when He saith, “I and the Father are one290,” and “he that hath seen Me
hath seen the Father291.” For if He were not of the same nature as the Father, how could He
either have had in Himself that which was different292? or how could He have shown in
Himself that which was unlike, if the foreign and alien nature did not receive the stamp of
that which was of a different kind from itself? But he says, “nor has He a divider of His
glory.” Herein he speaks in accordance with the fact, even though he does not know what
he is saying: for the Son does not divide the glory with the Father, but has the glory of the
Father in its entirety, even as the Father has all the glory of the Son. For thus He spake to
the Father “All Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine293.” Wherefore also He says that He

will appear on the Judgment Day “in the glory of the Father294,” when He will render to
every man according to his works. And by this phrase He shows the unity of nature that
subsists between them. For as “there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the
moon295,” because of the difference between the natures of those luminaries (since if both
had the same glory there would not be deemed to be any difference in their nature), so He
Who foretold of Himself that He would appear in the glory of the Father indicated by the
identity of glory their community of nature.</p>
<p>But to say that the Son has no part in His Father’s royal throne argues an extraordinary
amount of research into the oracles of God on the part of Eunomius, who, after his extreme
devotion to the inspired Scriptures, has not yet heard, “Seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God296,” and many similar passages, of which it
would not be easy to reckon up the number, but which Eunomius has never learnt, and so
denies that the Son is enthroned together with the Father. Again the phrase, “not having lot
in his power,” we should rather pass by as unmeaning than confute as ungodly. For what
sense is attached to the term “having lot” is not easy to discover from the common use of
the word. Those cast lots, as the Scripture tells us, for the Lord’s vesture, who were unwilling
to rend His garment, but disposed to make it over to that one of their number in whose favour
the lot should decide297. They then who thus cast lots among themselves for the “coat” may
be said, perhaps, to “have had lot” in it. But here in the case of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, inasmuch as Their power resides in Their nature (for the Holy Spirit breathes
“where He listeth298,” and “worketh all in all as He will299,” and the Son, by Whom all things
were made, visible and invisible, in heaven and in earth, “did all things whatsoever He
pleased300,” and “quickeneth whom He will301,” and the Father put “the times in His own
power302,” while from the mention of “times” we conclude that all things done in time are
subject to the power of the Father), if, I say, it has been demonstrated that the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit alike are in a position of power to do what They will, it is impossible
to see what sense there can be in the phrase “having lot in His power.” For the heir of all
things, the maker of the ages303, He Who shines with the Father’s glory and expresses in

Himself the Father’s person, has all things that the Father Himself has, and is possessor of
all His power, not that the right is transferred from the Father to the Son, but that it at once
remains in the Father and resides in the Son. For He Who is in the Father is manifestly in
the Father with all His own might, and He Who has the Father in Himself includes all the
power and might of the Father. For He has in Himself all the Father, and not merely a part
of Him: and He Who has Him entirely assuredly has His power as well. With what meaning,
then, Eunomius asserts that the Father has “none who has lot in His power,” those perhaps
can tell who are disciples of his folly: one who knows how to appreciate language confesses
that he cannot understand phrases divorced from meaning. The Father, he says, “has none
Who has lot in His power.” Why, who is there that says that the Father and Son contend
together for power and cast lots to decide the matter? But the holy Eunomius comes as
mediator between them and by a friendly agreement without lot assigns to the Father the
superiority in power.</p>
<p>Mark, I pray you, the absurdity and childishness of this grovelling exposition of his
articles of faith. What! He Who “upholds all things by the word of His power304,” Who says
what He wills to be done, and does what He wills by the very power of that command, He
Whose power lags not behind His will and Whose will is the measure of His power (for “He
spake the word and they were made, He commanded and they were created305”), He Who
made all things by Himself, and made them consist in Himself306, without Whom no existing
thing either came into being or remains in being,—He it is Who waits to obtain His power
by some process of allotment! Judge you who hear whether the man who talks like this is
in his senses. “For He is the one and only God, the Almighty,” he says. If by the title of
“Almighty” he intends the Father, the language he uses is ours, and no strange language:
but if he means some other God than the Father, let our patron of Jewish doctrines preach
circumcision too, if he pleases. For the Faith of Christians is directed to the Father. And the
Father is all these—Highest, Almighty, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and in a word all
terms of highest significance are proper to the Father. But all that is the Father’s is the Son’s
also; so that, on this understanding307, we admit this phrase too. But if, leaving the Father,
he speaks of another Almighty, he is speaking the language of the Jews or following the
speculations of Plato,—for they say that that philosopher also affirms that there exists on
high a maker and creator of certain subordinate gods. As then in the case of the Jewish and
Platonic opinions he who does not believe in God the Father is not a Christian, even though
in his creed he asserts an Almighty God, so Eunomius also falsely pretends to the name of

Christian, being in inclination a Jew, or asserting the doctrines of the Greeks while putting
on the guise of the title borne by Christians. And with regard to the next points he asserts
the same account will apply. He says He is “God of Gods.” We make the declaration our
own by adding the name of the Father, knowing that the Father is God of Gods. But all that
belongs to the Father certainly belongs also to the Son. “And Lord of Lords.” The same account
will apply to this. “And Most High over all the earth.” Yes, for whichever of the Three
Persons you are thinking of, He is Most High over all the earth, inasmuch as the oversight
of earthly things from on high is exercised alike by the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost. So, too, with what follows the words above, “Most High in the heavens, Most High
in the highest, Heavenly, true in being what He is, and so continuing, true in words, true in
works.” Why, all these things the Christian eye discerns alike in the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. If Eunomius does assign them to one only of the Persons acknowledged in the
creed, let him dare to call Him “not true in words” Who has said, “I am the Truth308,” or
to call the Spirit of truth “not true in words,” or let him refuse to give the title of “true in
works” to Him Who doeth righteousness and judgment, or to the Spirit Who worketh all
in all as He will. For if he does not acknowledge that these attributes belong to the Persons
delivered to us in the creed, he is absolutely cancelling the creed of Christians. For how shall
any one think Him a worthy object of faith Who is false in words and untrue in works.</p>
<p>But let us proceed to what follows. “Above all rule, subjection and authority,” he says.
This language is ours, and belongs properly to the Catholic Church,—to believe that the
Divine nature is above all rule, and that it has in subordination to itself everything that can
be conceived among existing things. But the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost constitute
the Divine nature. If he assigns this property to the Father alone, and if he affirms Him alone
to be free from variableness and change, and if he says that He alone is undefiled, the inference
that we are meant to draw is plain, namely, that He who has not these characteristics
is variable, corruptible, subject to change and decay. This, then, is what Eunomius asserts
of the Son and the Holy Spirit: for if he did not hold this opinion concerning the Son and
the Spirit, he would not have employed this opposition, contrasting the Father with them.
For the rest, brethren, judge whether, with these sentiments, he is not a persecutor of the
Christian faith. For who will allow it to be right to deem that a fitting object of reverence
which varies, changes, and is subject to decay? So then the whole aim of one who flames
such notions as these,—notions by which he makes out that neither the Truth nor the
Spirit of Truth is undefiled, unvarying, or unchangeable,—is to expel from the Church the
belief in the Son and in the Holy Spirit.</p>

<head>§7. Gregory further shows that the Only-Begotten being begotten not only of the Father, but
also impassibly of the Virgin by the Holy Ghost, does not divide the substance; seeing that
neither is the nature of men divided or severed from the parents by being begotten, as is
ingeniously demonstrated from the instances of Adam and Abraham.</head>
<p>And now let us see what he adds to his previous statements. “Not dividing,” he says,
“His own essence by begetting, and being at once begetter and begotten, at the same time
Father and Son; for He is incorruptible.” Of such a kind as this, perhaps, is that of which
the prophet says, touching the ungodly, “They weave a spider’s web309.” For as in the cobweb
there is the appearance of something woven, but no substantiality in the appearance,—for
he who touches it touches nothing substantial, as the spider’s threads break with the touch
of a finger,—just such is the unsubstantial texture of idle phrases. “Not dividing His own
essence by begetting and being at once begetter and begotten.” Ought we to give his words
the name of argument, or to call them rather a swelling of humours secreted by some
dropsical inflation? For what is the sense of “dividing His own essence by begetting, and
being at once begetter and begotten?” Who is so distracted, who is so demented, as to make
the statement against which Eunomius thinks he is doing battle? For the Church believes
that the true Father is truly Father of His own Son, as the Apostle says, not of a Son alien
from Him. For thus he declares in one of his Epistles, “Who spared not His own Son310,”
distinguishing Him, by the addition of “own,” from those who are counted worthy of the
adoption of sons by grace and not by nature. But what says He who disparages this belief
of ours? “Not dividing His own essence by begetting, or being at once begetter and begotten,
at the same time Father and Son; for He is incorruptible.” Does one who hears in the Gospel
that the Word was in the beginning, and was God, and that the Word came forth from the
Father, so befoul the undefiled doctrine with these base and fetid ideas, saying “He does not
divide His essence by begetting?” Shame on the abomination of these base and filthy notions!
How is it that he who speaks thus fails to understand that God when manifested in flesh did
not admit for the formation of His own body the conditions of human nature, but was born
for us a Child by the Holy Ghost and the power of the Highest; nor was the Virgin subject
to those conditions, nor was the Spirit diminished, nor the power of the Highest divided?
For the Spirit is entire, the power of the Highest remained undiminished: the Child was
born in the fulness of our nature311, and did not sully the incorruption of His mother. Then
was flesh born of flesh without carnal passion: yet Eunomius will not admit that the
brightness of the glory is from the glory itself, since the glory is neither diminished nor divided
by begetting the light. Again, the word of man is generated from his mind without

<pb n="210"/>
division, but God the Word cannot be generated from the Father without the essence of the
Father being divided! Is any one so witless as not to perceive the irrational character of his
position? “Not dividing,” quoth he, “His own essence by begetting.” Why, whose own essence
is divided by begetting? For in the case of men essence means human nature: in the case of
brutes, it means, generically, brute nature, but in the case of cattle, sheep, and all brute animals,
specifically, it is regarded according to the distinctions of their kinds. Which, then,
of these divides its own essence by the process of generation? Does not the nature always
remain undiminished in the case of every animal by the succession of its posterity? Further
a man in begetting a man from himself does not divide his nature, but it remains in its fulness
alike in him who begets and in him who is begotten, not split off and transferred from the
one to the other, nor mutilated in the one when it is fully formed in the other, but at once
existing in its entirety in the former and discoverable in its entirety in the latter. For both
before begetting his child the man was a rational animal, mortal, capable of intelligence and
knowledge, and also after begetting a man endowed with such qualities: so that in him are
shown all the special properties of his nature; as he does not lose his existence as a man by
begetting the man derived from him, but remains after that event what he was before without
causing any diminution of the nature derived from him by the fact that the man derived
from him comes into being.</p>
<p>Well, man is begotten of man, and the nature of the begetter is not divided. Yet Eunomius
does not admit that the Only-begotten God, Who is in the bosom of the Father, is
truly of the Father, for fear forsooth, lest he should mutilate the inviolable nature of the
Father by the subsistence of the Only-begotten: but after saying “Not dividing His essence
by begetting,” he adds, “Or being Himself begetter and begotten, or Himself becoming
Father and Son312,” and thinks by such loose disjointed phrases to undermine the true
confession of godliness or to furnish some support to his own ungodliness, not being aware
that by the very means he uses to construct a reductio ad absurdum he is discovered to be
an advocate of the truth. For we too say that He who has all that belongs to His own Father
is all that He is, save being Father, and that He who has all that belongs to the Son exhibits
in Himself the Son in His completeness, save being Son: so that the reductio ad absurdum,
which Eunomius here invents, turns out to be a support of the truth, when the notion is
expanded by us so as to display it more clearly, under the guidance of the Gospel. For if “he
that hath seen the Son seeth the Father313” then the Father begat another self, not passing
out of Himself, and at the same time appearing in His fulness in Him: so that from these
considerations that which seemed to have been uttered against godliness is demonstrated
to be a support of sound doctrine.</p>

<pb n="211"/>
<p>But he says, “Not dividing His own essence by begetting, and being at once begetter and
begotten, at the same time Father and Son; for He is incorruptible.” Most cogent conclusion!
What do you mean, most sapient sir? Because He is incorruptible, therefore He does not
divide His own essence by begetting the Son: nor does He beget Himself or be begotten of
Himself, nor become at the same time His own Father and His own Son because He is incorruptible.
It follows then, that if any one is of corruptible nature he divides his essence by
begetting, and is begotten by himself, and begets himself, and is his own father and his own
son, because he is not incorruptible. If this is so, then Abraham, because he was corruptible,
did not beget Ishmael and Isaac, but begat himself by the bondwoman and by his lawful
wife or, to take the other mountebank tricks of the argument, he divided his essence among
the sons who were begotten of him, and first, when Hagar bore him a son, he was divided
into two sections, and in one of the halves became Ishmael, while in the other he remained
half Abraham; and subsequently the residue of the essence of Abraham being again divided
took subsistence in Isaac. Accordingly the fourth part of the essence of Abraham was divided
into the twin sons of Isaac, so that there was an eighth in each of his grandchildren! How
could one subdivide the eighth part, cutting it small in fractions among the twelve Patriarchs,
or among the threescore and fifteen souls with whom Jacob went down into Egypt? And
why do I talk thus when I really ought to confute the folly of such notions by beginning with
the first man? For if it is a property of the incorruptible only not to divide its essence in begetting,
and if Adam was corruptible, to whom the word was spoken, “Dust thou art and
unto dust shalt thou return314,” then, according to Eunomius’ reasoning, he certainly divided
his essence, being cut up among those who were begotten of him, and by reason of the vast
number of his posterity (the slice of his essence which is to be found in each being necessarily
subdivided according to the number of his progeny), the essence of Adam is used up before
Abraham began to subsist, being dispersed in these minute and infinitesimal particles among
the countless myriads of his descendants, and the minute fragment of Adam that has reached
Abraham and his descendants by a process of division, is no longer discoverable in them as
a remnant of his essence, inasmuch as his nature has been already used up among the
countless myriads of those who were before them by its division into infinitesimal fractions.
Mark the folly of him who “understands neither what he says nor whereof he affirms315.”
For by saying “Since He is incorruptible” He neither divides His essence nor begets Himself
nor becomes His own father, he implicitly lays it down that we must suppose all those things
from which he affirms that the incorruptible alone are free to be incidental to generation
in the case of every one who is subject to corruption. Though there are many other considerations
capable of proving the inanity of his argument, I think that what has been said
<note type="footnote">314 Gen. iii. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">315 Cf. 1 Tim. i. 7</note>

<pb n="212"/>
above is sufficient to demonstrate its absurdity. But this has surely been already acknowledged
by all who have an eye for logical consistency, that, when he asserted incorruptibility of the
Father alone, he places all things which are considered after the Father in the category of
corruptible, by virtue of opposition to the incorruptible, so as to make out even the Son not
to be free from corruption. If then he places the Son in opposition to the incorruptible, he
not only defines Him to be corruptible, but also asserts of Him all those incidents from
which he affirms only the incorruptible to be exempt. For it necessarily follows that, if the
Father alone neither begets Himself nor is begotten of Himself, everything which is not in-
corruptible both begets itself and is begotten of itself, and becomes its own father and son,
shifting from its own proper essence to each of these relations. For if to be incorruptible
belongs to the Father alone, and if not to be the things specified is a special property of the
incorruptible, then, of course, according to this heretical argument, the Son is not incorruptible,
and all these circumstances of course, find place about Him,—to have His essence divided,
to beget Himself and to be begotten by Himself, to become Himself His own father
and His own son.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, it is waste of time to linger long over such follies. Let us pass to the
next point of his statement. He adds to what he had already said, “Not standing in need, in
the act of creation, of matter or parts or natural instruments: for He stands in need of
nothing.” This proposition, though Eunomius states it with a certain looseness of phrase,
we yet do not reject as inconsistent with godly doctrine. For learning as we do that “He
spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created316,” we know
that the Word is the Creator of matter, by that very act also producing with the matter the
qualities of matter, so that for Him the impulse of His almighty will was everything and instead
of everything, matter, instrument, place, time, essence, quality, everything that is
conceived in creation. For at one and the same time did He will that that which ought to be
should be, and His power, that produced all things that are, kept pace with His will, turning
His will into act. For thus the mighty Moses in the record of creation instructs us about the
Divine power, ascribing the production of each of the objects that were manifested in the
creation to the words that bade them be. For “God said,” he tells us, “Let there be light, and
there was light317:” and so about the rest, without any mention either of matter or of any
instrumental agency. Accordingly the language of Eunomius on this point is not to be rejected.
For God, when creating all things that have their origin by creation, neither stood in
need of any matter on which to operate, nor of instruments to aid Him in His construction:
for the power and wisdom of God has no need of any external assistance. But Christ is “the
Power of God and the Wisdom of God318,” by Whom all things were made and without
<note type="footnote">316 Ps. cxlviii. 5, or xxxiii. 9 in LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">317 Gen. i. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">318 1 Cor. i. 24.</note>

<pb n="213"/>
Whom is no existent thing, as John testifies319. If, then, all things were made by Him, both
visible and invisible, and if His will alone suffices to effect the subsistence of existing things
(for His will is power), Eunomius utters our doctrine though with a loose mode of expression320.
For what instrument and what matter could He Who upholds all things by the word
of His power321 need in upholding the constitution of existing things by His almighty word?
But if he maintains that what we have believed to be true of the Only-begotten in the case
of the creation, is true also in the case of the Son—in the sense that the Father created Him
in like manner as the creation was made by the Son,—then we retract our former statement,
because such a supposition is a denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten. For we have
learnt from the mighty utterance of Paul that it is the distinguishing feature of idolatry to
worship and serve the creature more than the Creator322, as well as from David, when He
says “There shall no new God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any alien God323.” We
use this line and rule to arrive at the discernment of the object of worship, so as to be convinced
that that alone is God which is neither “new” nor “alien.” Since then we have been
taught to believe that the Only-begotten God is God, we acknowledge, by our belief that He
is God, that He is neither “new” or “alien.” If, then, He is God, He is not “new,” and if He
is not new, He is assuredly eternal. Accordingly, neither is the Eternal “new,” nor is He Who
is of the Father and in the bosom of the Father and Who has the Father in Himself “alien”
from true Deity. Thus he who severs the Son from the nature of the Father either absolutely
disallows the worship of the Son, that he may not worship an alien God, or bows down before
an idol, making a creature and not God the object of his worship, and giving to his idol the
name of Christ.</p>
<p>Now that this is the meaning to which he tends in his conception concerning the Onlybegotten
will become more plain by considering the language he employs touching the
Only-begotten Himself, which is as follows. “We believe also in the Son of God, the Onlybegotten
God, the first-born of all creation, very Son, not ungenerate, verily begotten before
the worlds, named Son not without being begotten before He existed, coming into being

is quite sufficient to render its impiety plain without any investigation on our part. For

though he calls Him “first-born,” yet that he may not raise any doubt in his readers’ minds
as to His not being created, he immediately adds the words, “not uncreate,” lest if the natural
significance of the term “Son” were apprehended by his readers, any pious conception
concerning Him might find place in their minds. It is for this reason that after at first confessing
Him to be Son of God and Only-begotten God, he proceeds at once, by what he adds,
to pervert the minds of his readers from their devout belief to his heretical notions. For he
who hears the titles “Son of God” and “Only-begotten God” is of necessity lifted up to the
loftier kind of assertions respecting the Son, led onward by the significance of these terms,
inasmuch as no difference of nature is introduced by the use of the title “God” and by the
significance of the term “Son.” For how could He Who is truly the Son of God and Himself
God be conceived as something else differing from the nature of the Father? But that godly
conceptions may not by these names be impressed beforehand on the hearts of his readers,
he forthwith calls Him “the first-born of all creation, named Son, not without being begotten
before He existed, coming into being before all creation, not uncreate.” Let us linger a little
while, then, over his argument, that the miscreant may be shown to be holding out his first
statements to people merely as a bait to induce them to receive the poison that he sugars
over with phrases of a pious tendency, as it were with honey. Who does not know how great
is the difference in signification between the term “only-begotten” and “first-born?” For
“first-born” implies brethren, and “only-begotten” implies that there are no other brethren.
Thus the “first-born” is not “only-begotten,” for certainly “first-born” is the first-born among
brethren, while he who is “only-begotten” has no brother: for if he were numbered among
brethren he would not be only-begotten. And moreover, whatever the essence of the
brothers of the first-born is, the same is the essence of the first-born himself. Nor is this all
that is signified by the title, but also that the first-born and those born after him draw their
being from the same source, without the first-born contributing at all to the birth of those
that come after him: so that hereby324 is maintained the falsehood of that statement of John,
which affirms that “all things were made by Him325.” For if He is first-born, He differs from
those born after Him only by priority in time, while there must be some one else by Whom
the power to be at all is imparted alike to Him and to the rest. But that we may not by our
objections give any unfair opponent ground for an insinuation that we do not receive the
inspired utterances of Scripture, we will first set before our readers our own view about
these titles, and then leave it to their judgment which is the better.</p>

<head>§8. He further very appositely expounds the meaning of the term “Only-Begotten,” and of the
term “First born,” four times used by the Apostle.</head>
<p>The mighty Paul, knowing that the Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in
all things326, is the author and cause of all good, bears witness to Him that not only was the
creation of all existent things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man
had decayed and vanished away327, to use his own language, and another new creation was
wrought in Christ, in this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the firstborn
of all that new creation of men which is effected by the Gospel. And that our view
about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on
four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, “first-born of all creation328,”
another time, “the first-born among many brethren329,” again, “first-born from the dead330,”
and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other
words, saying, “But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let
all the angels of God worship Him331.” Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning
this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase
“first-born of all creation.” For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the
meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become “the first-born among
many brethren?” in what sense does He become “the first-born from the dead?” Assuredly
this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, “He Who
for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood332,” purposing to
change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and
the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own
baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are
spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like
to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our
nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the “first-fruits of them that
slept333” and the “first-born from the dead334,” in that He first by His own act loosed the

pains of death335, so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the
pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus,
just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration336 He became “the first-born among
many brethren,” and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He
obtains the name of the “first-born from the dead,” so having in all things the pre-eminence,
after that “all old things,” as the apostle says, “have passed away337,” He becomes the firstborn
of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy
Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming
for us in both alike the Prince of Life338, the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then,
hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, “Go and tell My brethren,
I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God339.” In these words He
sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man. For men revolted from God, and “served
them which by nature were no gods340,” and though being the children of God became attached
to an evil father falsely so called. For this cause the mediator between God and man341
having assumed the first-fruits of all human nature342, sends to His brethren the announcement
of Himself not in His divine character, but in that which He shares with us, saying, “I
am departing in order to make by My own self that true Father, from whom you were separated,
to be your Father, and by My own self to make that true God from whom you had
revolted to be your God, for by that first-fruits which I have assumed, I am in Myself
presenting all humanity to its God and Father.”</p>
<p>Since, then, the first-fruits made the true God to be its God, and the good Father to be
its Father, the blessing is secured for human nature as a whole, and by means of the firstfruits
the true God and Father becomes Father and God of all men. Now “if the first-fruits
be holy, the lump also is holy343.” But where the first-fruits, Christ, is (and the first-fruits
is none other than Christ), there also are they that are Christ’s, as the apostle says. In those
passages therefore where he makes mention of the “first-born” in connexion with other

words, he suggests that we should understand the phrase in the way which I have indicated:
but where, without any such addition, he says, “When again He bringeth the first-born into
the world344,” the addition of “again” asserts that manifestation of the Lord of all which
shall take place at the last day. For as “at the name of Jesus every knee doth bow, of things
in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth345,” although the human name
does not belong to the Son in that He is above every name, even so He says that the Firstborn,
Who was so named for our sakes, is worshipped by all the supramundane creation,
on His coming again into the world, when He “shall judge the world with righteousness
and the people with equity346.” Thus the several meanings of the titles “First-born” and
“Only begotten” are kept distinct by the word of godliness, its respective significance being
secured for each name. But how can he who refers the name of “first-born” to the pre-temporal
existence of the Son preserve the proper sense of the term “Only-begotten”? Let the
discerning reader consider whether these things agree with one another, when the term
“first-born” necessarily implies brethren, and the term “Only-begotten” as necessarily excludes
the notion of brethren. For when the Scripture says, “In the beginning was the
Word347,” we understand the Only-begotten to be meant, and when it adds “the Word was
made flesh348” we thereby receive in our minds the idea of the first-born, and so the word
of godliness remains without confusion, preserving to each name its natural significance,
so that in “Only-begotten” we regard the pre-temporal, and by “the first-born of creation”
the manifestation of the pre-temporal in the flesh.</p>

<head>§9. Gregory again discusses the generation of the Only-Begotten, and other different modes
of generation, material and immaterial, and nobly demonstrates that the Son is the
brightness of the Divine glory, and not a creature.</head>
<p>And now let us return once more to the precise statement of Eunomius. “We believe
also in the Son of God, the only begotten God, the first-born of all creation, very Son, not
Ungenerate, verily begotten before the worlds.” That he transfers, then, the sense of generation
to indicate creation is plain from his expressly calling Him created, when he speaks of Him
as “coming into being” and “not uncreate”. But that the inconsiderate rashness and want
of training which shows itself in the doctrines may be made manifest, let us omit all expressions
of indignation at his evident blasphemy, and employ in the discussion of this matter
a scientific division. For it would be well, I think, to consider in a somewhat careful investigation
the exact meaning of the term “generation.” That this expression conveys the
meaning of existing as the result of some cause is plain to all, and I suppose there is no need
to contend about this point: but since there are different modes of existing as the result of
a cause, this difference is what I think ought to receive thorough explanation in our discussion
by means of scientific division. Of things which have come into being as the results of some
cause we recognize the following differences. Some are the result of material and art, as the
fabrics of houses and all other works produced by means of their respective material, where
some art gives direction and conducts its purpose to its proper aim. Others are the result of
material and nature; for nature orders349 the generation of animals one from another, effecting
her own work by means of the material subsistence in the bodies of the parents; others
again are by material efflux. In these the original remains as it was before, and that which
flows from it is contemplated by itself, as in the case of the sun and its beam, or the lamp
and its radiance, or of scents and ointments, and the quality given off from them. For these,
while remaining undiminished in themselves, have each accompanying them the special
and peculiar effect which they naturally produce, as the sun his ray, the lamp its brightness,
and perfumes the fragrance which they engender in the air. There is also another kind of
generation besides these, where the cause is immaterial and incorporeal, but the generation
is sensible and takes place through the instrumentality of the body; I mean the generation
of the word by the mind. For the mind being in itself incorporeal begets the word by means
of sensible instruments. So many are the differences of the term generation, which we discover
in a philosophic view of them, that is itself, so to speak, the result of generation.</p>
<p>And now that we have thus distinguished the various modes of generation, it will be
time to remark how the benevolent dispensation of the Holy Spirit, in delivering to us the
Divine mysteries, imparts that instruction which transcends reason by such methods as we
can receive. For the inspired teaching adopts, in order to set forth the unspeakable power
<note type="footnote">349 Reading οἰκονομεῖ or οἰκοδομεῖ</note>

<pb n="219"/>
of God, all the forms of generation that human intelligence recognizes, yet without including
the corporeal senses attaching to the words. For when it speaks of the creative power, it
gives to such an energy the name of generation, because its expression must stoop to our
low capacity; it does not, however, convey thereby all that we include in creative generation,
as time, place, the furnishing of matter, the fitness of instruments, the design in the things
that come into being, but it leaves these, and asserts of God in lofty and magnificent language
the creation of all existent things, when it says, “He spake the word and they were made350,
He commanded and they were created.” Again when it interprets to us the unspeakable and
transcendent existence of the Only-begotten from the Father, as the poverty of human intellect
is incapable of receiving doctrines which surpass all power of speech and thought, there
too it borrows our language and terms Him “Son,”—a name which our usage assigns to
those who are born of matter and nature. But just as Scripture, when speaking of generation
by creation, does not in the case of God imply that such generation took place by means of
any material, affirming that the power of God’s will served for material substance, place,
time and all such circumstances, even so here too, when using the term Son, it rejects both
all else that human nature remarks in generation here below,—I mean affections and dispositions
and the co-operation of time, and the necessity of place,—and, above all, matter,
without all which natural generation here below does not take place. But when all such
material, temporal and local351 existence is excluded from the sense of the term “Son,”
community of nature alone is left, and for this reason by the title “Son” is declared, concerning
the Only-begotten, the close affinity and genuineness of relationship which mark His
manifestation from the Father. And since such a kind of generation was not sufficient to
implant in us an adequate notion of the ineffable mode of subsistence of the Only-begotten,
Scripture avails itself also of the third kind of generation to indicate the doctrine of the Son’s
Divinity,—that kind, namely, which is the result of material efflux, and speaks of Him as
the “brightness of glory352,” the “savour of ointment353,” the “breath of God354;” illustrations
which in the scientific phraseology we have adopted we ordinarily designate as material efflux.</p>
<p>But as in the cases alleged neither the birth of the creation nor the force of the term
“Son” admits time, matter, place, or affection, so here too the Scripture employing only the
illustration of effulgence and the others that I have mentioned, apart from all material conception,
with regard to the Divine fitness of such a mode of generation, shows that we must
understand by the significance of this expression, an existence at once derived from and

<pb n="220"/>
subsisting with the Father. For neither is the figure of breath intended to convey to us the
notion of dispersion into the air from the material from which it is formed, nor is the figure
of fragrance designed to express the passing off of the quality of the ointment into the air,
nor the figure of effulgence the efflux which takes place by means of the rays from the body
of the sun: but as has been said in all cases, by such a mode of generation is indicated this
alone, that the Son is of the Father and is conceived of along with Him, no interval intervening
between the Father and Him Who is of the Father. For since of His exceeding loving-kindness
the grace of the Holy Spirit so ordered that the divine conceptions concerning the Onlybegotten
should reach us from many quarters, and so be implanted in us, He added also the
remaining kind of generation,—that, namely, of the word from the mind. And here the
sublime John uses remarkable foresight. That the reader might not through inattention and
unworthy conceptions sink to the common notion of “word,” so as to deem the Son to be
merely a voice of the Father, he therefore affirms of the Word that He essentially subsisted
in the first and blessed nature Itself, thus proclaiming aloud, “In the Beginning was the
Word, and with God, and God, and Light, and Life355,” and all that the Beginning is, the
Word was also.</p>
<p>Since, then, these kinds of generation, those, I mean, which arise as the result of some
cause, and are recognized in our every-day experience, are also employed by Holy Scripture
to convey its teaching concerning transcendent mysteries in such wise as each of them may
reasonably be transferred to the expression of divine conceptions, we may now proceed to
examine Eunomius’ statement also, to find in what sense he accepts the meaning of “generation.”
“Very Son,” he says, “not ungenerate, verily begotten before the worlds.” One may,
I think, pass quickly over the violence done to logical sequence in his distinction, as being
easily recognizable by all. For who does not know that while the proper opposition is between
Father and Son, between generate and ungenerate, he thus passes over the term “Father”
and sets “ungenerate” in opposition to “Son,” whereas he ought, if he had any concern for
truth, to have avoided diverting his phrase from the due sequence of relationship, and to
have said, “Very Son, not Father”? And in this way due regard would have been paid at once
to piety and to logical consistency, as the nature would not have been rent asunder in making
the distinction between the persons. But he has exchanged in his statement of his faith the
true and scriptural use of the term “Father,” committed to us by the Word Himself, and
speaks of the “Ungenerate” instead of the “Father,” in order that by separating Him from
that close relationship towards the Son which is naturally conceived of in the title of Father,
he may place Him on a common level with all created objects, which equally stand in oppos-
<note type="footnote">355 Cf. S. John i. 1 sqq.</note>

<pb n="221"/>
ition to the “ungenerate356.” “Verily begotten,” he says, “before the worlds.” Let him say of
Whom He is begotten. He will answer, of course, “Of the Father,” unless he is prepared
unblushingly to contradict the truth. But since it is impossible to detach the eternity of the
Son from the eternal Father, seeing that the term “Father” by its very signification implies
the Son, for this reason it is that he rejects the title Father and shifts his phrase to “ungenerate,”
since the meaning of this latter name has no sort of relation or connection with the
Son, and by thus misleading his readers through the substitution of one term for the other,
into not contemplating the Son along with the Father, he opens up a path for his sophistry,
paving the way of impiety by slipping in the term “ungenerate.” For they who according to
the ordinance of the Lord believe in the Father, when they hear the name of the Father, receive
the Son along with Him in their thought, as the mind passes from the Son to the Father,
without treading on an unsubstantial vacuum interposed between them. But those who are
diverted to the title “ungenerate” instead of Father, get a bare notion of this name, learning
only the fact that He did not at any time come into being, not that He is Father. Still, even
with this mode of conception, the faith of those who read with discernment remains free
from confusion. For the expression “not to come into being” is used in an identical sense
of all uncreated nature: and Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are equally uncreated. For it has
ever been believed by those who follow the Divine word that all the creation, sensible and
supramundane, derives its existence from the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. He who
has heard that “by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by
the breath of His mouth357,” neither understands by “word” mere utterance, nor by “breath”
mere exhalation, but by what is there said frames the conception of God the Word and of
the Spirit of God. Now to create and to be created are not equivalent, but all existent things
being divided into that which makes and that which is made, each is different in nature
from the other, so that neither is that uncreated which is made, nor is that created which
effects the production of the things that are made. By those then who, according to the exposition
of the faith given us by our Lord Himself, have believed in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, it is acknowledged that each of these Persons is alike
unoriginate358, and the meaning conveyed by “ungenerate” does no harm to their sound
<note type="footnote">356 That is, by using as the terms of his antithesis, not “Son” and “Father,” but “Son” and “Ungenerate,” he
avoids suggesting relationship between the two Persons, and does suggest that the Second Person stands in the
same opposition to the First Person in which all created objects stand as contrasted with Him.</note>
<note type="footnote">357 Ps. xxxiii. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">358 τὀ μὴ γενέσθαι τι τούτων ἐπίσης ὁμολογεῖται. This may possibly mean “it is acknowledged that each of
those alternatives” (viz. that that which comes into being is uncreate, and that that which creates should itself
be created) “is equally untrue.” But this view would not be confined to those who held the Catholic doctrine:
the impossibility of the former alternative, indeed, was insisted upon by the Arians as an argument in their own
favour.</note>

<pb n="222"/>
belief: but to those who are dense and indefinite this term serves as a starting-point for deflection
from sound doctrine. For not understanding the true force of the term, that “ungenerate”
signifies nothing more than “not having come into being,” and that “not coming into
being” is a common property of all that transcends created nature, they drop their faith in
the Father, and substitute for “Father” the phrase “ungenerate:” and since, as has been said,
the Personal existence of the Only-begotten is not connoted in this name, they determine
the existence of the Son to have commenced from some definite beginning in time, affirming
(what Eunomius here adds to his previous statements) that He is called Son not without
generation preceding His existence.</p>
<p>What is this vain juggling with words? Is he aware that it is God of Whom he speaks,
Who was in the beginning and is in the Father, nor was there any time when He was not?
He knows not what he says nor whereof he affirms359, but he endeavours, as though he were
constructing the pedigree of a mere man, to apply to the Lord of all creation the language
which properly belongs to our nature here below. For, to take an example, Ishmael was not
before the generation that brought him into being, and before his birth there was of course
an interval of time. But with Him Who is “the brightness of glory360,” “before” and “after”
have no place: for before the brightness, of course neither was there any glory, for concurrently
with the existence of the glory there assuredly beams forth its brightness; and it is
impossible in the nature of things that one should be severed from the other, nor is it possible
to see the glory by itself before its brightness. For he who says thus will make out the glory
in itself to be darkling and dim, if the brightness from it does not shine out at the same time.
But this is the unfair method of the heresy, to endeavour, by the notions and terms employed
concerning the Only-begotten God, to displace Him from His oneness with the Father. It
is to this end they say, “Before the generation that brought Him into being He was not Son:”
but the “sons of rams361,” of whom the prophet speaks,—are not they too called sons after
coming into being? That quality, then, which reason notices in the “sons of rams,” that they
are not “sons of rams” before the generation which brings them into being,—this our reverend
divine now ascribes to the Maker of the worlds and of all creation, Who has the Eternal
Father in Himself, and is contemplated in the eternity of the Father, as He Himself says, “I
am in the Father, and the Father in Me362.” Those, however, who are not able to detect the
sophistry that lurks in his statement, and are not trained to any sort of logical perception,
follow these inconsequent statements and receive what comes next as a logical consequence
of what preceded. For he says, “coming into being before all creation,” and as though this

were not enough to prove his impiety, he has a piece of profanity in reserve in the phrase
that follows, when he terms the Son “not uncreate.” In what sense then does he call Him
Who is not uncreate “very Son”? For if it is meet to call Him Who is not uncreate “very
Son,” then of course the heaven is “very Son;” for it too is “not uncreate.” So the sun too is
“very Son,” and all that the creation contains, both small and great, are of course entitled
to the appellation of “very Son.” And in what sense does He call Him Who has come into
being “Only-begotten”? For all things that come into being are unquestionably in brotherhood
with each other, so far, I mean, as their coming into being is concerned. And from whom
did He come into being? For assuredly all things that have ever come into being did so from
the Son. For thus did John testify, saying, “All things were made by Him363.” If then the
Son also came into being, according to Eunomius’ creed, He is certainly ranked in the class
of things which have come into being. If then all things that came into being were made by
Him, and the Word is one of the things that came into being, who is so dull as not to draw
from these premises the absurd conclusion that our new creed-monger makes out the Lord
of creation to have been His own work, in saying in so many words that the Lord and Maker
of all creation is “not uncreate”? Let him tell us whence he has this boldness of assertion.
From what inspired utterance? What evangelist, what apostle ever uttered such words as
these? What prophet, what lawgiver, what patriarch, what other person of all who were divinely
moved by the Holy Ghost, whose voices are preserved in writing, ever originated
such a statement as this? In the tradition of the faith delivered by the Truth we are taught
to believe in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If it were right to believe that the Son was created,
how was it that the Truth in delivering to us this mystery bade us believe in the Son, and
not in the creature? and how is it that the inspired Apostle, himself adoring Christ, lays it
down that they who worship the creature besides the Creator are guilty of idolatry364? For,
were the Son created, either he would not have worshipped Him, or he would have refrained
from classing those who worship the creature along with idolaters, lest he himself should
appear to be an idolater, in offering adoration to the created. But he knew that He Whom
he adored was God over all365, for so he terms the Son in his Epistle to the Romans. Why
then do those who divorce the Son from the essence of the Father, and call Him creature,
bestow on Him in mockery the fictitious title of Deity, idly conferring on one alien from
true Divinity the name of “God,” as they might confer it on Bel or Dagon or the Dragon?
Let those, therefore, who affirm that He is created, acknowledge that He is not God at all,

<head>§10. He explains the phrase “The Lord created Me,” and the argument about the origination
of the Son, the deceptive character of Eunomius’ reasoning, and the passage which says,
“My glory will I not give to another,” examining them from different points of view.</head>
<p>But of course they bring forward the passage in the book of Proverbs which says, “The
Lord created Me as the beginning of His ways, for His works366.” Now it would require a
lengthy discussion to explain fully the real meaning of the passage: still it would be possible
even in a few words to convey to well-disposed readers the thought intended. Some of those
who are accurately versed in theology do say this, that the Hebrew text does not read “created,”
and we have ourselves read in more ancient copies “possessed” instead of “created.”
Now assuredly “possession” in the allegorical language of the Proverbs marks that slave
Who for our sakes “took upon Him the form of a slave367.” But if any one should allege in
this passage the reading which prevails in the Churches, we do not reject even the expression
“created.” For this also in allegorical language is intended to connote the “slave,” since, as
the Apostle tells us, “all creation is in bondage368.” Thus we say that this expression, as well
as the other, admits of an orthodox interpretation. For He Who for our sakes became like
as we are, was in the last days truly created,—He Who in the beginning being Word and
God afterwards became Flesh and Man. For the nature of flesh is created: and by partaking
in it in all points like as we do, yet without sin, He was created when He became man: and
He was created “after God369,” not after man, as the Apostle says, in a new manner and not
according to human wont. For we are taught that this “new man” was created—albeit of the
Holy Ghost and of the power of the Highest—whom Paul, the hierophant of unspeakable
mysteries, bids us to “put on,” using two phrases to express the garment that is to be put
on, saying in one place, “Put on the new man which after God is created370,” and in another,
“Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ371.” For thus it is that He, Who said “I am the Way372,”

perhaps §9 refers), all render the Hebrew by ἐκτήσατο (“possessed”), not by ἔκτισε (“created”). But Gregory
may be referring to mss. of the LXX. version which read ἐκτήσατο. It is clear from what follows that Mr. Gwatkin
is hardly justified in his remark (Studies of Arianism, p. 69), that “the whole discussion on Prov. viii. 22 (LXX.),
Κύριος ἔκτισέ με, κ.τ.λ., might have been avoided by a glance at the original.” The point of the controversy might
have been changed, but that would have been all. Gregory seems to feel that ἐκτήσατο requires an explanation,
though he has one ready.</note>

becomes to us who have put Him on the beginning of the ways of salvation, that He may
make us the work of His own hands, new modelling us from the evil mould of sin once more
to His own image. He is at once our foundation before the world to come, according to the
words of Paul, who says, “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid373,” and it is
true that “before the springs of the waters came forth, before the mountains were settled,
before He made the depths, and before all hills, He begetteth Me374.” For it is possible, accord
ing to the usage of the Book of Proverbs, for each of these phrases, taken in a tropical sense,
to be applied to the Word375. For the great David calls righteousness the “mountains of
God376,” His judgments “deeps377,” and the teachers in the Churches “fountains,” saying
“Bless God the Lord from the fountains of Israel378”; and guilelessness he calls “hills,” as he
shows when he speaks of their skipping like lambs379. Before these therefore is born in us
He Who for our sakes was created as man, that of these things also the creation may find
place in us. But we may, I think, pass from the discussion of these points, inasmuch as the
truth has been sufficiently pointed out in a few words to well-disposed readers; let us proceed
to what Eunomius says next.</p>
<p>“Existing in the Beginning,” he says, “not without beginning.” In what fashion does he
who plumes himself on his superior discernment understand the oracles of God? He declares
Him Who was in the beginning Himself to have a beginning: and is not aware that if He
Who is in the beginning has a beginning, then the Beginning itself must needs have another
beginning. Whatever He says of the beginning he must necessarily confess to be true of Him
Who was in the beginning: for how can that which is in the beginning be severed from the
beginning? and how can any one imagine a “was not” as preceding the “was”? For however
far one carries back one’s thought to apprehend the beginning, one most certainly understands
as one does so that the Word which was in the beginning (inasmuch as It cannot be
separated from the beginning in which It is) does not at any point of time either begin or
cease its existence therein. Yet let no one be induced by these words of mine to separate into
two the one beginning we acknowledge. For the beginning is most assuredly one, wherein
is discerned, indivisibly, that Word Who is completely united to the Father. He who thus
thinks will never leave heresy a loophole to impair his piety by the novelty of the term “ungenerate.”
But in Eunomius’ next propositions his statements are like bread with a large

admixture of sand. For by mixing his heretical opinions with sound doctrines, he makes
uneatable even that which is in itself nutritious, by the gravel which he has mingled with it.
For he calls the Lord “living wisdom,” “operative truth,” subsistent power, and “life”:—so
far is the nutritious portion. But into these assertions he instils the poison of heresy. For
when he speaks of the “life” as “generate” he makes a reservation by the implied opposition
to the “ungenerate” life, and does not affirm the Son to be the very Life. Next he says:—“As
Son of God, quickening the dead, the true light, the light that lighteneth every man coming
into the world380, good, and the bestower of good things.” All these things he offers for
honey to the simple-minded, concealing his deadly drug under the sweetness of terms like
these. For he immediately introduces, on the heels of these statements, his pernicious principle,
in the words “Not partitioning with Him that begat Him His high estate, not dividing
with another the essence of the Father, but becoming by generation glorious, yea, the Lord
of glory, and receiving glory from the Father, not sharing His glory with the Father, for the
glory of the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath said, ‘My glory will I not give to another.
381’” These are his deadly poisons, which they alone can discover who have their souls’
senses trained so to do: but the mortal mischief of the words is disclosed by their conclusion:—
Receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of
the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath said, ‘My glory will I not give to another.’ Who
is that “other” to whom God has said that He will not give His glory? The prophet speaks
of the adversary of God, and Eunomius refers the prophecy to the only begotten God
Himself! For when the prophet, speaking in the person of God, had said, “My glory will I
not give to another,” he added, “neither My praise to graven images.” For when men were
beguiled to offer to the adversary of God the worship and adoration due to God alone,
paying homage in the representations of graven images to the enemy of God, who appeared
in many shapes amongst men in the forms furnished by idols, He Who healeth them that
are sick, in pity for men’s ruin, foretold by the prophet the loving-kindness which in the
latter days He would show in the abolishing of idols, saying, “When My truth shall have
been manifested, My glory shall no more be given to another, nor My praise bestowed upon
graven images: for men, when they come to know My glory, shall no more be in bondage
to them that by nature are no gods.” All therefore that the prophet says in the person of the
Lord concerning the power of the adversary, this fighter against God, refers to the Lord
Himself, Who spake these words by the prophet! Who among the tyrants is recorded to
have been such a persecutor of the faith as this? Who maintained such blasphemy as this,
that He Who, as we believe, was manifested in the flesh for the salvation of our souls, is not

<pb n="228"/>
very God, but the adversary of God, who puts his guile into effect against men by the instrumentality
of idols and graven images? For it is what was said of that adversary by the
prophet that Eunomius transfers to the only-begotten God, without so much as reflecting
that it is the Only-begotten Himself Who spoke these words by the prophet, as Eunomius
himself subsequently confesses when he says, “this is He Who spake by the prophets.”</p>
<p>Why should I pursue this part of the subject in more detail? For the words preceding
also are tainted with the same profanity—“receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory
with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.” For my own part,
even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified in the ministration of the Law,—not
even then should I have tolerated such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having
no glory from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the favour bestowed
on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of
none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when
He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from
God only382. For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from
the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then is
the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to ask for the glory that
cometh from the only God, and if, according to our Lord’s word, “every one that asketh receiveth383?”
But one who says concerning the Brightness of the Father’s glory, that He has
the glory by having received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in Itself devoid
of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last the Lord of some glory, to receive
glory from another. How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,—one which
tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father384, and another which says, “All things
that the Father hath are Mine385”? To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says,
“He that is, as the Apostle says, the ‘heir of all things386’ that are in the Father, is without
part or lot in His Father’s glory”; or to Him Who declares that all things that the Father
hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the “all things,” glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius
says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest,
nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the
prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,—“I will pour out
of My Spirit upon all flesh387.” He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own

Spirit to all flesh,—how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten
Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps
one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the
term “impart” is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose
possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one
and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the
Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute.
This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling
in Him in His entirety—what need has He of the Father’s glory, when none of the attributes
contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?</p>

<head>§11. After expounding the high estate of the Almighty, the Eternity of the Son, and the phrase
“being made obedient,” he shows the folly of Eunomius in his assertion that the Son did
not acquire His sonship by obedience.</head>
<p>What, moreover, is the high estate of the Almighty in which Eunomius affirms that the
Son has no share? Let those, then, who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own
sight388, utter their groundling opinions—they who, as the prophet says, “speak out of the
ground389.” But let us who reverence the Word and are disciples of the Truth, or rather who
profess to be so, not leave even this assertion unsifted. We know that of all the names by
which Deity is indicated some are expressive of the Divine majesty, employed and understood
absolutely, and some are assigned with reference to the operations over us and all creation.
For when the Apostle says “Now to the immortal, invisible, only wise God390,” and the like,
by these titles he suggests conceptions which represent to us the transcendent power, but
when God is spoken of in the Scriptures as gracious, merciful, full of pity, true, good, Lord,
Physician, Shepherd, Way, Bread, Fountain, King, Creator, Artificer, Protector, Who is over
all and through all, Who is all in all, these and similar titles contain the declaration of the
operations of the Divine loving-kindness in the creation. Those then who enquire precisely
into the meaning of the term “Almighty” will find that it declares nothing else concerning
the Divine power than that operation which controls created things and is indicated by the
word “Almighty,” stands in a certain relation to something. For as He would not be called
a Physician, save on account of the sick, nor merciful and gracious, and the like, save by
reason of one who stood in need of grace and mercy, so neither would He be styled Almighty,
did not all creation stand in need of one to regulate it and keep it in being. As, then, He
presents Himself as a Physician to those who are in need of healing, so He is Almighty over
one who has need of being ruled: and just as “they that are whole have no need of a physician391,”
so it follows that we may well say that He Whose nature contains in it the principle
of unerring and unwavering rectitude does not, like others, need a ruler over Him. Accordingly,
when we hear the name “Almighty,” our conception is this, that God sustains in being
all intelligible things as well as all things of a material nature. For this cause He sitteth upon
the circle of the earth, for this cause He holdeth the ends of the earth in His hand, for this
cause He “meteth out leaven with the span, and measureth the waters in the hollow of His
hand392”; for this cause He comprehendeth in Himself all the intelligible creation, that all
things may remain in existence controlled by His encompassing power. Let us enquire, then,

Who it is that “worketh all in all.” Who is He Who made all things, and without Whom no
existing thing does exist? Who is He in Whom all things were created, and in Whom all
things that are have their continuance? In Whom do we live and move and have our being?
Who is He Who hath in Himself all that the Father hath? Does what has been said leave us
any longer in ignorance of Him Who is “God over all393,” Who is so entitled by S. Paul,—our
Lord Jesus Christ, Who, as He Himself says, holding in His hand “all things that the Father
hath394,” assuredly grasps all things in the all-containing hollow of His hand and is sovereign
over what He has grasped, and no man taketh from the hand of Him Who in His hand
holdeth all things? If, then, He hath all things, and is sovereign over that which He hath,
why is He Who is thus sovereign over all things something else and not Almighty? If heresy
replies that the Father is sovereign over both the Son and the Holy Spirit, let them first show
that the Son and the Holy Spirit are of mutable nature, and then over this mutability let
them set its ruler, that by the help implanted from above, that which is so overruled may
continue incapable of turning to evil. If, on the other hand, the Divine nature is incapable
of evil, unchangeable, unalterable, eternally permanent, to what end does it stand in need
of a ruler, controlling as it does all creation, and itself by reason of its immutability needing
no ruler to control it? For this cause it is that at the name of Christ “every knee boweth, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth395.” For assuredly every
knee would not thus bow, did it not recognize in Christ Him Who rules it for its own salvation.
But to say that the Son came into being by the goodness of the Father is nothing else
than to put Him on a level with the meanest objects of creation. For what is there that did
not arrive at its birth by the goodness of Him Who made it? To what is the formation of
mankind ascribed? to the badness of its Maker, or to His goodness? To what do we ascribe
the generation of animals, the production of plants and herbs? There is nothing that did
not take its rise from the goodness of Him Who made it. A property, then, which reason
discerns to be common to all things, Eunomius is so kind as to allow to the Eternal Son! But
that He did not share His essence or His estate with the Father—these assertions and the
rest of his verbiage I have refuted in anticipation, when dealing with his statements concerning
the Father, and shown that he has hazarded them at random and without any intelligible
meaning. For not even in the case of us who are born one of another is there any division
of essence. The definition expressive of essence remains in its entirety in each, in him that
begets and in him who is begotten, without admitting diminution in him who begets, or
augmentation in him who is begotten. But to speak of division of estate or sovereignty in
the case of Him Who hath all things whatsoever that the Father hath, carries with it no

meaning, unless it be a demonstration of the propounder’s impiety. It would therefore be
superfluous to entangle oneself in such discussions, and so to prolong our treatise to an
unreasonable length. Let us pass on to what follows.</p>
<p>“Glorified,” he says, “by the Father before the worlds.” The word of truth hath been
demonstrated, confirmed by the testimony of its adversaries. For this is the sum of our faith,
that the Son is from all eternity, being glorified by the Father: for “before the worlds” is the
same in sense as “from all eternity,” seeing that prophecy uses this phrase to set forth to us
God’s eternity, when it speaks of Him as “He that is from before the worlds396.” If then to
exist before the worlds is beyond all beginning, he who confers glory on the Son before the
worlds, does thereby assert His existence from eternity before that glory397: for surely it is
not the non-existent, but the existent which is glorified. Then he proceeds to plant for
himself the seeds of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit; not with a view to glorify the Son,
but that he may wantonly outrage the Holy Ghost. For with the intention of making out the
Holy Spirit to be part of the angelic host, he throws in the phrase “glorified eternally by the
Spirit, and by every rational and generated being,” so that there is no distinction between
the Holy Spirit and all that comes into being; if, that is, the Holy Spirit glorifies the Lord in
the same sense as all the other existences enumerated by the prophet, “angels and powers,
and the heaven of heavens, and the water above the heavens, and all the things of earth,
dragons, deeps, fire and hail, snow and vapour, wind of the storm, mountains and all hills,
fruitful trees and all cedars, beasts and all cattle, worms and feathered fowls398.” If, then, he
says, that along with these the Holy Spirit also glorifies the Lord, surely his God-opposing
tongue makes out the Holy Spirit Himself also to be one of them.</p>
<p>The disjointed incoherencies which follow next, I think it well to pass over, not because
they give no handle at all to censure, but because their language is such as might be used by
the devout, if detached from its malignant context. If he does here and there use some expressions
favourable to devotion it is just held out as a bait to simple souls, to the end that
the hook of impiety may be swallowed along with it. For after employing such language as
a member of the Church might use, he subjoins, “Obedient with regard to the creation and
production of all things that are, obedient with regard to every ministration, not having by
His obedience attained Sonship or Godhead, but, as a consequence of being Son and being
generated as the Only-begotten God, showing Himself obedient in words, obedient in acts.”
Yet who of those who are conversant with the oracles of God does not know with regard to
what point of time it was said of Him by the mighty Paul, (and that once for all), that He

“became obedient399”? For it was when He came in the form of a servant to accomplish the
mystery of redemption by the cross, Who had emptied Himself, Who humbled Himself by
assuming the likeness and fashion of a man, being found as man in man’s lowly nature—then,
I say, it was that He became obedient, even He Who “took our infirmities and bare our
sicknesses400,” healing the disobedience of men by His own obedience, that by His stripes
He might heal our wound, and by His own death do away with the common death of all
men,—then it was that for our sakes He was made obedient, even as He became “sin401”
and “a curse402” by reason of the dispensation on our behalf, not being so by nature, but
becoming so in His love for man. But by what sacred utterance was He ever taught His list
of so many obediences? Nay, on the contrary every inspired Scripture attests His independent
and sovereign power, saying, “He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and
they were created403”:—for it is plain that the Psalmist says this concerning Him Who upholds
“all things by the word of His power404,” Whose authority, by the sole impulse of His
will, framed every existence and nature, and all things in the creation apprehended by
reason or by sight. Whence, then, was Eunomius moved to ascribe in such manifold wise
to the King of the universe the attribute of obedience, speaking of Him as “obedient with
regard to all the work of creation, obedient with regard to every ministration, obedient in
words and in acts”? Yet it is plain to every one, that he alone is obedient to another in acts
and words, who has not yet perfectly achieved in himself the condition of accurate working
or unexceptionable speech, but keeping his eye ever on his teacher and guide, is trained by
his suggestions to exact propriety in deed and word. But to think that Wisdom needs a
master and teacher to guide aright Its attempts at imitation, is the dream of Eunomius’
fancy, and of his alone. And concerning the Father he says, that He is faithful in words and
faithful in works, while of the Son he does not assert faithfulness in word and deed, but only
obedience and not faithfulness, so that his profanity extends impartially through all his
statements. But it is perhaps right to pass in silence over the inconsiderate folly of the assertion
interposed between those last mentioned, lest some unreflecting persons should laugh
at its absurdity when they ought rather to weep over the perdition of their souls, than laugh
at the folly of their words. For this wise and wary theologian says that He did not attain to
being a Son as the result of His obedience! Mark his penetration! with what cogent force
does he lay it down for us that He was not first obedient and afterwards a Son, and that we

ought not to think that His obedience was prior to His generation! Now if he had not added
this defining clause, who without it would have been sufficiently silly and idiotic to fancy
that His generation was bestowed on Him by His Father, as a reward of the obedience of
Him Who before His generation had showed due subjection and obedience? But that no
one may too readily extract matter for laughter from these remarks, let each consider that
even the folly of the words has in it something worthy of tears. For what he intends to establish
by these observations is something of this kind, that His obedience is part of His nature,
so that not even if He willed it would it be possible for Him not to be obedient.</p>
<p>For he says that He was so constituted that His nature was adapted to obedience alone405,
just as among instruments that which is fashioned with regard to a certain figure necessarily
produces in that which is subjected to its operation the form which the artificer implanted
in the construction of the instrument, and cannot possibly trace a straight line upon that
which receives its mark, if its own working is in a curve; nor can the instrument, if fashioned
to draw a straight line, produce a circle by its impress. What need is there of any words of
ours to reveal how great is the profanity of such a notion, when the heretical utterance of
itself proclaims aloud its monstrosity? For if He was obedient for this reason only that He
was so made, then of course He is not on an equal footing even with humanity, since on
this theory, while our soul is self-determining and independent, choosing as it will with
sovereignty over itself that which is pleasing to it, He on the contrary exercises, or rather
experiences, obedience under the constraint of a compulsory law of His nature, while His
nature suffers Him not to disobey, even if He would. For it was “as the result of being Son,
and being begotten, that He has thus shown Himself obedient in words and obedient in
acts.” Alas, for the brutish stupidity of this doctrine! Thou makest the Word obedient to
words, and supposest other words prior to Him Who is truly the Word, and another Word
of the Beginning is mediator between the Beginning and the Word that was in the Beginning,
conveying to Him the decision. And this is not one only: there are several words, which
Eunomius makes so many links of the chain between the Beginning and the Word, and
which abuse His obedience as they think good. But what need is there to linger over this
idle talk? Any one can see that even at that time with reference to which S. Paul says that
He became obedient (and he tells us that He became obedient in this wise, namely, by becoming
for our sakes flesh, and a servant, and a curse, and sin),—even then, I say, the Lord
of glory, Who despised the shame and embraced suffering in the flesh, did not abandon His
free will, saying as He does, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up406;” and

again, “No man taketh My life from Me; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to
take it again407”; and when those who were armed with swords and staves drew near to Him
on the night before His Passion, He caused them all to go backward by saying “I am He408,”
and again, when the dying thief besought Him to remember him, He showed His universal
sovereignty by saying, “To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise409.” If then not even in
the time of His Passion He is separated from His authority, where can heresy possibly discern
the subordination to authority of the King of glory?</p>

<head>§12. He thus proceeds to a magnificent discourse of the interpretation of “Mediator,” “Like,”
“Ungenerate,” and “generate,” and of “The likeness and seal of the energy of the Almighty
and of His Works.”</head>
<p>Again, what is the manifold mediation which with wearying iteration he assigns to God,
calling Him “Mediator in doctrines, Mediator in the Law410”? It is not thus that we are
taught by the lofty utterance of the Apostle, who says that having made void the law of
commandments by His own doctrines, He is the mediator between God and man, declaring
it by this saying, “There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus411;” where by the distinction implied in the word “mediator” he reveals to us
the whole aim of the mystery of godliness. Now the aim is this. Humanity once revolted
through the malice of the enemy, and, brought into bondage to sin, was also alienated from
the true Life. After this the Lord of the creature calls back to Him His own creature, and
becomes Man while still remaining God, being both God and Man in the entirety of the two
several natures, and thus humanity was indissolubly united to God, the Man that is in Christ
conducting the work of mediation, to Whom, by the first-fruits assumed for us, all the lump
is potentially united412. Since, then, a mediator is not a mediator of one413, and God is one,
not divided among the Persons in Whom we have been taught to believe (for the Godhead
in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost is one), the Lord, therefore, becomes a mediator
once for all betwixt God and men, binding man to the Deity by Himself. But even by the
idea of a mediator we are taught the godly doctrine enshrined in the Creed. For the Mediator
between God and man entered as it were into fellowship with human nature, not by being
merely deemed a man, but having truly become so: in like manner also, being very God, He
has not, as Eunomius will have us consider, been honoured by the bare title of Godhead.</p>
<p>What he adds to the preceding statements is characterized by the same want of meaning,
or rather by the same malignity of meaning. For in calling Him “Son” Whom, a little before,
he had plainly declared to be created, and in calling Him “only begotten God” Whom he
reckoned with the rest of things that have come into being by creation, he affirms that He
is like Him that begat Him only “by an especial likeness, in a peculiar sense.” Accordingly,
we must first distinguish the significations of the term “like,” in how many senses it is employed
in ordinary use, and afterwards proceed to discuss Eunomius’ positions. In the first
place, then, all things that beguile our senses, not being really identical in nature, but producing
illusion by some of the accidents of the respective subjects, as form, colour, sound, and
the impressions conveyed by taste or smell or touch, while really different in nature, but

supposed to be other than they truly are, these custom declares to have the relation of
“likeness,” as, for example, when the lifeless material is shaped by art, whether carving,
painting, or modelling, into an imitation of a living creature, the imitation is said to be “like”
the original. For in such a case the nature of the animal is one thing, and that of the material,
which cheats the sight by mere colour and form, is another. To the same class of likeness
belongs the image of the original figure in a mirror, which gives appearances of motion,
without, however, being in nature identical with its original. In just the same way our
hearing may experience the same deception, when, for instance, some one, imitating the
song of the nightingale with his own voice, persuades our hearing so that we seem to be
listening to the bird. Taste, again, is subject to the same illusion, when the juice of figs
mimics the pleasant taste of honey: for there is a certain resemblance to the sweetness of
honey in the juice of the fruit. So, too, the sense of smell may sometimes be imposed upon
by resemblance, when the scent of the herb camomile, imitating the fragrant apple itself,
deceives our perception: and in the same way with touch also, likeness belies the truth in
various modes, since a silver or brass coin, of equal size and similar weight with a gold one,
may pass for the gold piece if our sight does not discern the truth.</p>
<p>We have thus generally described in a few words the several cases in which objects, because
they are deemed to be different from what they really are, produce delusions in our
senses. It is possible, of course, by a more laborious investigation, to extend one’s enquiry
through all things which are really different in kind one from another, but are nevertheless
thought, by virtue of some accidental resemblance, to be like one to the other. Can it possibly
be such a form of “likeness” as this, that he is continually attributing to the Son? Nay, surely
he cannot be so infatuated as to discover deceptive similarity in Him Who is the Truth.
Again, in the inspired Scriptures, we are told of another kind of resemblance by Him Who
said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness414;” but I do not suppose that Eunomius
would discern this kind of likeness between the Father and the Son, so as to make
out the Only-begotten God to be identical with man. We are also aware of another kind of
likeness, of which the word speaks in Genesis concerning Seth,—“Adam begat a son in his
own likeness, after his image415”; and if this is the kind of likeness of which Eunomius
speaks, we do not think his statement is to be rejected. For in this case the nature of the two
objects which are alike is not different, and the impress and type imply community of nature.
These, or such as these, are our views upon the variety of meanings of “like.” Let us see,
then, with what intention Eunomius asserts of the Son that “especial likeness” to the Father,
when he says that He is “like the Father with an especial likeness, in a peculiar sense, not as
Father to Father, for they are not two Fathers.” He promises to show us the “especial likeness”
<note type="footnote">414 Gen. i. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">415 Gen. v. 3.</note>

<pb n="238"/>
of the Son to the Father, and proceeds by his definition to establish the position that we
ought not to conceive of Him as being like. For by saying, “He is not like as Father to Father,”
he makes out that He is not like; and again when he adds, “nor as Ungenerate to Ungenerate,”
by this phrase, too, he forbids us to conceive a likeness in the Son to the Father; and finally,
by subjoining “nor as Son to Son,” he introduces a third conception, by which he entirely
subverts the meaning of “like.” So it is that he follows up his own statements, and conducts
his demonstration of likeness by establishing unlikeness. And now let us examine the discernment
and frankness which he displays in these distinctions. After saying that the Son
is like the Father, he guards the statement by adding that we ought not to think that the Son
is like the Father, “as Father to Father.” Why, what man on earth is such a fool as, on
learning that the Son is like the Father, to be brought by any course of reasoning to think
of the likeness of Father to Father? “Nor as Son to Son”:—here, again, the acuteness of the
distinction is equally conspicuous. When he tells us that the Son is like the Father, he adds
the further definition that He must not be understood to be like Him in the same way as
He would be like another Son. These are the mysteries of the awful doctrines of Eunomius,
by which his disciples are made wiser than the rest of the world, by learning that the Son,
by His likeness to the Father, is not like a Son, for the Son is not the Father: nor is He like
“as Ungenerate to Ungenerate,” for the Son is not ungenerate. But the mystery which we
have received, when it speaks of the Father, certainly bids us understand the Father of the
Son, and when it names the Son, teaches us to apprehend the Son of the Father. And until
the present time we never felt the need of these philosophic refinements, that by the words
Father and Son are suggested two Fathers or two Sons, a pair, so to say, of ungenerate beings.</p>
<p>Now the drift of Eunomius’ excessive concern about the Ungenerate has been often
explained before; and it shall here be briefly discovered yet again. For as the term Father
points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement
to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names
Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing
the terms “generate” and “ungenerate,” since the contradictory opposition between them
admits of no mean, just like that between “mortal” and “immortal,” “rational” and “irrational,”
and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature
of their meaning,—by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity,
so as to contemplate as existing in the “generate” with reference to the “ungenerate” the
same difference which there is between “mortal” and “immortal”: and even as the nature of
the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational
and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that
the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that
as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by
a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he

<pb n="239"/>
attaches to the ungenerate the name of “Almighty,” and this he does not apply to express
providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the
application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the
subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary
and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he
employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before
us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either
as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,—and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably
be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and
another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian’s son black, but
the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each
is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian’s account, nor does the Ethiopian’s
body change to white on account of the Scythian,—after saying this, however, according to
his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that “He is like as Son to Father416.” But although such
a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and
Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition
of the title “Son,” defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy417 of the
Almighty. “For the Son,” he says, “is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.” Let
him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point—What is “the seal of
the energy”? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on
the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, for example, the energy
of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer
any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;—when the exertion of him
who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence,
either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases
from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither
essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal,
and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his
juggling with idle opinions comes to,—belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity
surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists,
who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise
their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder?
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God418.”
And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple,

who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? “Being,” he says, “the
Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person419.” What, after these have
thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist420? “The seal,” quoth he, “of the energy of
the Almighty.” He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating
between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was
in the beginning, is “the seal of the energy”:—the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated
in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father421,
Who sustains all things, by the word of His power422, the creator of the ages, from Whom
and through Whom and in Whom are all things423, Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his
hand424, Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh
upon the things that are lowly425, or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be
His footstool426, imprinted by the footmark of the Word—the form of God427 is “the seal”
of an “energy.” Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very
truth says He is “the express image,” not of His energy, but “of His Person.” Is the Brightness
of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate
between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator
with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and
its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the
greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the
proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy
hold concerning Him? What says he? “As image,” he says, “and seal of all the energy and
power of the Almighty.” How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty
Paul? Paul says that the Son is “the Power of God428”; Eunomius calls Him “the seal of a
power,” not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his
previous statement? He calls Him “seal of the Father’s works and words and counsels.” To
what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are

therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten.
To what works of the Father, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal?
what Scripture ever entitled Him “seal of the Father’s works”? But if any one should grant
Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture
does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says
that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All
things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole
world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of
the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things
visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the “seal”? Will he perhaps,
when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the
Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be the seal of these works when
He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person
is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak
of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to
understand likeness by the term “seal.” But what other “words” of the Father does Eunomius
know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a “seal”—Him Who
is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels
can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made
like, in becoming a “seal” of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection,
at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule,
without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about. For He Who has
the Father in His entirety in Himself, and is Himself in His entirety in the Father, as Word
and Wisdom and Power and Truth, as His express image and brightness, Himself is all
things in the Father, and does not come to be the image and seal and likeness of certain
other things discerned in the Father prior to Himself.</p>
<p>Then Eunomius allows to Him the credit of the destruction of men by water in the days
of Noah, of the rain of fire that fell upon Sodom, and of the just vengeance upon the Egyptians,
as though he were making some great concessions to Him Who holds in His hand
the ends of the world, in Whom, as the Apostle says, “all things consist429,” as though he
were not aware that to Him Who encompasses all things, and guides and sways according
to His good pleasure all that hath already been and all that will be, the mention of two or
three marvels does not mean the addition of glory, so much as the suppression of the rest
means its deprivation or loss. But even if no word be said of these, the one utterance of Paul
is enough by itself to point to them all inclusively—the one utterance which says that He
“is above all, and through all, and in all430.”</p>

<head>§13. He expounds the passage of the Gospel, “The Father judgeth no man,” and further speaks
of the assumption of man with body and soul wrought by the Lord, of the transgression
of Adam, and of death and the resurrection of the dead.</head>
<p>Next he says, “He legislates by the command of the Eternal God.” Who is the eternal
God? and who is He that ministers to Him in the giving of the Law? Thus much is plain to
all, that through Moses God appointed the Law to those that received it. Now inasmuch as
Eunomius himself acknowledges that it was the only-begotten God Who held converse with
Moses, how is it that the assertion before us puts the Lord of all in the place of Moses, and
ascribes the character of the eternal God to the Father alone, so as, by thus contrasting Him
with the Eternal, to make out the only-begotten God, the Maker of the Worlds, to be not
Eternal? Our studious friend with his excellent memory seems to have forgotten that Paul
uses all these terms concerning himself, announcing among men the proclamation of the
Gospel by the command of God431. Thus what the Apostle asserts of himself, that Eunomius
is not ashamed to ascribe to the Lord of the prophets and apostles, in order to place the
Master on the same level with Paul, His own servant. But why should I lengthen out my
argument by confuting in detail each of these assertions, where the too unsuspicious reader
of Eunomius’ writings may think that their author is saying what Holy Scripture allows him
to say, while one who is able to unravel each statement critically will find them one and all
infected with heretical knavery. For the Churchman and the heretic alike affirm that “the
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son432,” but to this assertion
they severally attach different meanings. By the same words the Churchman understands
supreme authority, the other maintains subservience and subjection.</p>
<p>But to what has been already said, ought to be added some notice of that position which
they make a kind of foundation of their impiety in their discussions concerning the Incarnation,
the position, namely, that not the whole man has been saved by Him, but only the
half of man, I mean the body. Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine,
is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in His humanity, are to
be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy
to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this
reason it is that Eunomius says, “He who in the last days became man did not take upon
Himself the man made up of soul and body.” But, after searching through all the inspired
and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things,
at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without
a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of
salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to
<note type="footnote">431 Cf. Rom. xvi. 26</note>
<note type="footnote">432 S. John v. 22</note>

<pb n="243"/>
confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The
Lord came “to seek and to save that which was lost433.” Now it was not the body merely,
but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak
more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the
body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster
of our nature had its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies
in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without
respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death
correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that
operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction
of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its
kindred elements: but “the soul that sinneth,” he saith, “it shall die434.” Now sin is nothing
else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived
many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, “In the day
that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die435.” For by the fact of his alienation from the true life,
the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much
later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this
cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the
parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders
the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to
the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the
soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised:
and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy
along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction
of the enemies of the Lord, said, “They are dead which sought the young Child’s life436,”
(or “soul”): and the Lord says to the Jews, “Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the
truth437.” Now by “Man” is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed
of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, “Are ye angry at Me, because I have
made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day438?” And what He meant by “every whit
whole,” He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a

couch in the midst, “Thy sins be forgiven thee,” which is a healing of the soul, and, “Arise
and walk439,” which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the
soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, “Thou
art made whole, sin no more440,” thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul
and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, “for to make in Himself of twain one new man441.”
And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul
from His body, saying, “No man taketh” my soul “from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I
have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again442.” Yea, the prophet David
also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, “Thou
wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption443,”
while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that “His soul was not left in hell, neither
His flesh did see corruption.” For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh
and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and
so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the
dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without
being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and
by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature
a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that
all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our
first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter
said, “This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ444;” and
we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord,
reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence
to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them
through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into
every detail.</p>
<p>Before passing on, however, to what follows, I will further mention the one text, “Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up445.” Just as we, through soul and body, become
a temple of Him Who “dwelleth in us and walketh in us446,” even so the Lord terms their

combination a “temple,” of which the “destruction” signifies the dissolution of the soul from
the body. And if they allege the passage in the Gospel, “The Word was made flesh447,” in
order to make out that the flesh was taken into the Godhead without the soul, on the ground
that the soul is not expressly mentioned along with the flesh, let them learn that it is customary
for Holy Scripture to imply the whole by the part. For He that said, “Unto Thee shall all
flesh come448,” does not mean that the flesh will be presented before the Judge apart from
the souls: and when we read in sacred History that Jacob went down into Egypt with seventyfive
souls449 we understand the flesh also to be intended together with the souls. So, then,
the Word, when He became flesh, took with the flesh the whole of human nature; and hence
it was possible that hunger and thirst, fear and dread, desire and sleep, tears and trouble of
spirit, and all such things, were in Him. For the Godhead, in its proper nature, admits no
such affections, nor is the flesh by itself involved in them, if the soul is not affected co-ordinately
with the body.</p>

<head>§14. He proceeds to discuss the views held by Eunomius, and by the Church, touching the Holy
Spirit; and to show that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are not three Gods, but
one God. He also discusses different senses of “Subjection,” and therein shows that the
subjection of all things to the Son is the same as the subjection of the Son to the Father.</head>
<p>Thus much with regard to his profanity towards the Son. Now let us see what he says
about the Holy Spirit. “After Him, we believe,” he says, “on the Comforter, the Spirit of
Truth.” I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view
in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements
concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will
nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former
case, he avoided using the name “Father,” that so he might not include the Son in the
eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest
His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying “Holy Spirit,” that he
may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with
the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of “Spirit,” and that of “Holy,” are by the
Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for “God is a Spirit450,” and “the
anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face451,” and “the Lord our God is Holy452,” and there
is “one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ453”) lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred
in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would
naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the
Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as
set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence,
for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, “We believe in the
Holy Spirit,” and “God is a Spirit,” any one instructed in things divine would have interposed
the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly
not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For
of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and
absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature
also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is
that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, “We
believe in the Comforter.” But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the
inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of

<pb n="247"/>
“Comforter” equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit454; and the Father, where He is said
to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of “Comforter.” For assuredly he Who
does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David
says to the Father, “Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me455,” and the great Apostle
applies to the Father the same language, when he says, “Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation456”; and John, in one of his
Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter457. Nay, more, the Lord
Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit,
clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the word
παρακαλεῖν458,—one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom
we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,—the
other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,—the Holy
Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine
nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word παρακαλεῖν the healing power of
God, as when he says, “God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the
coming of Titus459”; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he
says, writing to the Corinthians, “Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God460.” Now since
these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title “Paraclete,” when used of the
Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with
the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle
the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers
also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him “the Spirit of Truth,” Eunomius’ own
wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he
called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the
Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness461; and we certainly
do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when
we hear of the “Spirit of Truth,” we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the

Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the
Lord said “The Spirit of Truth,” He immediately added “Which proceedeth from the Father462,”
a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation,
not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of
any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain
then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar
to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in “the Guide of godliness.” Let a man then
believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by
whom we have been led into the way of the faith. For if we are to believe in “that which
guides us to godliness,” along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers
and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors, and teachers, have equal honour with
the Holy Spirit, as they have been “guides to godliness” to those who came after them. “Who
came into being,” he goes on, “by the only God through the Only-begotten.” In these words
he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father “only God,” who
employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow
of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction
from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this? Which of the
Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely
inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example
(for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power
to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that
utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of
God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying,
that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But
as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God463. So also when the Lord
by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, “Of His
fulness have all we received464.” And that “in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead465,”
the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the
manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat “on
the throne high and lifted up466;” the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father
Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying,

the Lord, “These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him467.” But the
mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews
at Rome, when he says, “Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you,
saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand468,” showing, in my opinion, by Holy
Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in
the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Hence when David says, “they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the
desert469,” the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in
these terms: “Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me470,” and
goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those
who keep repeating against us the phrase “three Gods,” because we hold these views, have
perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality,
(for they are, according to the Lord’s words, One, and not Two471) and if the Holy
Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is
it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods,
without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added
to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of
tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name
of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>Let us however resume Eunomius’ statement in its entirety. “Having come into being
from the only God through the Only-begotten, this Spirit also—” What proof is there of the
statement that “this Spirit also” is one of the things that were made by the Only-begotten?
They will say of course that “all things were made by Him472,” and that in the term “all
things” “this Spirit also” is included. Our answer to them shall be this, All things were made
by Him, that were made. Now the things that were made, as Paul tells us, were things visible
and invisible, thrones, authorities, dominions, principalities, powers, and among those included
under the head of thrones and powers are reckoned by Paul the Cherubim and Seraphim473:
so far does the term “all things” extend. But of the Holy Spirit, as being above the
nature of things that have come into being, Paul said not a word in his enumeration of ex-

isting things, not indicating to us by his words either His subordination or His coming into
being; but just as the prophet calls the Holy Spirit “good,” and “right,” and “guiding474”
(indicating by the word “guiding” the power of control), even so the apostle ascribes independent
authority to the dignity of the Spirit, when he affirms that He works all in all as He
wills475. Again, the Lord makes manifest the Spirit’s independent power and operation in
His discourse with Nicodemus, when He says, “The Spirit breatheth where He willeth476.”
How is it then that Eunomius goes so far as to define that He also is one of the things that
came into being by the Son, condemned to eternal subjection. For he describes Him as “once
for all made subject,” enthralling the guiding and governing Spirit in I know not what form
of subjection. For this expression of “subjection” has many significations in Holy Scripture,
and is understood and used with many varieties of meaning. For the Psalmist says that even
irrational nature is put in subjection477, and brings under the same term those who are
overcome in war478, while the apostle bids servants to be in subjection to their own masters479,
and that those who are placed over the priesthood should have their children in
subjection480, as their disorderly conduct brings discredit upon their fathers, as in the case
of the sons of Eli the priest. Again, he speaks of the subjection of all men to God, when we
all, being united to one another by the faith, become one body of the Lord Who is in all, as
the subjection of the Son to the Father, when the adoration paid to the Son by all things
with one accord, by things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, redounds
to the glory of the Father; as Paul says elsewhere, “To Him every knee shall bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father481.” For when this takes
place, the mighty wisdom of Paul affirms that the Son, Who is in all, is subject to the Father
by virtue of the subjection of those in whom He is. What kind of “subjection once for all”
Eunomius asserts of the Holy Spirit, it is thus impossible to learn from the phrase which he
has thrown out,—whether he means the subjection of irrational creatures, or of captives,
or of servants, or of children who are kept in order, or of those who are saved by subjection.

For the subjection of men to God is salvation for those who are so made subject, according
to the voice of the prophet, who says that his soul is subject to God, since of Him cometh
salvation by subjection482, so that subjection is the means of averting perdition. As therefore
the help of the healing art is sought eagerly by the sick, so is subjection by those who are in
need of salvation. But of what life does the Holy Spirit, that quickeneth all things, stand in
need, that by subjection He should obtain salvation for Himself? Since then it is not on the
strength of any Divine utterance that he asserts such an attribute of the Spirit, nor yet is it
as a consequence of probable arguments that he has launched this blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit, it must be plain at all events to sensible men that he vents his impiety against
Him without any warrant whatsoever, unsupported as it is by any authority from Scripture
or by any logical consequence.</p>

<head>§15. Lastly he displays at length the folly of Eunomius, who at times speaks of the Holy Spirit
as created, and as the fairest work of the Son, and at other times confesses, by the operations
attributed to Him, that He is God, and thus ends the book.</head>
<p>He goes on to add, “Neither on the same level with the Father, nor connumerated with
the Father (for God over all is one and only Father), nor on an equality with the Son, for
the Son is only-begotten, having none begotten with Him.” Well, for my own part, if he had
only added to his previous statement the remark that the Holy Ghost is not the Father of
the Son, I should even then have thought it idle for him to linger over what no one ever
doubted, and forbid people to form notions of Him which not even the most witless would
entertain. But since he endeavours to establish his impiety by irrelevant and unconnected
statements, imagining that by denying the Holy Spirit to be the Father of the Only-begotten
he makes out that He is subject and subordinate, I therefore made mention of these words,
as a proof of the folly of the man who imagines that he is demonstrating the Spirit to be
subject to the Father on the ground that the Spirit is not Father of the Only-begotten. For
what compels the conclusion, that if He be not Father, He must be subject? If it had been
demonstrated that “Father” and “despot” were terms identical in meaning, it would no
doubt have followed that, as absolute sovereignty was part of the conception of the Father,
we should affirm that the Spirit is subject to Him Who surpassed Him in respect of authority.
But if by “Father” is implied merely His relation to the Son, and no conception of absolute
sovereignty or authority is involved by the use of the word, how does it follow, from the fact
that the Spirit is not the Father of the Son, that the Spirit is subject to the Father? “Nor on
an equality with the Son,” he says. How comes he to say this? for to be, and to be unchangeable,
and to admit no evil whatsoever, and to remain unalterably in that which is good, all
this shows no variation in the case of the Son and of the Spirit. For the incorruptible nature
of the Spirit is remote from corruption equally with that of the Son, and in the Spirit, just
as in the Son, His essential goodness is absolutely apart from its contrary, and in both alike
their perfection in every good stands in need of no addition.</p>
<p>Now the inspired Scripture teaches us to affirm all these attributes of the Spirit, when
it predicates of the Spirit the terms “good,” and “wise,” and “incorruptible,” and “immortal,”
and all such lofty conceptions and names as are properly applied to Godhead. If then He is
inferior in none of these respects, by what means does Eunomius determine the inequality
of the Son and the Spirit? “For the Son is,” he tells us, “Only-begotten, having no brother
begotten with Him.” Well, the point, that we are not to understand the “Only-begotten” to
have brethren, we have already discussed in our comments upon the phrase “first-born of
all creation483.” But we ought not to leave unexamined the sense that Eunomius now unfairly
attaches to the term. For while the doctrine of the Church declares that in the Father, the
<note type="footnote">483 See above, §8 of this book.</note>

<pb n="253"/>
Son, and the Holy Ghost there is one power, and goodness, and essence, and glory, and the
like, saving the difference of the Persons, this man, when he wishes to make the essence of
the Only-begotten common to the creation, calls Him “the first-born of all creation” in respect
of His pre-temporal existence, declaring by this mode of expression that all conceivable
objects in creation are in brotherhood with the Lord; for assuredly the first-born is not the
first-born of those otherwise begotten, but of those begotten like Himself484. But when he
is bent upon severing the Spirit from union with the Son, he calls Him “Only-begotten, not
having any brother begotten with Him,” not with the object of conceiving of Him as without
brethren, but that by the means of this assertion he may establish touching the Spirit His
essential alienation from the Son. It is true that we learn from Holy Scripture not to speak
of the Holy Ghost as brother of the Son: but that we are not to say that the Holy Ghost is
homogeneous485 with the Son, is nowhere shown in the divine Scriptures. For if there does
reside in the Father and the Son a life-giving power, it is ascribed also to the Holy Spirit,
according to the words of the Gospel. If one may discern alike in Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit the properties of being incorruptible, immutable, of admitting no evil, of being good,
right, guiding, of working all in all as He wills, and all the like attributes, how is it possible
by identity in these respects to infer difference in kind? Accordingly the word of godliness
agrees in affirming that we ought not to regard any kind of brotherhood as attaching to the
Only-begotten; but to say that the Spirit is not homogeneous with the Son, the upright with
the upright, the good with the good, the life-giving with the life-giving, this has been clearly
demonstrated by logical inference to be a piece of heretical knavery.</p>
<p>Why then is the majesty of the Spirit curtailed by such arguments as these? For there is
nothing which can be the cause of producing in him deviation by excess or defect from
conceptions such as befit the Godhead, nor, since all these are by Holy Scripture predicated
equally of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, can he inform us wherein he discerns inequality
to exist. But he launches his blasphemy against the Holy Ghost in its naked form, ill-prepared
and unsupported by any consecutive argument. “Nor yet ranked,” he says, “with any other:
for He has gone above486 all the creatures that came into being by the instrumentality of
the Son in mode of being, and nature, and glory, and knowledge, as the first and noblest
work of the Only-begotten, the greatest and most glorious.” I will leave, however, to others
the task of ridiculing the bad taste and surplusage of his style, thinking as I do that it is unseemly
for the gray hairs of age, when dealing with the argument before us, to make vulgarity
<note type="footnote">484 Or, “not the first-born of beings of a different race, but of those of his own stock.”</note>

<pb n="254"/>
of expression an objection against one who is guilty of impiety. I will just add to my investigation
this remark. If the Spirit has “gone above” all the creations of the Son, (for I will use
his own ungrammatical and senseless phrase, or rather, to make things clearer, I will present
his idea in my own language) if he transcends all things wrought by the Son, the Holy Spirit
cannot be ranked with the rest of the creation; and if, as Eunomius says, he surpasses them
by virtue of priority of birth, he must needs confess, in the case of the rest of creation, that
the objects which are first in order of production are more to be esteemed than those which
come after them. Now the creation of the irrational animals was prior to that of man. Accordingly
he will of course declare that the irrational nature is more honourable than rational
existence. So too, according to the argument of Eunomius, Cain will be proved superior to
Abel, in that he was before him in time of birth, and so the stars will be shown to be lower
and of less excellence than all the things that grow out of the earth; for these last sprang
from the earth on the third day, and all the stars are recorded by Moses to have been created
on the fourth. Well, surely no one is such a simpleton as to infer that the grass of the earth
is more to be esteemed than the marvels of the sky, on the ground of its precedence in time,
or to award the meed to Cain over Abel, or to place below the irrational animals man who
came into being later than they. So there is no sense in our author’s contention that the
nature of the Holy Spirit is superior to that of the creatures that came into being subsequently,
on the ground that He came into being before they did. And now let us see what he who
separates Him from fellowship with the Son is prepared to concede to the glory of the
Spirit: “For he too,” he says, “being one, and first and alone, and surpassing all the creations
of the Son in essence and dignity of nature, accomplishing every operation and all teaching
according to the good pleasure of the Son, being sent by Him, and receiving from Him, and
declaring to those who are instructed, and guiding into truth.” He speaks of the Holy Ghost
as “accomplishing every operation and all teaching.” What operation? Does he mean that
which the Father and the Son execute, according to the word of the Lord Himself Who
“hitherto worketh487” man’s salvation, or does he mean some other? For if His work is that
named, He has assuredly the same power and nature as Him Who works it, and in such an
one difference of kind from Deity can have no place. For just as, if anything should perform
the functions of fire, shining and warming in precisely the same way, it is itself certainly
fire, so if the Spirit does the works of the Father, He must assuredly be acknowledged to be
of the same nature with Him. If on the other hand He operates something else than our
salvation, and displays His operation in a contrary direction, He will thereby be proved to
be of a different nature and essence. But Eunomius’ statement itself bears witness that the
Spirit quickeneth in like manner with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, from the identity
of operations it results assuredly that the Spirit is not alien from the nature of the Father
<note type="footnote">487 S. John v. 17</note>

<pb n="255"/>
and the Son. And to the statement that the Spirit accomplishes the operation and teaching
of the Father according to the good pleasure of the Son we assent. For the community of
nature gives us warrant that the will of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is one,
and thus, if the Holy Spirit wills that which seems good to the Son, the community of will
clearly points to unity of essence. But he goes on, “being sent by Him, and receiving from
Him, and declaring to those who are instructed, and guiding into truth.” If he had not previously
said what he has concerning the Spirit, the reader would surely have supposed that
these words applied to some human teacher. For to receive a mission is the same thing as
to be sent, and to have nothing of one’s own, but to receive of the free favour of him who
gives the mission, and to minister his words to those who are under instruction, and to be
a guide into truth for those that are astray. All these things, which Eunomius is good enough
to allow to the Holy Spirit, belong to the present pastors and teachers of the Church,—to
be sent, to receive, to announce, to teach, to suggest the truth. Now, as he had said above
“He is one, and first, and alone, and surpassing all,” had he but stopped there, he would
have appeared as a defender of the doctrines of truth. For He Who is indivisibly contemplated
in the One is most truly One, and first Who is in the First, and alone Who is in the Only
One. For as the spirit of man that is in him, and the man himself, are but one man, so also
the Spirit of God which is in Him, and God Himself, would properly be termed One God,
and First and Only, being incapable of separation from Him in Whom He is. But as things
are, with his addition of his profane phrase, “surpassing all the creatures of the Son,” he
produces turbid confusion by assigning to Him Who “breatheth where He willeth488,” and
“worketh all in all489,” a mere superiority in comparison with the rest of created things.</p>
<p>Let us now see further what he adds to this “sanctifying the saints.” If any one says this
also of the Father and of the Son, he will speak truly. For those in whom the Holy One dwells,
He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. “Acting as a guide to those who approach
the mystery.” This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the
Apostle plants by his guidance490, and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental
regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places
on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. “Distributing every
gift.” With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy
Spirit. “Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things
appointed.” As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful,

<pb n="256"/>
whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement
so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or
the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated
in the lists of saving gifts, “all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as He will491,” we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius
when he says that the Spirit “co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation
of things appointed” by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for
us. “Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.” It would be foolish seriously to examine
the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once
manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that
the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to
ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? “Leading us to that which is expedient
for us.” This the Father and the Son likewise do: for “He leadeth Joseph like a sheep492,”
and, “led His people like sheep493,” and, “the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness494.”
“Strengthening us to godliness.” To strengthen man to godliness David says is the
work of God; “For Thou art my strength and my refuge495,” says the Psalmist, and “the Lord
is the strength of His people496,” and, “He shall give strength and power unto His people497.”
If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist,
they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word
of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he
sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, “Lightening souls
with the light of knowledge.” This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the
Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David498, and from
thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the
cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord.
For it was “the brightness of the Father’s glory, and the express image of His person,” Who
“purged our sins499.” Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the
Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, “I charge thee500,” ascribes

to the power of the Spirit, when He says, “If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils501,” so that
the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration
of His divine and transcendent power. “Healing the sick,” he says, “curing the infirm,
comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.” These
are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe
the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms
that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power
of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even
of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, “Have mercy
upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed502!” It is to God
that Isaiah says, “The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them503.” Again, prophetic
language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For “they went
astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,” says the Psalmist, and he adds, “So He led them
forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt504:” and, “when the
Lord turned again the captivity of Sion505.” In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted
is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, “Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation506.” Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in
the person of God, “Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee507.” And the
setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the
power of the Lord: “Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my
help508,” and “Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with
His hand509,” and “The Lord helpeth them that are fallen510.” And to the loving-kindness
of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same
thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, “Thou laidest trouble upon our
loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and
Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place511.”</p>

<p>Thus far then the majesty of the Spirit is demonstrated by the evidence of our opponents,
but in what follows the limpid waters of devotion are once more defiled by the mud of
heresy. For he says of the Spirit that He “cheers on those who are contending”: and this
phrase involves him in the charge of extreme folly and impiety. For in the stadium some
have the task of arranging the competitions between those who intend to show their athletic
vigour; others, who surpass the rest in strength and skill, strive for the victory and strip to
contend with one another, while the rest, taking sides in their good wishes with one or
other of the competitors, according as they are severally disposed towards or interested in
one athlete or another, cheer him on at the time of the engagement, and bid him guard
against some hurt, or remember some trick of wrestling, or keep himself unthrown by the
help of his art. Take note from what has been said to how low a rank Eunomius degrades
the Holy Spirit. For while on the course there are some who arrange the contests, and others
who settle whether the contest is conducted according to rule, others who are actually engaged,
and yet others who cheer on the competitors, who are acknowledged to be far inferior
to the athletes themselves, Eunomius considers the Holy Spirit as one of the mob who look
on, or as one of those who attend upon the athletes, seeing that He neither determines the
contest nor awards the victory, nor contends with the adversary, but merely cheers without
contributing at all to the victory. For He neither joins in the fray, nor does He implant the
power to contend, but merely wishes that the athlete in whom He is interested may not
come off second in the strife. And so Paul wrestles “against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places512,”
while the Spirit of power does not strengthen the combatants nor distribute to them His
gifts, “dividing to every man severally as He will513,” but His influence is limited to cheering
on those who are engaged.</p>
<p>Again he says, “Emboldening the faint-hearted.” And here, while in accordance with
his own method he follows his previous blasphemy against the Spirit, the truth for all that
manifests itself, even through unfriendly lips. For to none other than to God does it belong
to implant courage in the fearful, saying to the faint-hearted, “Fear not, for I am with thee,
be not dismayed514,” as says the Psalmist, “Yea though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me515.” Nay, the Lord Himself says to
the fearful,—“Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid516,” and, “Why are ye

fearful, O ye of little faith517?” and, “Be of good cheer, it is I, be not afraid518,” and again,
“Be of good cheer: I have overcome the world519.” Accordingly, even though this may not
have been the intention of Eunomius, orthodoxy asserts itself by means even of the voice
of an enemy. And the next sentence agrees with that which went before:—“Caring for all,
and showing all concern and forethought.” For in fact it belongs to God alone to care and
to take thought for all, as the mighty David has expressed it, “I am poor and needy, but the
Lord careth for me520.” And if what remains seems to be resolved into empty words, with
sound and without sense, let no one find fault, seeing that in most of what he says, so far as
any sane meaning is concerned, he is feeble and untutored. For what on earth he means
when he says, “for the onward leading of the better disposed and the guardianship of the
more faithful,” neither he himself, nor they who senselessly admire his follies, could possibly
tell us.</p>

<head>§1. This third book shows a third fall of Eunomius, as refuting himself, and sometimes saying
that the Son is to be called Only-begotten in virtue of natural generation, and that Holy
Scripture proves this from the first; at other times, that by reason of His being created He
should not be called a Son, but a “product,” or “creature.”</head>
<p>If, when a man “strives lawfully521,” he finds a limit to his struggle in the contest by his
adversary’s either refusing the struggle, and withdrawing of his own accord in favour of his
conqueror from his effort for victory, or being thrown according to the rules of wrestling
in three falls (whereby the glory of the crown is bestowed with all the splendour of proclamation
upon him who has proved victorious in the umpire’s judgment), then, since Eunomius,
though he has been already twice thrown in our previous arguments, does not consent that
truth should hold the tokens of her victory over falsehood, but yet a third time raises the
dust against godly doctrine in his accustomed arena of falsehood with his composition,
strengthening himself for his struggle on the side of deceit, our statement of truth must also
be now called forth to put his falsehood to rout, placing its hopes in Him Who is the Giver
and the Judge of victory, and at the same time deriving strength from the very unfairness
of the adversaries’ tricks of wrestling. For we are not ashamed to confess that we have prepared
for our contest no weapon of argument sharpened by rhetoric, that we can bring
forward to aid us in the fight with those arrayed against us, no cleverness or sharpness of
dialectic, such as with inexperienced judges lays even on truth the suspicion of falsehood.
One strength our reasoning against falsehood has—first the very Word Himself, Who is the
might of our word,522 and in the next place the rottenness of the arguments set against us,
which is overthrown and falls by its own spontaneous action. Now in order that it may be
made as clear as possible to all men, that the very efforts of Eunomius serve as means for
his own overthrow to those who contend with him, I will set forth to my readers his phantom
doctrine (for so I think that doctrine may be called which is quite outside the truth), and I
would have you all, who are present at our struggle, and watch the encounter now taking
place between my doctrine and that which is matched with it, to be just judges of the lawful
striving of our arguments, that by your just award the reasoning of godliness may be proclaimed
as victor to the whole theatre of the Church, having won undisputed victory over
ungodliness, and being decorated, in virtue of the three falls of its enemy, with the unfading
crown of them that are saved. Now this statement is set forth against the truth by way of
preface to his third discourse, and this is the fashion of it:—“Preserving,” he says, “natural
order, and abiding by those things which are known to us from above, we do not refuse to

<pb n="261"/>
speak of the Son, seeing He is begotten, even by the name of ‘product of generation523,’
since the generated essence and524 the appellation of Son make such a relation of words
appropriate.” I beg the reader to give his attention carefully to this point, that while he calls
God both “begotten” and “Son,” he refers the reason of such names to “natural order,” and
calls to witness to this conception the knowledge possessed from above: so that if anything
should be found in the course of what follows contrary to the positions he has laid down,
it is clear to all that he is overthrown by himself, refuted by his own arguments before ours
are brought against him. And so let us consider his statement in the light of his own words.
He confesses that the name of “Son” would by no means be properly applied to the Onlybegotten
God, did not “natural order,” as he says, confirm the appellation. If, then, one were
to withdraw the order of nature from the consideration of the designation of “Son,” his use
of this name, being deprived of its proper and natural significance, will be meaningless. And
moreover the fact that he says these statements are confirmed, in that they abide by the
knowledge possessed from above, is a strong additional support to the orthodox view
touching the designation of “Son,” seeing that the inspired teaching of the Scriptures, which
comes to us from above, confirms our argument on these matters. If these things are so,
and this is a standard of truth that admits of no deception, that these two concur—the
“natural order,” as he says, and the testimony of the knowledge given from above confirming
the natural interpretation—it is clear, that to assert anything contrary to these, is nothing
else than manifestly to fight against the truth itself. Let us hear again what this writer, who
makes nature his instructor in the matter of this name, and says that he abides by the
knowledge given to us from above by the instruction of the saints, sets out at length a little
further on, after the passage I have just quoted. For I will pretermit for the time the continuous
recital of what is set next in order in his treatise, that the contradiction in what he has
written may not escape detection, being veiled by the reading of the intervening matter.
“The same argument,” he says, “will apply also in the case of what is made and created, as
both the natural interpretation and the mutual relation of the things, and also the use of the
saints, give us free authority for the use of the formula: wherefore one would not be wrong
in treating the thing made as corresponding to the maker, and the thing created to the creator.”
Of what product of making or of creation does he speak, as having naturally the relation
expressed in its name towards its maker and creator? If of those we contemplate in the creation,
visible and invisible (as Paul recounts, when he says that by Him all things were created,
visible and invisible)525, so that this relative conjunction of names has a proper and special

<pb n="262"/>
application, that which is made being set in relation to the maker, that which is created to
the creator,—if this is his meaning, we agree with him. For in fact, since the Lord is the
Maker of angels, the angel is assuredly a thing made by Him that made him: and since the
Lord is the Creator of the world, clearly the world itself and all that is therein are called the
creature of Him that created them. If however it is with this intention that he makes his interpretation
of “natural order,” systematizing the appropriation of relative terms with a view
to their mutual relation in verbal sense, even thus it would be an extraordinary thing, seeing
that every one is aware of this, that he should leave his doctrinal statement to draw out for
us a system of grammatical trivialities526. But if it is to the Only-begotten God that he applies
such phrases, so as to say that He is a thing made by Him that made Him, a creature of Him
that created Him, and to refer this terminology to “the use of the saints,” let him first of all
show us in his statement what saints he says there are who declared the Maker of all things
to be a product and a creature, and whom he follows in this audacity of phrase. The Church
knows as saints those whose hearts were divinely guided by the Holy Spirit,—patriarchs,
lawgivers, prophets, evangelists, apostles. If any among these is found to declare in his inspired
words that God over all, Who “upholds all things with the word of His power,” and
grasps with His hand all things that are, and by Himself called the universe into being by
the mere act of His will, is a thing created and a product, he will stand excused, as following,
as he says, the “use of the saints527” in proceeding to formulate such doctrines. But if the
knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is freely placed within the reach of all, and nothing is
forbidden to or hidden from any of those who choose to share in the divine instruction,
how comes it that he endeavours to lead his hearers astray by his misrepresentation of the
Scriptures, referring the term “creature,” applied to the Only-begotten, to “the use of the
saints”? For that by Him all things were made, you may hear almost from the whole of their
holy utterance, from Moses and the prophets and apostles who come after him, whose particular
expressions it would be tedious here to set forth. Enough for our purpose, with the
others, and above the others, is the sublime John, where in the preface to his discourse on
the Divinity of the Only-begotten he proclaims aloud the fact that there is none of the things
that were made which was not made through Him528, a fact which is an incontestable and
positive proof of His being Lord of the creation, not reckoned in the list of created things.
For if all things that are made exist by no other but by Him (and John bears witness that
nothing among the things that are, throughout the creation, was made without Him), who
is so blinded in understanding as not to see in the Evangelist’s proclamation the truth, that

He Who made all the creation is assuredly something else besides the creation? For if all
that is numbered among the things that were made has its being through Him, while He
Himself is “in the beginning,” and is “with God,” being God, and Word, and Life, and Light,
and express Image, and Brightness, and if none of the things that were made throughout
creation is named by the same names—(not Word, not God, not Life, not Light, not Truth,
not express Image, not Brightness, not any of the other names proper to the Deity is to be
found employed of the creation)—then it is clear that He Who is these things is by nature
something else besides the creation, which neither is nor is called any of these things. If,
indeed, there existed in such phrases an identity of names between the creation and its
Maker, he might perhaps be excused for making the name of “creation” also common to
the thing created and to Him Who made it, on the ground of the community of the other
names: but if the characteristics which are contemplated by means of the names, in the
created and in the uncreated nature, are in no case reconcilable or common to both, how
can the misrepresentation of that man fail to be manifest to all, who dares to apply the name
of servitude to Him Who, as the Psalmist declares, “ruleth with His power for ever529,” and
to bring Him Who, as the Apostle says, “in all things hath the pre-eminence530,” to a level
with the servile nature, by means of the name and conception of “creation”? For that all531
the creation is in bondage the great Paul declares532,— he who in the schools above the
heavens was instructed in that knowledge which may not be spoken, learning these things
in that place where every voice that conveys meaning by verbal utterance is still, and where
unspoken meditation becomes the word of instruction, teaching to the purified heart by
means of the silent illumination of the thoughts those truths which transcend speech. If
then on the one hand Paul proclaims aloud “the creation is in bondage,” and on the other
the Only-begotten God is truly Lord and God over all, and John bears witness to the fact
that the whole creation of the things that were made is by Him, how can any one, who is in
any sense whatever numbered among Christians, hold his peace when he sees Eunomius,
by his inconsistent and inconsequent systematizing, degrading to the humble state of the
creature, by means of an identity of name that tends to servitude, that power of Lordship
which surpasses all rule and all authority? And if he says that he has some of the saints who
declared Him to be a slave, or created, or made, or any of these lowly and servile names, lo,
here are the Scriptures. Let him, or some other on his behalf, produce to us one such phrase,
and we will hold our peace. But if there is no such phrase (and there could never be found
in those inspired Scriptures which we believe any such thought as to support this impiety),

what need is there to strive further upon points admitted with one who not only misrepresents
the words of the saints, but even contends against his own definitions? For if the “order
of nature,” as he himself admits, bears additional testimony to the Son’s name by reason of
His being begotten, and thus the correspondence of the name is according to the relation
of the Begotten to the Begetter, how comes it that he wrests the significance of the word
“Son” from its natural application, and changes the relation to “the thing made and its
maker”—a relation which applies not only in the case of the elements of the universe, but
might also be asserted of a gnat or an ant—that in so far as each of these is a thing made,
the relation of its name to its maker is similarly equivalent? The blasphemous nature of his
doctrine is clear, not only from many other passages, but even from those quoted: and as
for that “use of the saints” which he alleges that he follows in these expressions, it is clear
that there is no such use at all.</p>

<head>§2. He then once more excellently, appropriately, and clearly examines and expounds the
passage, “The Lord Created Me.”</head>
<p>Perhaps that passage in the Proverbs might be brought forward against us which the
champions of heresy are wont to cite as a testimony that the Lord was created—the passage,
“The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways, for His works533.” For because these
words are spoken by Wisdom, and the Lord is called Wisdom by the great Paul534, they allege
this passage as though the Only-begotten God Himself, under the name of Wisdom, acknowledges
that He was created by the Maker of all things. I imagine, however, that the godly
sense of this utterance is clear to moderately attentive and painstaking persons, so that, in
the case of those who are instructed in the dark sayings of the Proverbs, no injury is done
to the doctrine of the faith. Yet I think it well briefly to discuss what is to be said on this
subject, that when the intention of this passage is more clearly explained, the heretical doctrine
may have no room for boldness of speech on the ground that it has evidence in the
writing of the inspired author. It is universally admitted that the name of “proverb,” in its
scriptural use, is not applied with regard to the evident sense, but is used with a view to
some hidden meaning, as the Gospel thus gives the name of “proverbs535” to dark and obscure
sayings; so that the “proverb,” if one were to set forth the interpretation of the name
by a definition, is a form of speech which, by means of one set of ideas immediately
presented, points to something else which is hidden, or a form of speech which does not
point out the aim of the thought directly, but gives its instruction by an indirect signification.
Now to this book such a name is especially attached as a title, and the force of the appellation
is at once interpreted in the preface by the wise Solomon. For he does not call the sayings
in this book “maxims,” or “counsels,” or “clear instruction,” but “proverbs,” and proceeds
to add an explanation. What is the force of the signification of this word? “To know,” he
tells us, “wisdom and instruction536”; not setting before us the course of instruction in
wisdom according to the method common in other kinds of learning; he bids a man, on the
other hand537, first to become wise by previous training, and then so to receive the instruction
conveyed by proverb. For he tells us that there are “words of wisdom” which reveal their
aim “by a turn538.” For that which is not directly understood needs some turn for the apprehension
of the thing concealed; and as Paul, when about to exchange the literal sense of the

history for figurative contemplation, says that he will “change his voice539,” so here the
manifestation of the hidden meaning is called by Solomon a “turn of the saying,” as if the
beauty of the thoughts could not be perceived, unless one were to obtain a view of the revealed
brightness of the thought by turning the apparent meaning of the saying round about, as
happens with the plumage with which the peacock is decked behind. For in him, one who
sees the back of his plumage quite despises it for its want of beauty and tint, as a mean sight;
but if one were to turn it round and show him the other view of it, he then sees the varied
painting of nature, the half-circle shining in the midst with its dye of purple, and the golden
mist round the circle ringed round and glistening at its edge with its many rainbow hues.
Since then there is no beauty in what is obvious in the saying (for “all the glory of the king’s
daughter is within540,” shining with its hidden ornament in golden thoughts), Solomon of
necessity suggests to the readers of this book “the turn of the saying,” that thereby they may
“understand a parable and a dark saying, words of the wise and riddles541.” Now as this
proverbial teaching embraces these elements, a reasonable man will not receive any passage
cited from this book, be it never so clear and intelligible at first sight, without examination
and inspection; for assuredly there is some mystical contemplation underlying even those
passages which seem manifest. And if the obvious passages of the work necessarily demand
a somewhat minute scrutiny, how much more do those passages require it where even immediate
apprehension presents to us much that is obscure and difficult?</p>
<p>Let us then begin our examination from the context of the passage in question, and see
whether the reading of the neighbouring clauses gives any clear sense. The discourse describes
Wisdom as uttering certain sayings in her own person. Every student knows what is said in
the passage542 where Wisdom makes counsel her dwelling-place, and calls to her knowledge
and understanding, and says that she has as a possession strength and prudence (while she
is herself called intelligence), and that she walks in the ways of righteousness and has her
conversation in the ways of just judgment, and declares that by her kings reign, and princes
write the decree of equity, and monarchs win possession of their own land. Now every one
will see that the considerate reader will receive none of the phrases quoted without scrutiny
according to the obvious sense. For if by her kings are advanced to their rule, and if from
her monarchy derives its strength, it follows of necessity that Wisdom is displayed to us as
a king-maker, and transfers to herself the blame of those who bear evil rule in their kingdoms.
But we know of kings who in truth advance under the guidance of Wisdom to the rule that
has no end—the poor in spirit, whose possession is the kingdom of heaven543, as the Lord

<pb n="267"/>
promises, Who is the Wisdom of the Gospel: and such also we recognize as the princes who
bear rule over their passions, who are not enslaved by the dominion of sin, who inscribe the
decree of equity upon their own life, as it were upon a tablet. Thus, too, that laudable despotism
which changes, by the alliance of Wisdom, the democracy of the passions into the
monarchy of reason, brings into bondage what were running unrestrained into mischievous
liberty, I mean all carnal and earthly thoughts: for “the flesh lusteth against the Spirit544,”
and rebels against the government of the soul. Of this land, then, such a monarch wins
possession, whereof he was, according to the first creation, appointed as ruler by the Word.</p>
<p>Seeing then that all reasonable men admit that these expressions are to be read in such
a sense as this, rather than in that which appears in the words at first sight, it is consequently
probable that the phrase we are discussing, being written in close connection with them, is
not received by prudent men absolutely and without examination. “If I declare to you,” she
says, “the things that happen day by day, I will remember to recount the things from everlasting:
the Lord created me545.” What, pray, has the slave of the literal text, who sits
listening closely to the sound of the syllables, like the Jews, to say to this phrase? Does not
the conjunction, “If I declare to you the things that happen day by day, the Lord created
me,” ring strangely in the ears of those who listen attentively? as though, if she did not declare
the things that happen day by day, she will by consequence deny absolutely that she was
created. For he who says, “If I declare, I was created,” leaves you by his silence to understand,
“I was not created, if I do not declare.” “The Lord created me,” she says, “in the beginning
of His ways, for His works. He set me up from everlasting, in the beginning, before He made
the earth, before He made the depths, before the springs of the waters came forth, before
the mountains were settled, before all hills, He begetteth me546.” What new order of the
formation of a creature is this? First it is created, and after that it is set up, and then it is
begotten. “The Lord made,” she says, “lands, even uninhabited, and the inhabited extremes
of the earth under heaven547.” Of what Lord does she speak as the maker of land both uninhabited
and inhabited? Of Him surely, who made wisdom. For both the one saying and the
other are uttered by the same person; both that which says, “the Lord created me,” and that
which adds, “the Lord made land, even uninhabited.” Thus the Lord will be the maker
equally of both, of Wisdom herself, and of the inhabited and uninhabited land. What then
are we to make of the saying, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not
anything made548”? For if one and the same Lord creates both Wisdom (which they advise

<pb n="268"/>
us to understand of the Son), and also the particular things which are included in the Creation,
how does the sublime John speak truly, when he says that all things were made by
Him? For this Scripture gives a contrary sound to that of the Gospel, in ascribing to the
Creator of Wisdom the making of land uninhabited and inhabited. So, too, with all that
follows549:—she speaks of a Throne of God set apart upon the winds, and says that the
clouds above are made strong, and the fountains under the heaven sure; and the context
contains many similar expressions, demanding in a marked degree that interpretation by a
minute and clear-sighted intelligence, which is to be observed in the passages already quoted.
What is the throne that is set apart upon the winds? What is the security of the fountains
under the heaven? How are the clouds above made strong? If any one should interpret the
passage with reference to visible objects550, he will find that the facts are at considerable
variance with the words. For who knows not that the extreme parts of the earth under
heaven, by excess in one direction or in the other, either by being too close to the sun’s heat,
or by being too far removed from it, are uninhabitable; some being excessively dry and
parched, other parts superabounding in moisture, and chilled by frost, and that only so
much is inhabited as is equally removed from the extreme of each of the two opposite conditions?
But if it is the midst of the earth that is occupied by man, how does the proverb say
that the extremes of the earth under heaven are inhabited? Again, what strength could one
perceive in the clouds, that that passage may have a true sense, according to its apparent
intention, which says that the clouds above have been made strong? For the nature of cloud
is a sort of rather slight vapour diffused through the air, which, being light, by reason of its
great subtilty, is borne on the breath of the air, and, when forced together by compression,
falls down through the air that held it up, in the form of a heavy drop of rain. What then is
the strength in these, which offer no resistance to the touch? For in the cloud you may discern
the slight and easily dissolved character of air. Again, how is the Divine throne set apart on
the winds that are by nature unstable? And as for her saying at first that she is “created,” finally,
that she is “begotten,” and between these two utterances that she is “set up,” what account
of this could any one profess to give that would agree with the common and obvious
sense? The point also on which a doubt was previously raised in our argument, the declaring,
that is, of the things that happen day by day, and the remembering to recount the things
from everlasting, is, as it were, a condition of Wisdom’s assertion that she was created by
God.</p>
<p>Thus, since it has been clearly shown by what has been said, that no part of this passage
is such that its language should be received without examination and reflection, it may be
well, perhaps, as with the rest, so not to interpret the text, “The Lord created me,” according
<note type="footnote">549 Cf. Prov. viii. 27–8 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">550 Or “according to the apparent sense.”</note>

<pb n="269"/>
to that sense which immediately presents itself to us from the phrase, but to seek with all
attention and care what is to be piously understood from the utterance. Now, to apprehend
perfectly the sense of the passage before us, would seem to belong only to those who search
out the depths by the aid of the Holy Spirit, and know how to speak in the Spirit the divine
mysteries: our account, however, will only busy itself with the passage in question so far as
not to leave its drift entirely unconsidered. What, then, is our account? It is not, I think,
possible that that wisdom which arises in any man from divine illumination should come
alone, apart from the other gifts of the Spirit, but there must needs enter in therewith also
the grace of prophecy. For if the apprehension of the truth of the things that are is the peculiar
power of wisdom, and prophecy includes the clear knowledge of the things that are
about to be, one would not be possessed of the gift of wisdom in perfection, if he did not
further include in his knowledge, by the aid of prophecy, the future likewise. Now, since it
is not mere human wisdom that is claimed for himself by Solomon, who says, “God hath
taught me wisdom551,” and who, where he says “all my words are spoken from God552,”
refers to God all that is spoken by himself, it might be well in this part of the Proverbs to
trace out the prophecy that is mingled with his wisdom. But we say that in the earlier part
of the book, where he says that “Wisdom has builded herself a house553,” he refers darkly
in these words to the preparation of the flesh of the Lord: for the trite Wisdom did not dwell
in another’s building, but built for Itself that dwelling-place from the body of the Virgin.
Here, however, he adds to his discourse554 that which of both is made one—of the house,
I mean, and of the Wisdom which built the house, that is to say, of the Humanity and of
the Divinity that was commingled with man555; and to each of these he applies suitable and
fitting terms, as you may see to be the case also in the Gospels, where the discourse, proceeding
as befits its subject, employs the more lofty and divine phraseology to indicate the
Godhead, and that which is humble and lowly to indicate the Manhood. So we may see in
this passage also Solomon prophetically moved, and delivering to us in its fulness the mystery

of the two natures, from which the “communicatio idiomatum” results, is distinct from that of the preparation
for the Nativity, not to insist upon the order in which, as he conceives, they are set forth in the book of Proverbs.</note>

of the Incarnation556. For we speak first of the eternal power and energy of Wisdom; and
here the evangelist, to a certain extent, agrees with him in his very words. For as the latter
in his comprehensive557 phrase proclaimed Him to be the cause and Maker of all things, so
Solomon says that by Him were made those individual things which are included in the
whole. For he tells us that God by Wisdom established the earth, and in understanding
prepared the heavens, and all that follows these in order, keeping to the same sense: and
that he might not seem to pass over without mention the gift of excellence in men, he again
goes on to say, speaking in the person of Wisdom, the words we mentioned a little earlier;
I mean, “I made counsel my dwelling-place, and knowledge, and understanding558,” and
all that relates to instruction in intellect and knowledge.</p>
<p>After recounting these and the like matters, he proceeds to introduce also his teaching
concerning the dispensation with regard to man, why the Word was made flesh. For seeing
that it is clear to all that God Who is over all has in Himself nothing as a thing created or
imported, not power nor wisdom, nor light, nor word, nor life, nor truth, nor any at all of
those things which are contemplated in the fulness of the Divine bosom (all which things
the Only-begotten God is, Who is in the bosom of the Father559, the name of “creation”
could not properly be applied to any of those things which are contemplated in God, so that
the Son Who is in the Father, or the Word Who is in the Beginning, or the Light Who is in
the Light, or the Life Who is in the Life, or the Wisdom Who is in the Wisdom, should say,
“the Lord created me.” For if the Wisdom of God is created (and Christ is the Power of God
and the Wisdom of God560), God, it would follow, has His Wisdom as a thing imported,
receiving afterwards, as the result of making, something which He had not at first. But surely
He Who is in the bosom of the Father does not permit us to conceive the bosom of the
Father as ever void of Himself. He Who is in the beginning is surely not of the things which
come to be in that bosom from without, but being the fulness of all good, He is conceived
as being always in the Father, not waiting to arise in Him as the result of creation, so that
the Father should not be conceived as at any time void of good, but He Who is conceived
as being in the eternity of the Father’s Godhead is always in Him, being Power, and Life,
and Truth, and Wisdom, and the like. Accordingly the words “created me” do not proceed
from the Divine and immortal nature, but from that which was commingled with it in the
Incarnation from our created nature. How comes it then that the same, called wisdom, and
understanding, and intelligence, establishes the earth, and prepares the heavens, and breaks

up the deeps, and yet is here “created for the beginning of His works561”? Such a dispensation,
he tells us, is not set forward without great cause. But since men, after receiving the commandment
of the things we should observe, cast away by disobedience the grace of memory,
and became forgetful, for this cause, “that I may declare to you the things that happen day
by day for your salvation, and may put you in mind by recounting the things from everlasting,
which you have forgotten (for it is no new gospel that I now proclaim, but I labour at your
restoration to your first estate),—for this cause I was created, Who ever am, and need no
creation in order to be; so that I am the beginning of ways for the works of God, that is for
men. For the first way being destroyed, there must needs again be consecrated for the wanderers
a new and living way562, even I myself, Who am the way.” And this view, that the
sense of “created me” has reference to the Humanity, the divine apostle more clearly sets
before us by his own words when he charges us, “Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ563,” and
also where (using the same word) he says, “Put on the new man which after God is created.
564” For if the garment of salvation is one, and that is Christ, one cannot say that “the
new man, which after God is created,” is any other than Christ, but it is clear that he who
has “put on Christ” has “put on the new man which after God is created.” For actually He
alone is properly named “the new man,” Who did not appear in the life of man by the known
and ordinary ways of nature, but in His case alone creation, in a strange and special form,
was instituted anew. For this reason he names the same Person, when regarding the wonderful
manner of His birth565, “the new man, which after God is created,” and, when looking
to the Divine nature, which was blended566 in the creation of this “new man,” he calls Him
“Christ”: so that the two names (I mean the name of “Christ” and the name of “the new
man which after God is created”) are applied to one and the same Person.</p>
<p>Since, then, Christ is Wisdom, let the intelligent reader consider our opponent’s account
of the matter, and our own, and judge which is the more pious, which better preserves in
the text those conceptions which are befitting the Divine nature; whether that which declares
the Creator and Lord of all to have been made, and places Him on a level with the creation
that is in bondage, or that rather which looks to the Incarnation, and preserves the due
proportion with regard to our conception alike of the Divinity and of the Humanity, bearing
in mind that the great Paul testifies in favour of our view, who sees in the “new man” creation,
and in the true Wisdom the power of creation. And, further, the order of the passage agrees

with this view of the doctrine it conveys. For if the “beginning of the ways” had not been
created among us, the foundation of those ages for which we look would not have been laid;
nor would the Lord have become for us “the Father of the age to come567,” had not a Child
been born to us, according to Isaiah, and His name been called, both all the other titles
which the prophet gives Him, and withal “The Father of the age to come.” Thus first there
came to pass the mystery wrought in virginity, and the dispensation of the Passion, and
then the wise master-builders of the Faith laid the foundation of the Faith: and this is Christ,
the Father of the age to come, on Whom is built the life of the ages that have no end. And
when this has come to pass, to the end that in each individual believer may be wrought the
divine decrees of the Gospel law, and the varied gifts of the Holy Spirits—(all which the divine
Scripture figuratively names, with a suitable significance, “mountains” and “hills,” calling
righteousness the “mountains” of God, and speaking of His judgments as “deeps568,” and
giving the name of “earth” to that which is sown by the Word and brings forth abundant
fruit; or in that sense in which we are taught by David to understand peace by the “mountains,”
and righteousness by the “hills569”),—Wisdom is begotten in the faithful, and the
saying is found true. For He Who is in those who have received Him, is not yet begotten in
the unbelieving. Thus, that these things may be wrought in us, their Maker must be begotten
in us. For if Wisdom is begotten in us, then in each of us is prepared by God both land, and
land uninhabited,—the land, that which receives the sowing and the ploughing of the Word,
the uninhabited land, the heart cleared of evil inhabitants,—and thus our dwelling will be
upon the extreme parts of the earth. For since in the earth some is depth, and some is surface,
when a man is not buried in the earth, or, as it were, dwelling in a cave by reason of thinking
of things beneath (as is the life of those who live in sin, who “stick fast in the deep mire
where no ground is570,” whose life is truly a pit, as the Psalm says, “let not the pit shut her
mouth upon me571”)—if, I say, a man, when Wisdom is begotten in him, thinks of the things
that are above, and touches the earth only so much as he needs must, such a man inhabits
“the extreme parts of the earth under heavens,” not plunging deep in earthly thought; with
him Wisdom is present, as he prepares in himself heaven instead of earth: and when, by
carrying out the precepts into act, he makes strong for himself the instruction of the clouds
above, and, enclosing the great and widespread sea of wickedness, as it were with a beach,
by his exact conversation, hinders the troubled water from proceeding forth from his mouth;
and if by the grace of instruction he be made to dwell among the fountains, pouring forth

the stream of his discourse with sure caution, that he may not give to any man for drink the
turbid fluid of destruction in place of pure water, and if he be lifted up above all earthly
paths and become aerial in his life, advancing towards that spiritual life which he speaks of
as “the winds,” so that he is set apart to be a throne of Him Who is seated in him (as was
Paul separated for the Gospel to be a chosen vessel to bear the name of God, who, as it is
elsewhere expressed, was made a throne, bearing Him that sat upon him)—when, I say, he
is established in these and like ways, so that he who has already fully made up in himself
the land inhabited by God, now rejoices in gladness that he is made the father, not of wild
and senseless beasts, but of men (and these would be godlike thoughts, which are fashioned
according to the Divine image, by faith in Him Who has been created and begotten, and set
up in us;—and faith, according to the words of Paul, is conceived as the foundation whereby
wisdom is begotten in the faithful, and all the things that I have spoken of are wrought)—then,
I say, the life of the man who has been thus established is truly blessed, for Wisdom is at all
times in agreement with him, and rejoices with him who daily finds gladness in her alone.
For the Lord rejoices in His saints, and there is joy in heaven over those who are being saved,
and Christ, as the father, makes a feast for his rescued son. Though we have spoken hurriedly
of these matters, let the careful man read the original text of the Holy Scripture, and fit its
dark sayings to our reflections, testing whether it is not far better to consider that the
meaning of these dark sayings has this reference, and not that which is attributed to it at
first sight. For it is not possible that the theology of John should be esteemed true, which
recites that all created things are the work of the Word, if in this passage He Who created
Wisdom be believed to have made together with her all other things also. For in that case
all things will not be by her, but she will herself be counted with the things that were made.</p>
<p>And that this is the reference of the enigmatical sayings is clearly revealed by the passage
that follows, which says, “Now therefore hearken unto me, my son: and blessed is he that
keepeth my ways572,” meaning of course by “ways” the approaches to virtue, the beginning
of which is the possession of Wisdom. Who, then, who looks to the divine Scripture, will
not agree that the enemies of the truth are at once impious and slanderous?—impious, because,
so far as in them lies, they degrade the unspeakable glory of the Only-begotten God,
and unite it with the creation, striving to show that the Lord Whose power over all things
is only-begotten, is one of the things that were made by Him: slanderous, because, though
Scripture itself gives them no ground for such opinions, they arm themselves against piety
as though they drew their evidence from that source. Now since they can by no means show
any passage of the Holy Scriptures which leads us to look upon the pre-temporal glory of
the Only-begotten God in conjunction with the subject creation, it is well, these points being
proved, that the tokens of victory over falsehood should be adduced as testimony to the
<note type="footnote">572 Prov. viii. 32 (not verbally agreeing with the LXX.).</note>

<pb n="274"/>
doctrine of godliness, and that sweeping aside these verbal systems of theirs by which they
make the creature answer to the creator, and the thing made to the maker, we should confess,
as the Gospel from heaven teaches us, the well-beloved Son—not a bastard, not a counterfeit;
but that, accepting with the name of Son all that naturally belongs to that name, we should
say that He Who is of Very God is Very God, and that we should believe of Him all that we
behold in the Father, because They are One, and in the one is conceived the other, not
overpassing Him, not inferior to Him, not altered or subject to change in any Divine or excellent
property.</p>

<head>§3. He then shows, from the instance of Adam and Abel, and other examples, the absence of
alienation of essence in the case of the “generate” and “ungenerate.”</head>
<p>Now seeing that Eunomius’ conflict with himself has been made manifest, where he has
been shown to contradict himself, at one time saying, “He ought to be called ‘Son,’ according
to nature, because He is begotten,” at another that, because He is created, He is no more
called “Son,” but a “product,” I think it right that the careful and attentive reader, as it is
not possible, when two statements are mutually at variance, that the truth should be found
equally in both, should reject of the two that which is impious and blasphemous—that, I
mean, with regard to the “creature” and the “product,” and should assent to that only which
is of orthodox tendency, which confesses that the appellation of “Son” naturally attaches to
the Only-begotten God: so that the word of truth would seem to be recommended even by
the voice of its enemies.</p>
<p>I resume my discourse, however, taking up that point of his argument which we originally
set aside. “We do not refuse,” he says, “to call the Son, seeing He is generate, even by the
name of ‘product of generation573,’ since the generated essence itself, and the appellation
of ‘Son,’ make such a relation of words appropriate.” Meanwhile let the reader who is critically
following the argument remember this, that in speaking of the “generated essence” in the
case of the Only-begotten, he by consequence allows us to speak of the “ungenerate essence”
in the case of the Father, so that neither absence of generation, nor generation, can any
longer be supposed to constitute the essence, but the essence must be taken separately, and
its being, or not being begotten, must be conceived separately by means of the peculiar attributes
contemplated in it. Let us, however, consider more carefully his argument on this
point. He says that an essence has been begotten, and that the name of this generated essence
is “Son.” Well, at this point our argument will convict that of our opponents on two grounds,
first, of an attempt at knavery, secondly, of slackness in their attempt against ourselves. For
he is playing the knave when he speaks of “generation of essence,” in order to establish his
opposition between the essences, when once they are divided in respect of a difference of
nature between “generate” and “ungenerate”: while the slackness of their attempt is shown
by the very positions their knavery tries to establish. For he who says the essence is generate,
clearly defines generation as being something else distinct from the essence, so that the significance
of generation cannot be assigned to the word “essence.” For he has not in this
passage represented the matter as he often does, so as to say that generation is itself the essence,
but acknowledges that the essence is generated, so that there is produced in his
<note type="footnote">573 γέννημα. This word, in what follows, is sometimes translated simply by the word “product,” where it is
not contrasted with ποίημα (the “product of making”), or where the argument depends especially upon its
grammatical form (which indicates that the thing denoted is the result of a process), rather than upon the idea
of the particular process.</note>

<pb n="276"/>
readers a distinct notion in the case of each word: for one conception arises in him who
hears that it was generated, and another is called up by the name of “essence.” Our argument
may be made clearer by example. The Lord says in the Gospel574 that a woman, when her
travail is drawing near, is in sorrow, but afterwards rejoices in gladness because a man is
born into the world. As then in this passage we derive from the Gospel two distinct conceptions,—
one the birth which we conceive to be by way of generation, the other that which
results from the birth (for the birth is not the man, but the man is by the birth),—so here
too, when Eunomius confesses that the essence was generated, we learn by the latter word
that the essence comes from something, and by the former we conceive that subject itself
which has its real being from something. If then the signification of essence is one thing,
and the word expressing generation suggests to us another conception, their clever contrivances
are quite gone to ruin, like earthen vessels hurled one against the other, and mutually
smashed to pieces. For it will no longer be possible for them, if they apply the opposition
of “generate” and “ungenerate” to the essence of the Father and the Son, to apply at the same
time to the things themselves the mutual conflict between these names575. For as it is confessed
by Eunomius that the essence is generate (seeing that the example from the Gospel
explains the meaning of such a phrase, where, when we hear that a man is generated, we do
not conceive the man to be the same thing as his generation, but receive a separate conception
in each of the two words), heresy will surely no longer be permitted to express by such words
her doctrine of the difference of the essences. In order, however, that our account of these
matters may be cleared up as far as possible, let us once more discuss the point in the following
way. He Who framed the universe made the nature of man with all things in the beginning,
and after Adam was made, He then appointed for men the law of generation one from
another, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply576.” Now while Abel came into existence by way
of generation, what reasonable man would deny that, in the actual sense of human generation,
Adam existed ungenerately? Yet the first man had in himself the complete definition of
man’s essential nature, and he who was generated of him was enrolled under the same essential
name. But if the essence that was generated was made anything other than that which
was not generated, the same essential name would not apply to both: for of those things
whose essence is different, the essential name also is not the same. Since, then, the essential
nature of Adam and of Abel is marked by the same characteristics, we must certainly agree
that one essence is in both, and that the one and the other are exhibited in the same nature.
<note type="footnote">574 Cf. S. John xvi. 21</note>
<note type="footnote">575 If, that is, they speak of the “generated essence” in contra-distinction to “ungenerate essence” they are
precluded from saying that the essence of the Son is that He is begotten, and that the essence of the Father is
that He is ungenerate: that which constitutes the essence cannot be made an epithet of the essence.</note>
<note type="footnote">576 Gen. i. 28.</note>

<pb n="277"/>
For Adam and Abel are both one so far as the definition of their nature is concerned, but
are distinguished one from the other without confusion by the individual attributes observed
in each of them. We cannot therefore properly say that Adam generated another essence
besides himself, but rather that of himself he generated another self, with whom was produced
the whole definition of the essence of him who generated him. What, then, we learn in the
case of human nature by means of the inferential guidance afforded to us by the definition,
this I think we ought to take for our guidance also to the pure apprehension of the Divine
doctrines. For when we have shaken off from the Divine and exalted doctrines all carnal
and material notions, we shall be most surely led by the remaining conception, when it is
purged of such ideas, to the lofty and unapproachable heights. It is confessed even by our
adversaries that God, Who is over all, both is and is called the Father of the Only-begotten,
and they moreover give to the Only-begotten God, Who is of the Father, the name of “begotten,”
by reason of His being generated. Since then among men the word “father” has
certain significances attaching to it, from which the pure nature is alien, it behoves a man
to lay aside all material conceptions which enter in by association with the carnal significance
of the word “father,” and to form in the case of the God and Father a conception befitting
the Divine nature, expressive only of the reality of the relationship. Since, therefore, in the
notion of a human father there is included not only all that the flesh suggests to our thoughts,
but a certain notion of interval is also undoubtedly conceived with the idea of human fatherhood,
it would be well, in the case of the Divine generation, to reject, together with bodily
pollution, the notion of interval also, that so what properly belongs to matter may be completely
purged away, and the transcendent generation may be clear, not only from the idea
of passion, but from that of interval. Now he who says that God is a Father will unite with
the thought that God is, the further thought that He is something: for that which has its
being from some beginning, certainly also derives from something the beginning of its being,
whatever it is: but He in Whose case being had no beginning, has not His beginning from
anything, even although we contemplate in Him some other attribute than simple existence.
Well, God is a Father. It follows that He is what He is from eternity: for He did not become,
but is a Father: for in God that which was, both is and will be. On the other hand, if He once
was not anything, then He neither is nor will be that thing: for He is not believed to be the
Father of a Being such that it may be piously asserted that God once existed by Himself
without that Being. For the Father is the Father of Life, and Truth, and Wisdom, and Light,
and Sanctification, and Power, and all else of a like kind that the Only-begotten is or is called.
Thus when the adversaries allege that the Light “once was not,” I know not to which the
greater injury is done, whether to the Light, in that the Light is not, or to Him that has the
Light, in that He has not the Light. So also with Life and Truth and Power, and all the other
characters in which the Only-begotten fills the Father’s bosom, being all things in His own
fulness. For the absurdity will be equal either way, and the impiety against the Father will

<pb n="278"/>
equal the blasphemy against the Son: for in saying that the Lord “once was not,” you will
not merely assert the non-existence of Power, but you will be saying that the Power of God,
Who is the Father of the Power, “was not.” Thus the assertion made by your doctrine that
the Son “once was not,” establishes nothing else than a destitution of all good in the case of
the Father. See to what an end these wise men’s acuteness leads, how by them the word of
the Lord is made good, which says, “He that despiseth Me despiseth Him that sent Me577:”
for by the very arguments by which they despise the existence at any time of the Only-begotten,
they also dishonour the Father, stripping off by their doctrine from the Father’s glory
every good name and conception.</p>

<head>§4. He thus shows the oneness of the Eternal Son with the Father the identity of essence and
the community of nature (wherein is a natural inquiry into the production of wine), and
that the terms “Son” and “product” in the naming of the Only-Begotten include a like idea
of relationship.</head>
<p>What has been said, therefore, has clearly exposed the slackness which is to be found
in the knavery of our author, who, while he goes about to establish the opposition of the
essence of the Only-begotten to that of the Father, by the method of calling the one “ungenerate,”
and the other “generate,” stands convicted of playing the fool with his inconsistent
arguments. For it was shown from his own words, first, that the name of “essence” means
one thing, and that of “generation” another; and next, that there did not come into existence,
with the Son, any new and different essence besides the essence of the Father, but that what
the Father is as regards the definition of His nature, that also He is Who is of the Father, as
the nature does not change into diversity in the Person of the Son, according to the truth
of the argument displayed by our consideration of Adam and Abel. For as, in that instance,
he that was not generated after a like sort was yet, so far as concerns the definition of essence,
the same with him that was generated, and Abel’s generation did not produce any change
in the essence, so, in the case of these pure doctrines, the Only-begotten God did not, by
His own generation, produce in Himself any change in the essence of Him Who is ungenerate
(coming forth, as the Gospel says, from the Father, and being in the Father,) but is, according
to the simple and homely language of the creed we profess, “Light of Light, very God of very
God,” the one being all that the other is, save being that other. With regard, however, to the
aim for the sake of which he carries on this system-making, I think there is no need for me
at present to express any opinion, whether it is audacious and dangerous, or a thing allowable
and free from danger, to transform the phrases which are employed to signify the Divine
nature from one to another, and to call Him Who is generated by the name of “product of
generation.”</p>
<p>I let these matters pass, that my discourse may not busy itself too much in the strife
against lesser points, and neglect the greater; but I say that we ought carefully to consider
the question whether the natural relation does introduce the use of these terms: for this
surely Eunomius asserts, that with the affinity of the appellations there is also asserted an
essential relationship. For he would not say, I presume, that the mere names themselves,
apart from the sense of the things signified, have any mutual relation or affinity; but all
discern the relationship or diversity of the appellations by the meanings which the words
express. If, therefore, he confesses that “the Son” has a natural relation with “the Father,”
let us leave the appellations, and consider the force that is found in their significations,
whether in their affinity we discern diversity of essence, or that which is kindred and characteristic.
To say that we find diversity is downright madness. For how does something
without kinship or community “preserve order,” connected and conformable, in the names,

<pb n="280"/>
where “the generated essence itself,” as he says, “and the appellation of ‘Son,’ make such a
relation of words appropriate”? If, on the other hand, he should say that these appellations
signify relationship, he will necessarily appear in the character of an advocate of the community
of essence, and as maintaining the fact that by affinity of names is signified also the
connection of subjects: and this he often does in his composition without being aware of
it578. For, by the arguments wherewith he endeavours to destroy the truth, he is often himself
unwittingly drawn into an advocacy of the very doctrines against which he is contending.
Some such thing the history tells us concerning Saul, that once, when moved with wrath
against the prophets, he was overcome by grace, and was found as one of the inspired, (the
Spirit of prophecy willing, as I suppose, to instruct the apostate by means of himself,) whence
the surprising nature of the event became a proverb in his after life, as the history records
such an expression by way of wonder, “Is Saul also among the prophets579?”</p>
<p>At what point, then, does Eunomius assent to the truth? When he says that the Lord
Himself, “being the Son of the living God, not being ashamed of His birth from the Virgin,
often named Himself, in His own sayings, ‘the Son of Man’”? For this phrase we also allege
for proof of the community of essence, because the name of “Son” shows the community
of nature to be equal in both cases. For as He is called the Son of Man by reason of the
kindred of His flesh to her of whom He was born, so also He is conceived, surely, as the Son
of God, by reason of the connection of His essence with that from which He has His existence,
and this argument is the greatest weapon of the truth. For nothing so clearly points to Him
Who is the “mediator between God and man580” (as the great Apostle called Him), as the
name of “Son,” equally applicable to either nature, Divine or Human. For the same Person
is Son of God, and was made, in the Incarnation, Son of Man, that, by His communion with
each, He might link together by Himself what were divided by nature. Now if, in becoming
Son of Man, he were without participation in human nature, it would be logical to say that
neither does He share in the Divine essence, though He is Son of God. But if the whole
compound nature of man was in Him (for He was “in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin”581), it is surely necessary to believe that every property of the transcendent essence
is also in Him, as the Word “Son” claims for Him both alike—the Human in the man,
but in the God the Divine.</p>
<p>If then the appellations, as Eunomius says, indicate relationship, and the existence of
relationship is observed in the things, not in the mere sound of the words (and by things I
mean the things conceived in themselves, if it be not over-bold thus to speak of the Son and
<note type="footnote">578 Oehler’s punctuation is here slightly altered.</note>

the Father), who would deny that the very champion of blasphemy has by his own action
been dragged into the advocacy of orthodoxy, overthrowing by his own means his own ar-
guments, and proclaiming community of essence in the case of the Divine doctrines? For
the argument that he unwillingly casts into the scale on the side of truth does not speak
falsely as regards this point,—that He would not have been called Son if the natural conception
of the names did not verify this calling. For as a bench is not called the son of the
workman, and no sane man would say that the builder engendered the house, and we do
not say that the vineyard is the “product582” of the vine-dresser, but call what a man makes
his work, and him who is begotten of him the son of a man, (in order, I suppose, that the
proper meaning might be attached by means of the names to the respective subjects,) so
too, when we are taught that the Only-begotten is Son of God, we do not by this appellation
understand a creature of God, but what the word “Son” in its signification really displays.
And even though wine be named by Scripture the “product583” of the vine, not even so will
our argument with regard to the orthodox doctrine suffer by this identity of name. For we
do not call wine the “product” of the oak, nor the acorn the “product” of the vine, but we
use the word only if there is some natural community between the “product” and that from
which it comes. For the moisture in the vine, which is drawn out from the root through the
stem by the pith, is, in its natural power, water: but, as it passes in orderly sequence along
the ways of nature, and flows from the lowest to the highest, it changes to the quality of
wine, a change to which the rays of the sun contribute in some degree, which by their warmth
draw out the moisture from the depth to the shoots, and by a proper and suitable process
of ripening make the moisture wine: so that, so far as their nature is concerned, there is no
difference between the moisture that exists in the vine and the wine that is produced from
it. For the one form of moisture comes from the other, and one could not say that the cause
of wine is anything else than the moisture which naturally exists in the shoots. But, so far
as moisture is concerned, the differences of quality produce no alteration, but are found
when some peculiarity discerns the moisture which is in the form of wine from that which
is in the shoots, one of the two forms being accompanied by astringency, or sweetness, or
sourness, so that in substance the two are the same, but are distinguished by qualitative
differences. As, therefore, when we hear from Scripture that the Only-begotten God is Son
of man, we learn by the kindred expressed in the name His kinship with true man, so even,
if the Son be called, in the adversaries’ phrase, a “product,” we none the less learn, even by
this name, His kinship in essence with Him that has “produced584” Him, by the fact that
wine, which is called the “product” of the vine has been found not to be alien, as concerns

<pb n="282"/>
the idea of moisture, from the natural power that resides in the vine. Indeed, if one were
judiciously to examine the things that are said by our adversaries, they tend to our doctrine,
and their sense cries out against their own fabrications, as they strive at all points to establish
their “difference in essence.” Yet it is by no means an easy matter to conjecture whence they
were led to such conceptions. For if the appellation of “Son” does not merely signify “being
from something,” but by its signification presents to us specially, as Eunomius himself says,
relationship in point of nature, and wine is not called the “product” of an oak, and those
“products” or “generation of vipers585,” of which the Gospel somewhere speaks, are snakes
and not sheep, it is clear, that in the case of the Only-begotten also, the appellation of “Son”
or of “product” would not convey the meaning of relationship to something of another kind:
but even if, according to our adversaries’ phrase, He is called a “product of generation,” and
the name of “Son,” as they confess, has reference to nature, the Son is surely of the essence
of Him Who has generated or “produced” Him, not of that of some other among the things
which we contemplate as external to that nature. And if He is truly from Him, He is not
alien from all that belongs to Him from Whom He is, as in the other cases too it was shown
that all that has its existence from anything by way of generation is clearly of the same kind
as that from whence it came.</p>

<head>§5. He discusses the incomprehensibility of the Divine essence, and the saying to the woman
of Samaria, “Ye worship ye know not what.”</head>
<p>Now if any one should ask for some interpretation, and description, and explanation
of the Divine essence, we are not going to deny that in this kind of wisdom we are unlearned,
acknowledging only so much as this, that it is not possible that that which is by nature infinite
should be comprehended in any conception expressed by words. The fact that the Divine
greatness has no limit is proclaimed by prophecy, which declares expressly that of His
splendour, His glory, His holiness, “there is no end586:” and if His surroundings have no
limit, much more is He Himself in His essence, whatever it may be, comprehended by no
limitation in any way. If then interpretation by way of words and names implies by its
meaning some sort of comprehension of the subject, and if, on the other hand, that which
is unlimited cannot be comprehended, no one could reasonably blame us for ignorance, if
we are not bold in respect of what none should venture upon. For by what name can I describe
the incomprehensible? by what speech can I declare the unspeakable? Accordingly,
since the Deity is too excellent and lofty to be expressed in words, we have learnt to honour
in silence what transcends speech and thought: and if he who “thinketh more highly than
he ought to think587,” tramples upon this cautious speech of ours making a jest of our ignorance
of things incomprehensible, and recognizes a difference of unlikeness in that which is
without figure, or limit, or size, or quantity (I mean in the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit), and brings forward to reproach our ignorance that phrase which is continually alleged
by the disciples of deceit, “‘Ye worship ye know not what588,’ if ye know not the essence of
that which ye worship,” we shall follow the advice of the prophet, and not fear the reproach
of fools589, nor be led by their reviling to talk boldly of things unspeakable, making that
unpractised speaker Paul our teacher in the mysteries that transcend knowledge, who is so
far from thinking that the Divine nature is within the reach of human perception, that he
calls even the judgments of God “unsearchable,” and His ways “past finding out590,” and
affirms that the things promised to them that love Him, for their good deeds done in this
life, are above comprehension so that it is not possible to behold them with the eye, nor to
receive them by hearing, nor to contain them in the heart591. Learning this, therefore, from
Paul, we boldly declare that, not only are the judgments of God too high for those who try
to search them out, but that the ways also that lead to the knowledge of Him are even until
<note type="footnote">586 Cf. Ps. cxlv. 3</note>

<pb n="284"/>
now untrodden and impassable. For this is what we understand that the Apostle wishes to
signify, when he calls the ways that lead to the incomprehensible “past finding out,” showing
by the phrase that that knowledge is unattainable by human calculations, and that no one
ever yet set his understanding on such a path of reasoning, or showed any trace or sign of
an approach, by way of perception, to the things incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Learning these things, then, from the lofty words of the Apostle, we argue, by the passage
quoted, in this way:—If His judgments cannot be searched out, and His ways are not traced,
and the promise of His good things transcends every representation that our conjectures
can frame, by how much more is His actual Godhead higher and loftier, in respect of being
unspeakable and unapproachable, than those attributes which are conceived as accompanying
it, whereof the divinely instructed Paul declares that there is no knowledge:—and by this
means we confirm in ourselves the doctrine they deride, confessing ourselves inferior to
them in the knowledge of those things which are beyond the range of knowledge, and declare
that we really worship what we know. Now we know the loftiness of the glory of Him Whom
we worship, by the very fact that we are not able by reasoning to comprehend in our thoughts
the incomparable character of His greatness; and that saying of our Lord to the Samaritan
woman, which is brought forward against us by our enemies, might more properly be addressed
to them. For the words, “Ye worship ye know not what,” the Lord speaks to the
Samaritan woman, prejudiced as she was by corporeal ideas in her opinions concerning
God: and to her the phrase well applies, because the Samaritans, thinking that they worship
God, and at the same time supposing the Deity to be corporeally settled in place, adore Him
in name only, worshipping something else, and not God. For nothing is Divine that is conceived
as being circumscribed, but it belongs to the Godhead to be in all places, and to pervade
all things, and not to be limited by anything: so that those who fight against Christ find the
phrase they adduce against us turned into an accusation of themselves. For, as the Samaritans,
supposing the Deity to be compassed round by some circumscription of place, were rebuked
by the words they heard, “‘Ye worship ye know not what,’ and your service is profitless to
you, for a God that is deemed to be settled in any place is no God,”—so one might well say
to the new Samaritans, “In supposing the Deity to be limited by the absence of generation,
as it were by some local limit, ‘ye worship ye know not what,’ doing service to Him indeed
as God, but not knowing that the infinity of God exceeds all the significance and comprehension
that names can furnish.”</p>

<head>§6. Thereafter he expounds the appellation of “Son,” and of “product of generation,” and very
many varieties of “sons,” of God, of men, of rams, of perdition, of light, and of day.</head>
<p>But our discourse has diverged too far from the subject before us, in following out the
questions which arise from time to time by way of inference. Let us therefore once more
resume its sequence, as I imagine that the phrase under examination has been sufficiently
shown, by what we have said, to be contradictory not only to the truth, but also to itself. For
if, according to their view, the natural relation to the Father is established by the appellation
of “the Son,” and so with that of the “product of generation” to Him Who has begotten Him
(as these men’s wisdom falsely models the terms significant of the Divine nature into a
verbal arrangement, according to some grammatical frivolity), no one could longer doubt
that the mutual relation of the names which is established by nature is a proof of their
kindred, or rather of their identity of essence. But let not our discourse merely turn about
our adversaries’ words, that the orthodox doctrine may not seem to gain the victory only
by the weakness of those who fight against it, but appear to have an abundant supply of
strength in itself. Let the adverse argument, therefore, be strengthened as much as may be
by us ourselves with more energetic advocacy, that the superiority of our force may be recognized
with full confidence, as we bring to the unerring test of truth those arguments also
which our adversaries have omitted. He who contends on behalf of our adversaries will
perhaps say that the name of “Son,” or “product of generation,” does not by any means establish
the fact of kindred in nature. For in Scripture the term “child of wrath592” is used,
and “son of perdition593,” and “product of a viper594;” and in such names surely no community
of nature is apparent. For Judas, who is called “the son of perdition,” is not in his
substance the same with perdition, according to what we understand by the word595. For
the signification of the “man” in Judas is one thing, and that of “perdition” is another. And
the argument may be established equally from an opposite instance. For those who are called
in a certain sense “children of light,” and “children of the day596,” are not the same with
light and day in respect of the definition of their nature, and the stones are made Abraham’s
children597 when they claim their kindred with him by faith and works; and those who are
“led by the Spirit of God,” as the Apostle says, are called “Sons of God598,” without being

the same with God in respect of nature; and one may collect many such instances from the
inspired Scripture, by means of which deceit, like some image decked with the testimonies
of Scripture, masquerades in the likeness of truth.</p>
<p>Well, what do we say to this? The divine Scripture knows how to use the word “Son”
in both senses, so that in some cases such an appellation is derived from nature, in others
it is adventitious and artificial. For when it speaks of “sons of men,” or “sons of rams599,”
it marks the essential relation of that which is begotten to that from which it has its being:
but when it speaks of “sons of power,” or “children of God,” it presents to us that kinship
which is the result of choice. And, moreover, in the opposite sense, too, the same persons
are called “sons of Eli,” and “sons of Belial600,” the appellation of “sons” being easily adapted
to either idea. For when they are called “sons of Eli,” they are declared to have natural relationship
to him, but in being called “sons of Belial,” they are reproved for the wickedness
of their choice, as no longer emulating their father in their life, but addicting their own
purpose to sin. In the case, then, of this lower nature of ours, and of the things with which
we are concerned, by reason of human nature being equally inclined to either side (I mean,
to vice and to virtue), it is in our power to become sons either of night or of day, while our
nature yet remains, so far as the chief part of it is concerned, within its proper limits. For
neither is he who by sin becomes a child of wrath alienated from his human generation, nor
does he who by choice addicts himself to good reject his human origin by the refinement
of his habits, but, while their nature in each case remains the same, the differences of their
purpose assume the names of their relationship, according as they become either children
of God by virtue, or of the opposite by vice.</p>
<p>But how does Eunomius, in the case of the divine doctrines at least—he who “preserves
the natural order” (for I will use our author’s very words), “and abides by those things which
are known to us from the beginning, and does not refuse to call Him that is begotten by the
name of ‘product of generation,’ since the generated essence itself” (as he says) “and the
appellation of ‘Son’ makes such a relation of words appropriate”,—how does he alienate the
Begotten from essential kindred with Him that begat Him? For in the case of those who are
called “sons” or “products” by way of reproach, or again where some praise accompanies
such names, we cannot say that any one is called “a child of wrath,” being at the same time
actually begotten by wrath; nor again had any one the day for his mother, in a corporeal
sense, that he should be called its son; but it is the difference of their will which gives occasion
for names of such relationship. Here, however, Eunomius says, “we do not refuse to call the
Son, seeing He is begotten, by the name of ‘product of generation,’ since the generated es-

sence,” he tells us, “and the appellation of ‘Son,’ makes such a relation of words appropriate.”
If, then, he confesses that such a relation of words is made appropriate by the fact that the
Son is really a “product of generation,” how is it opportune to assign such a rationale of
names, alike to those which are used inexactly by way of metaphor, and to those where the
natural relation, as Eunomius tells us, makes such a use of names appropriate? Surely such
an account is true only in the case of those whose nature is a border-land between virtue
and vice, where one often shares in turn opposite classes of names, becoming a child, now
of light, then again of darkness, by reason of affinity to the good or to its opposite. But where
contraries have no place, one could no longer say that the word “Son” is applied metaphorically,
in like manner as in the case of those who by choice appropriate the title to themselves.
For one could not arrive at this view, that, as a man casting off the works of darkness becomes,
by his decent life, a child of light, so too the Only-begotten God received the more honourable
name as the result of a change from the inferior state. For one who is a man becomes a son
of God by being joined to Christ by spiritual generation: but He Who by Himself makes the
man to be a son of God does not need another Son to bestow on Him the adoption of a son,
but has the name also of that which He is by nature. A man himself changes himself, exchanging
the old man for the new; but to what shall God be changed, so that He may receive
what He has not? A man puts off himself, and puts on the Divine nature; but what does He
put off, or in what does He array Himself, Who is always the same? A man becomes a son
of God, receiving what he has not, and laying aside what he has; but He Who has never been
in the state of vice has neither anything to receive nor anything to relinquish. Again, the
man may be on the one hand truly called some one’s son, when one speaks with reference
to his nature; and, on the other hand, he may be so called inexactly, when the choice of his
life imposes the name. But God, being One Good, in a single and uncompounded nature,
looks ever the same way, and is never changed by the impulse of choice, but always wishes
what He is, and is, assuredly, what He wishes: so that He is in both respects properly and
truly called Son of God, since His nature contains the good, and His choice also is never
severed from that which is more excellent, so that this word is employed, without inexactness,
as His name. Thus there is no room for these arguments (which, in the person of our adversaries,
we have been opposing to ourselves), to be brought forward by our adversaries
as a demurrer to the affinity in respect of nature.</p>

<head>§7. Then he ends the book with an exposition of the Divine and Human names of the Only-
Begotten, and a discussion of the terms “generate” and “ungenerate.”</head>
<p>But as, I know not how or why, they hate and abhor the truth, they give Him indeed
the name of “Son,” but in order to avoid the testimony which this word would give to the
community of essence, they separate the word from the sense included in the name, and
concede to the Only-begotten the name of “Son” as an empty thing, vouchsafing to Him
only the mere sound of the word. That what I say is true, and that I am not taking a false
aim at the adversaries’ mark, may be clearly learnt from the actual attacks they make upon
the truth. Such are those arguments which are brought forward by them to establish their
blasphemy, that we are taught by the divine Scriptures many names of the Only-begotten—a
stone, an axe, a rock, a foundation, bread, a vine, a door, a way, a shepherd, a fountain, a
tree, resurrection, a teacher, light, and many such names. But we may not piously use any
of these names of the Lord, understanding it according to its immediate sense. For surely
it would be a most absurd thing to think that what is incorporeal and immaterial, simple,
and without figure, should be fashioned according to the apparent senses of these names,
whatever they may be, so that when we hear of an axe we should think of a particular figure
of iron, or when we hear of light, of the light in the sky, or of a vine, of that which grows by
the planting of shoots, or of any one of the other names, as its ordinary use suggests to us
to think; but we transfer the sense of these names to what better becomes the Divine nature,
and form some other conception, and if we do designate Him thus, it is not as being any of
these things, according to the definition of His nature, but as being called these things while
He is conceived by means of the names employed as something else than the things themselves.
But if such names are indeed truly predicated of the Only-begotten God, without
including the declaration of His nature, they say that, as a consequence, neither should we
admit the signification of “Son,” as it is understood according to the prevailing use, as expressive
of nature, but should find some sense of this word also, different from that which
is ordinary and obvious. These, and others like these, are their philosophical arguments to
establish that the Son is not what He is and is called. Our argument was hastening to a different
goal, namely to show that Eunomius’ new discourse is false and inconsistent, and
argues neither with the truth nor with itself. Since, however, the arguments which we employ
to attack their doctrine are brought into the discussion as a sort of support for their blasphemy601,
it may be well first briefly to discuss his point, and then to proceed to the orderly
examination of his writings.</p>
<note type="footnote">601 The meaning of this seems to be that the Anomoean party make the same charge of “inconsistency” against
the orthodox, which Gregory makes against Eunomius, basing that charge on the fact that the title “Son” is not
interpreted in the same figurative way as the other titles recited. Gregory accordingly proceeds to show why the
name of “Son” stands on a different level from those titles, and is to be treated in a different way.</note>

<pb n="289"/>
<p>What can we say, then, to such things without relevance? That while, as they say, the
names which Scripture applies to the Only-begotten are many, we assert that none of the
other names is closely connected with the reference to Him that begat Him. For we do not
employ the name “Stone,” or “Resurrection,” or “Shepherd,” or “Light,” or any of the rest,
as we do the name “Son of the Father,” with a reference to the God of all. It is possible to
make a twofold division of the signification of the Divine names, as it were by a scientific
rule: for to one class belongs the indication of His lofty and unspeakable glory; the other
class indicates the variety of the providential dispensation: so that, as we suppose, if that
which received His benefits did not exist, neither would those words be applied with respect
to them602 which indicate His bounty. All those on the other hand, that express the attributes
of God, are applied suitably and properly to the Only-begotten God, apart from the objects
of the dispensation. But that we may set forth this doctrine clearly, we will examine the
names themselves. The Lord would not have been called a vine, save for the planting of
those who are rooted in Him, nor a shepherd, had not the sheep of the house of Israel been
lost, nor a physician, save for the sake of them that were sick, nor would He have received
for Himself the rest of these names, had He not made the titles appropriate, in a manner
advantageous with regard to those who were benefited by Him, by some action of His
providence. What need is there to mention individual instances, and to lengthen our argument
upon points that are acknowledged? On the other hand, He is certainly called “Son,”
and “Right Hand,” and “Only-begotten,” and “Word,” and “Wisdom,” and “Power,” and
all other such relative names, as being named together with the Father in a certain relative
conjunction. For He is called the “Power of God,” and the “Right Hand of God,” and the
“Wisdom of God,” and the “Son and Only-begotten of the Father,” and the “Word with
God,” and so of the rest. Thus, it follows from what we have stated, that in each of the names
we are to contemplate some suitable sense appropriate to the subject, so that we may not
miss the right understanding of them, and go astray from the doctrine of godliness. As,
then, we transfer each of the other terms to that sense in which they may be applied to God,
and reject in their case the immediate sense, so as not to understand material light, or a
trodden way, or the bread which is produced by husbandry, or the word that is expressed
by speech, but, instead of these, all those thoughts which present to us the magnitude of the
power of the Word of God,—so, if one were to reject the ordinary and natural sense of the
word “Son,” by which we learn that He is of the same essence as Him that begat Him, he
will of course transfer the name to some more divine interpretation. For since the change
to the more glorious meaning which has been made in each of the other terms has adapted
them to set forth the Divine power, it surely follows that the significance of this name also
<note type="footnote">602 ἐπ᾽ ἀυτῶν: perhaps “with reference to man,” the plural being employed here to denote the race of men,
spoken of in the preceding clause collectively as τὸ εὐεργετόυμενον</note>

<pb n="290"/>
should be transferred to what is loftier. But what more Divine sense could we find in the
appellation of “Son,” if we were to reject, according to our adversaries’ view, the natural relation
to Him that begat Him? I presume no one is so daring in impiety as to think that, in
speech concerning the Divine nature, what is humble and mean is more appropriate than
what is lofty and great. If they can discover, therefore, any sense of more exalted character
than this, so that to be of the nature of the Father seems a thing unworthy to conceive of
the Only-begotten, let them tell us whether they know, in their secret wisdom, anything
more exalted than the nature of the Father, that, in raising the Only-begotten God to this
level, they should lift Him also above His relation to the Father. But if the majesty of the
Divine nature transcends all height, and excels every power that calls forth our wonder,
what idea remains that can carry the meaning of the name “Son” to something greater still?
Since it is acknowledged, therefore, that every significant phrase employed of the Only-begotten,
even if the name be derived from the ordinary use of our lower life, is properly applied
to Him with a difference of sense in the direction of greater majesty, and if it is shown that
we can find no more noble conception of the title “Son” than that which presents to us the
reality of His relationship to Him that begat Him, I think that we need spend no more time
on this topic, as our argument has sufficiently shown that it is not proper to interpret the
title of “Son” in like manner with the other names.</p>
<p>But we must bring back our enquiry once more to the book. It does not become the
same persons “not to refuse” (for I will use their own words) “to call Him that is generated
a ‘product of generation,’ since both the generated essence itself and the appellation of Son
make such a relation of words appropriate,” and again to change the names which naturally
belong to Him into metaphorical interpretations: so that one of two things has befallen
them,—either their first attack has failed, and it is in vain that they fly to “natural order” to
establish the necessity of calling Him that is generated a “product of generation”; or, if this
argument holds good, they will find their second argument brought to nought by what they
have already established. For the person who is called a “product of generation” because He
is generated, cannot, for the very same reason, be possibly called a “product of making,” or
a “product of creation.” For the sense of the several terms differs very widely, and one who
uses his phrases advisedly ought to employ words with due regard to the subject, that we
may not, by improperly interchanging the sense of our phrases, fall into any confusion of
ideas. Hence we call that which is wrought out by a craft the work of the craftsman, and call
him who is begotten by a man that man’s son; and no sane person would call the work a
son, or the son a work; for that is the language of one who confuses and obscures the true
sense by an erroneous use of names. It follows that we must truly affirm of the Only-begotten
one of these two things,—if He is a Son, that He is not to be called a “product of creation,”
and if He is created, that He is alien from the appellation of “Son603,” just as heaven and
<note type="footnote">603 Oehler’s punctuation here seems faulty, and is accordingly not followed.</note>

<pb n="291"/>
sea and earth, and all individual things, being things created, do not assume the name of
“Son.” But since Eunomius bears witness that the Only-begotten God is begotten (and the
evidence of enemies is of additional value for establishing the truth), he surely testifies also,
by saying that He is begotten, to the fact that He is not created. Enough, however, on these
points: for though many arguments crowd upon us, we will be content, lest their number
lead to disproportion, with those we have already adduced on the subject before us.</p>

<head>§1. The fourth book discusses the account of the nature of the “product of generation,” and of
the passionless generation of the Only-Begotten, and the text, “In the beginning was the
Word,” and the birth of the Virgin.</head>
<p>It is, perhaps, time to examine in our discourse that account of the nature of the “product
of generation” which is the subject of his ridiculous philosophizing. He says, then (I will
repeat word for word his beautifully composed argument against the truth):—“Who is so
indifferent and inattentive to the nature of things as not to know, that of all bodies which
are on earth, in their generating and being generated, in their activity and passivity, those
which generate are found on examination to communicate their own essence, and those
which are generated naturally receive the same, inasmuch as the material cause and the
supply which flows in from without are common to both; and the things begotten are generated
by passion, and those which beget, naturally have an action which is not pure, by
reason of their nature being linked with passions of all kinds?” See in what fitting style he
discusses in his speculation the pre-temporal generation of the Word of God that was in
the beginning! he who closely examines the nature of things, bodies on the earth, and material
causes, and passion of things generating and generated, and all the rest of it,—at which
any man of understanding would blush, even were it said of ourselves, if it were our nature,
subject as it is to passion, which is thus exposed to scorn by his words. Yet such is our author’s
brilliant enquiry into nature with regard to the Only-begotten God. Let us lay aside complaints,
however, (for what will sighing do to help us to overthrow the malice of our enemy?)
and make generally known, as best we may, the sense of what we have quoted—concerning
what sort of “product” the speculation was proposed,—that which exists according to the
flesh, or that which is to be contemplated in the Only-begotten God.</p>
<p>As the speculation is two-fold, concerning that life which is Divine, simple, and immaterial,
and concerning that existence which is material and subject to passion, and as the
word “generation” is used of both, we must needs make our distinction sharp and clear, lest
the ambiguity of the term “generation” should in any way pervert the truth. Since, then, the
entrance into being through the flesh is material, and is promoted by passion, while that
which is bodiless, impalpable, without form, and free from any material commixture, is
alien from every condition that admits of passion, it is proper to consider about what sort
of generation we are enquiring—that which is pure and Divine, or that which is subject to
passion and pollution. Now, no one, I suppose, would deny that with regard to the Only-

<pb n="293"/>
begotten God, it is pre-temporal existence that is proposed for the consideration604 of Eunomius’
discourse. Why, then, does he linger over this account of corporeal nature, defiling
our nature by the loathsome presentment of his argument, and setting forth openly the
passions that gather round human generation, while he deserts the subject set before him?
for it was not about this animal generation, that is accomplished by means of the flesh, that
we had any need to learn. Who is so foolish, when he looks on himself, and considers human
nature in himself, as to seek another interpreter of his own nature, and to need to be told
all the unavoidable passions which are included in the thought of bodily generation—that
he who begets is affected in one way, that which is begotten in another—so that the man
should learn from this instruction that he himself begets by means of passion, and that
passion was the beginning of his own generation? For it is all the same whether these things
are passed over or spoken, and whether one publishes these secrets at length, or keeps hidden
in silence things that should be left unsaid, we are not ignorant of the fact that our nature
progresses by way of passion. But what we are seeking is that a clear account should be given
of the exalted and unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, whereby He is believed to
be of the Father.</p>
<p>Now, while this is the enquiry set before him, our new theologian enriches his discourse
with “flowing,” and “passion,” and “material cause,” and some “action” which “is not pure”
from pollution, and all other phrases of this kind605. I know not under what influence it is
that he who says, in the superiority of his wisdom, that nothing incomprehensible is left
beyond his own knowledge, and promises to explain the unspeakable generation of the Son,
leaves the question before him, and plunges like an eel into the slimy mud of his arguments,
after the fashion of that Nicodemus who came by night, who, when our Lord was teaching
him of the birth from above, rushed in thought to the hollow of the womb, and raised a
doubt how one could enter a second time into the womb, with the words, “How can these
things be?606” thinking that he would prove the spiritual birth impossible, by the fact that
an old man could not again be born within his mother’s bowels. But the Lord corrects his
erroneous idea, saying that the properties of the flesh and the spirit are distinct. Let Eunomius
also, if he will, correct himself by the like reflection. For he who ponders on the truth
ought, I imagine, to contemplate his subject according to its own properties, not to slander
the immaterial by a charge against things material. For if a man, or a bull, or any other of
those things which are generated by the flesh, is not free from passion in generating or being

generated, what has this to do with that Nature which is without passion and without corruption?
The fact that we are mortal is no objection to the immortality of the Only-begotten,
nor does men’s propensity to vice render doubtful the immutability that is found in the
Divine Nature, nor is any other of our proper attributes transferred to God; but the peculiar
nature of the human and the Divine life is separated, and without common ground, and
their distinguishing properties stand entirely apart, so that those of the latter are not apprehended
in the former, nor, conversely, those of the former in the latter.</p>
<p>How comes it, therefore, that Eunomius, when the Divine generation is the subject for
discourse, leaves his subject, and discusses at length the things of earth, when on this matter
we have no dispute with him? Surely our craftsman’s aim is clear,—that by the slanderous
insinuation of passion he may raise an objection to the generation of the Lord. And here I
pass by the blasphemous nature of his view, and admire the man for his acuteness,—how
mindful he is of his own zealous endeavour, who, having by his previous statements established
the theory that the Son must be, and must be called, a “product of generation,” now
contends for the view that we ought not to entertain regarding Him the conception of generation.
For, if all generation, as this author imagines, has linked with it the condition of
passion, we are hereby absolutely compelled to admit that what is foreign to passion is alien
also from generation: for if these things, passion and generation, are considered as conjoined,
He that has no share in the one would not have any participation in the other. How then
does he call Him a “product” by reason of His generation, of Whom he tries to show by the
arguments he now uses, that He was not generated? and for what cause does he fight against
our master607, who counsels us in matters of Divine doctrine not to presume in namemaking,
but to confess that He is generated without transforming this conception into the
formula of a name, so as to call Him Who is generated “a product of generation,” as this
term is properly applied in Scripture to things inanimate, or to those which are mentioned
“as a figure of wickedness608”? When we speak of the propriety of avoiding the use of the
term “product,” he prepares for action that invincible rhetoric of his, and takes also to support
him his frigid grammatical phraseology, and by his skilful misuse of names, or equivocation,
or whatever one may properly call his processes—by these means, I say, he brings his syllogisms
to their conclusion, “not refusing to call Him Who is begotten by the name of ‘product
of generation.’” Then, as soon as we admit the term, and proceed to examine the conception
involved in the name, on the theory that thereby is vindicated the community of essence,
he again retracts his own words, and contends for the view that the “product of generation”

is not generated, raising an objection by his foul account of bodily generation, against the
pure and Divine and passionless generation of the Son, on the ground that it is not possible
that the two things, the true relationship to the Father, and exemption of His nature from
passion, should be found to coincide in God, but that, if there were no passion, there would
be no generation, and that, if one should acknowledge the true relationship, he would
thereby, in admitting generation, certainly admit passion also.</p>
<p>Not thus speaks the sublime John, not thus that voice of thunder which proclaims the
mystery of the Theology, who both names Him Son of God and purges his proclamation
from every idea of passion. For behold how in the very beginning of his Gospel he prepares
our ears, how great forethought is shown by the teacher that none of his hearers should fall
into low ideas on the subject, slipping by ignorance into any incongruous conceptions. For
in order to lead the untrained hearing as far away as possible from passion, he does not
speak in his opening words of “Son,” or “Father,” or “generation,” that no one should either,
on hearing first of all of a “Father,” be hurried on to the obvious signification of the word,
or, on learning the proclamation of a “Son,” should understand that name in the ordinary
sense, or stumble, as at a “stone of stumbling609,” at the word “generation”; but instead of
“the Father,” he speaks of “the Beginning”: instead of “was begotten,” he says “was”: and
instead of “the Son,” he says “the Word”: and declares “In the Beginning was the Word610.”
What passion, pray, is to be found in these words, “beginning,” and “was,” and “Word”? Is
“the beginning” passion? does “was” imply passion? does “the Word” exist by means of
passion? Or are we to say, that as passion is not to be found in the terms used, so neither is
affinity expressed by the proclamation? Yet how could the Word’s community of essence,
and real relationship, and coeternity with the Beginning, be more strongly shown by other
words than by these? For he does not say, “Of the Beginning was begotten the Word,” that
he may not separate the Word from the Beginning by any conception of extension in time,
but he proclaims together with the Beginning Him also Who was in the Beginning, making
the word “was” common to the Beginning and to the Word, that the Word may not linger
after the Beginning, but may, by entering in together with the faith as to the Beginning, by
its proclamation forestall our hearing, before this admits the Beginning itself in isolation.
Then he declares, “And the Word was with God.” Once more the Evangelist fears for our
untrained state, once more he dreads our childish and untaught condition: he does not yet
entrust to our ears the appellation of “Father,” lest any of the more carnally minded, learning
of “the Father,” may be led by his understanding to imagine also by consequence a mother.
Neither does he yet name in his proclamation the Son; for he still suspects our customary
tendency to the lower nature, and fears lest any, hearing of the Son, should humanize the
<note type="footnote">609 1 S. Pet. ii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">610 S. John i. 1</note>

<pb n="296"/>
Godhead by an idea of passion. For this reason, resuming his proclamation, he again calls
him “the Word,” making this the account of His nature to thee in thine unbelief. For as thy
word proceeds from thy mind, without requiring the intervention of passion, so here also,
in hearing of the Word, thou shalt conceive that which is from something, and shalt not
conceive passion. Hence, once more resuming his proclamation, he says, “And the Word
was with God.” O, how does he make the Word commensurate with God! rather, how does
he extend the infinite in comparison with the infinite! “The Word was with God”—the
whole being of the Word, assuredly, with the whole being of God. Therefore, as great as
God is, so great, clearly, is the Word also that is with Him; so that if God is limited, then
will the Word also, surely, be subject to limitation. But if the infinity of God exceeds limit,
neither is the Word that is contemplated with Him comprehended by limits and measures.
For no one would deny that the Word is contemplated together with the entire Godhead
of the Father, so that he should make one part of the Godhead appear to be in the Word,
and another destitute of the Word. Once more the spiritual voice of John speaks, once more
the Evangelist in his proclamation takes tender care for the hearing of those who are in
childhood: not yet have we so much grown by the hearing of his first words as to hear of
“the Son,” and yet remain firm without being moved from our footing by the influence of
the wonted sense. Therefore our herald, crying once more aloud, still proclaims in his third
utterance “the Word,” and not “the Son,” saying, “And the Word was God.” First he declared
wherein He was, then with whom He was, and now he says what He is, completing, by his
third repetition, the object of his proclamation. For he says, “It is no Word of those that are
readily understood, that I declare to you, but God under the designation of the Word.” For
this Word, that was in the Beginning, and was with God, was not anything else besides God,
but was also Himself God. And forthwith the herald, reaching the full height of his lofty
speech, declares that this God Whom his proclamation sets forth is He by Whom all things
were made, and is life, and the light of men, and the true light that shineth in darkness, yet
is not obscured by the darkness, sojourning with His own, yet not received by His own: and
being made flesh, and tabernacling, by means of the flesh, in man’s nature. And when he
has first gone through this number and variety of statements, he then names the Father and
the Only-begotten, when there can be no danger that what has been purified by so many
precautions should be allowed, in consequence of the sense of the word “Father,” to sink
down to any meaning tainted with pollution, for, “we beheld His glory,” he says, “the glory
as of the Only-begotten of the Father.”</p>
<p>Repeat, then, Eunomius, repeat this clever objection of yours to the Evangelist: “How
dost thou give the name of ‘Father’ in thy discourse, how that of Only-begotten, seeing that
all bodily generation is operated by passion?” Surely truth answers you on his behalf, that
the mystery of theology is one thing, and the physiology of unstable bodies is another. Wide
is the interval by which they are fenced off one from the other. Why do you join together

<pb n="297"/>
in your argument what cannot blend? how do you defile the purity of the Divine generation
by your foul discourse? how do you make systems for the incorporeal by the passions that
affect the body? Cease to draw your account of the nature of things above from those that
are below. I proclaim the Lord as the Son of God, because the gospel from heaven, given
through the bright cloud, thus proclaimed Him; for “This,” He saith, “is My beloved Son611.”
Yet, though I was taught that He is the Son, I was not dragged down by the name to the
earthly significance of “Son,” but I both know that He is from the Father and do not know
that He is from passion. And this, moreover, I will add to what has been said, that I know
even a bodily generation which is pure from passion, so that even on this point Eunomius’
physiology of bodily generation is proved false, if, that is to say, a bodily birth can be found
which does not admit passion. Tell me, was the Word made flesh, or not? You would not,
I presume, say that It was not. It was so made, then, and there is none who denies it. How
then was it that “God was manifested in the flesh612”? “By birth,” of course you will say. But
what sort of birth do you speak of? Surely it is clear that you speak of that from the virginity,
and that “that which was conceived in her was of the Holy Ghost613,” and that “the days
were accomplished that she should be delivered, and she brought forth614,” and none the
less was her purity preserved in her child-bearing. You believe, then, that that birth which
took place from a woman was pure from passion, if you do believe, but you refuse to admit
the Divine and incorruptible generation from the Father, that you may avoid the idea of
passion in generation. But I know well that it is not passion he seeks to avoid in his doctrine,
for that he does not discern at all in the Divine and incorruptible nature; but to the end that
the Maker of all creation may be accounted a part of creation, he builds up these arguments
in order to a denial of the Only-begotten God, and uses his pretended caution about passion
to help him in his task.</p>

<head>§2. He convicts Eunomius of having used of the Only-begotten terms applicable to the existence
of the earth, and thus shows that his intention is to prove the Son to be a being mutable
and created.</head>
<p>And this he shows very plainly by his contention against our arguments, where he says
that “the essence of the Son came into being from the Father, not put forth by way of extension,
not separated from its conjunction with Him that generated Him by flux or division,
not perfected by way of growth, not transformed by way of change, but obtaining existence
by the mere will of the Generator.” Why, what man whose mental senses are not closed up
is left in ignorance by this utterance that by these statements the Son is being represented
by Eunomius as a part of the creation? What hinders us from saying all this word for word
as it stands, about every single one of the things we contemplate in creation? Let us apply,
if you will, the definition to any of the things that appear in creation, and if it does not admit
the same sequence, we will condemn ourselves for having examined the definition slightingly,
and not with the care that befits the truth. Let us exchange, then, the name of the Son, and
so read the definition word by word. We say that the essence of the earth came into being
from the Father, not separated by way of extension or division from its conjunction with
Him Who generated it, nor perfected by way of growth, nor put forth by way of change, but
obtaining existence by the mere will of Him Who generated it. Is there anything in what we
have said that does not apply to the existence of the earth? I think no one would say so: for
God did not put forth the earth by being extended, nor bring its essence into existence by
flowing or by dissevering Himself from conjunction with Himself, nor did He bring it by
means of gradual growth from being small to completeness of magnitude, nor was He
fashioned into the form of earth by undergoing mutation or alteration, but His will sufficed
Him for the existence of all things that were made: “He spake and they were generated615,”
so that even the name of “generation” does not fail to accord with the existence of the earth.
Now if these things may be truly said of the parts of the universe, what doubt is still left as
to our adversaries’ doctrine, that while, so far as words go, they call Him “Son,” they represent
Him as being one of the things that came into existence by creation, set before the rest only
in precedence of order? just as you might say about the trade of a smith, that from it come
all things that are wrought out of iron; but that the instrument of the tongs and hammer,
by which the iron is fashioned for use, existed before the making of the rest; yet, while this
has precedence of the rest, there is not on that account any difference in respect of matter
between the instrument that fashions and the iron that is shaped by the instrument, (for
both one and the other are iron,) but the one form is earlier than the other. Such is the
theology of heresy touching the Son,—to imagine that there is no difference between the
Lord Himself and the things that were made by Him, save the difference in respect of order.</p>

<p>Who that is in any sense classed among Christians admits that the definition616 of the
essence of the parts of the world, and of Him Who made the world, is the same? For my
own part I shudder at the blasphemy, knowing that where the definition of things is the
same neither is their nature different. For as the definition of the essence of Peter and John
and other men is common and their nature is one, in the same way, if the Lord were in respect
of nature even as the parts of the world, they must acknowledge that He is also subject to
those things, whatever they may be, which they perceive in them. Now the world does not
last for ever: thus, according to them, the Lord also will pass away with the heaven and the
earth, if, as they say, He is of the same kind with the world. If on the other hand He is confessed
to be eternal, we must needs suppose that the world too is not without some part in
the Divine nature, if, as they say, it corresponds with the Only-begotten in the matter of
creation. You see where this fine process of inference makes the argument tend, like a stone
broken off from a mountain ridge and rushing down-hill by its own weight. For either the
elements of the world must be Divine, according to the foolish belief of the Greeks, or the
Son must not be worshipped. Let us consider it thus. We say that the creation, both what is
perceived by the mind, and that which is of a nature to be perceived by sense, came into
being from nothing: this they declare also of the Lord. We say that all things that have been
made consist by the will of God: this they tell us also of the Only-begotten. We believe that
neither the angelic creation nor the mundane is of the essence of Him that made it: and they
make Him also alien from the essence of the Father. We confess that all things serve Him
that made them: this view they also hold of the Only-begotten. Therefore, of necessity,
whatever else it may be that they conceive of the creation, all these attributes they will also
attach to the Only-begotten: and whatever they believe of Him, this they will also conceive
of the creation: so that, if they confess the Lord as God, they will also deify the rest of the
creation. On the other hand, if they define these things to be without share in the Divine
nature, they will not reject the same conception touching the Only-begotten also. Moreover
no sane man asserts Godhead of the creation. Then neither—I do not utter the rest, lest I
lend my tongue to the blasphemy of the enemy. Let those say what consequence follows,
whose mouth is well trained in blasphemy. But their doctrine is evident even if they hold
their peace. For one of two things must necessarily happen:—either they will depose the
Only-begotten God, so that with them He will no more either be, or be called so: or, if they
assert Godhead of Him, they will equally assert it of all creation:—or, (for this is still left to
them,) they will shun the impiety that appears on either side, and take refuge in the orthodox
doctrine, and will assuredly agree with us that He is not created, that they may confess Him
to be truly God.</p>

<p>What need is there to take time to recount all the other blasphemies that underlie his
doctrine, starting from this beginning? For by what we have quoted, one who considers the
inference to be drawn will understand that the father of falsehood, the maker of death, the
inventor of wickedness, being created in a nature intellectual and incorporeal, was not by
that nature hindered from becoming what he is by way of change. For the mutability of essence,
moved either way at will, involves a capacity of nature that follows the impulse of
determination, so as to become that to which its determination leads it. Accordingly they
will define the Lord as being capable even of contrary dispositions, drawing Him down as
it were to a rank equal with the angels, by the conception of creation617. But let them listen
to the great voice of Paul. Why is it that he says that He alone has been called Son? Because
He is not of the nature of angels, but of that which is more excellent. “For unto which of the
angels said He at any time, ‘Thou art My Son, This day have I begotten Thee’? and when
again He bringeth the first-begotten into the world He saith, ‘And let all the angels of God
worship Him.’ And of the angels He saith, ‘Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers
a flame of fire’: but of the Son He saith, ‘Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre
of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom618,’” and all else that the prophecy recites
together with these words in declaring His Godhead. And he adds also from another Psalm
the appropriate words, “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,
and the heavens are the works of Thine hands,” and the rest, as far as “But Thou art the
same, and Thy years shall not fail619,” whereby he describes the immutability and eternity
of His nature. If, then, the Godhead of the Only-begotten is as far above the angelic nature
as a master is superior to his slaves, how do they make common either with the sensible
creation Him Who is Lord of the creation, or with the nature of the angels Him Who is
worshipped by them620, by detailing, concerning the manner of His existence, statements
which will properly apply to the individual things we contemplate in creation, even as we
already showed the account given by heresy, touching the Lord, to be closely and appropriately
applicable to the making of the earth?</p>
<note type="footnote">617 The argument appears to be this:—The Anomoeans assert, on the ground that He is created, that the Son’s
essence is τρεπτὸν, liable to change; where there is the possibility of change, the nature must have a capacity of
inclining one way or the other, according to the balance of will determining to which side the nature shall incline:
and that this is the condition of the angels may be seen from the instance of the fallen angels, whose nature was
inclined to evil by their προαίρεσις. It follows that to say the Son is τρεπτὸς implies that He is on a level with
the angelic nature, and might fall even as the angels fell.</note>

<head>§3. He then again admirably discusses the term πρωτότοκος as it is four times employed by
the Apostle.</head>
<p>But that the readers of our work may find no ambiguity left of such a kind as to afford
any support to the heretical doctrines, it may be worth while to add to the passages examined
by us this point also from Holy Scripture. They will perhaps raise a question from the very
apostolic writings which we quoted: “How could He be called ‘the first-born of creation621’
if He were not what creation is? for every first-born is the first-born not of another kind,
but of its own: as Reuben, having precedence in respect of birth of those who are counted
after him, was the first-born, a man the first-born of men; and many others are called the
first-born of the brothers who are reckoned with them.” They say then, “We assert that He
Who is ‘the first-born of creation’ is of that same essence which we consider the essence of
all creation. Now if the whole creation is of one essence with the Father of all, we will not
deny that the first-born of creation is this also: but if the God of all differs in essence from
the creation, we must of necessity say that neither has the first-born of creation community
in essence with God.” The structure of this objection is not, I think, at all less imposing in
the form in which it is alleged by us, than in the form in which it would probably be brought
against us by our adversaries. But what we ought to know as regards this point shall now,
so far as we are able, be plainly set forth in our discourse.</p>
<p>Four times the name of “first-born” or “first-begotten” is used by the Apostle in all his
writings: but he has made mention of the name in different senses and not in the same
manner. For now he speaks of “the first-born of all creation622,” and again of “the first-born
among many brethren623,” then of “the first-born from the dead624;” and in the Epistle to
the Hebrews the name of “first-begotten” is absolute, being mentioned by itself: for he speaks
thus, “When again He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, ‘Let all the angels
worship Him625.’” As these passages are thus distinct, it may be well to interpret each of
them separately by itself, how He is the “first-born of creation,” how “among many brethren,”
how “from the dead,” and how, spoken of by Himself apart from each of these, when He is
again brought into the world, He is worshipped by all His angels. Let us begin then, if you
will, our survey of the passages before us with the last-mentioned.</p>
<note type="footnote">621 Cf. Col. i. 15 Πρωτότοκος may be, as it is in the Authorized Version, translated either by “first born,” or
by “first-begotten.” Compare with this passage Book II. §8, where the use of the word in Holy Scripture is discussed.</note>

<p>“When again He bringeth in,” he says, “the first-begotten into the world.” The addition
of “again” shows, by the force of this word, that this event happens not for the first time:
for we use this word of the repetition of things which have once happened. He signifies,
therefore, by the phrase, the dread appearing of the Judge at the end of the ages, when He
is seen no more in the form of a servant, but seated in glory upon the throne of His kingdom,
and worshipped by all the angels that are around Him. Therefore He Who once entered
into the world, becoming the first-born “from the dead,” and “of His brethren,” and “of all
creation,” does not, when He comes again into the world as He that judges the world in
righteousness626, as the prophecy saith, cast off the name of the first-begotten, which He
once received for our sakes; but as at the name of Jesus, which is above every name, every
knee bows627, so also the company of all the angels worships Him Who comes in the name
of the First-begotten, in their rejoicing over the restoration of men, wherewith, by becoming
the first-born among us, He restored us again to the grace which we had at the beginning628.
For since there is joy among the angels over those who are rescued from sin, (because until
now that creation groaneth and travaileth in pain at the vanity that affects us629, judging
our perdition to be their own loss,) when that manifestation of the sons of God takes place
which they look for and expect, and when the sheep is brought safe to the hundred above,
(and we surely—humanity that is to say—are that sheep which the Good Shepherd saved
by becoming the first-begotten630,) then especially will they offer, in their intense thanksgiving
on our behalf, their worship to God, Who by being first-begotten restored him that had
wandered from his Father’s home.</p>
<p>Now that we have arrived at the understanding of these words, no one could any longer
hesitate as to the other passages, for what reason He is the first-born, either “of the dead,”
or “of the creation,” or “among many brethren.” For all these passages refer to the same
point, although each of them sets forth some special conception. He is the first-born from
the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death631, that He might also make that
birth of the resurrection a way for all men632. Again, He becomes “the first-born among

many brethren,” Who is born before us by the new birth of regeneration in water, for the
travail whereof the hovering of the Dove was the midwife, whereby He makes those who
share with Him in the like birth to be His own brethren, and becomes the first-born of those
who after Him are born of water and of the Spirit633: and to speak briefly, as there are in us
three births, whereby human nature is quickened, one of the body, another in the sacrament
of regeneration, another by that resurrection of the dead for which we look, He is first-born
in all three:—of the twofold regeneration which is wrought by two (by baptism and by the
resurrection), by being Himself the leader in each of them; while in the flesh He is first-born,
as having first and alone devised in His own case that birth unknown to nature, which no
one in the many generations of men had originated. If these passages, then, have been rightly
understood, neither will the signification of the “creation,” of which He is first-born, be
unknown to us. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby
we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no
need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly,
when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that
there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should
no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, “Having
put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according
to God634,” and “If any man be in Christ,” he says, “he is a new creature: the old
things are passed away, behold all things are become new635:”) —for the maker of human
nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth
and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but
formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word
made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by
being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ,
which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of
those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, “that He might
be Lord both of the dead and of the living636,” and might sanctify the whole lump637 by
means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of “first-born” does not apply to
the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of “Only-begotten” testifies.
<note type="footnote">633 With this passage may be compared the parallel passage in Bk. II. §8. The interpretation of the “many

For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for how could any one be only-begotten
if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of
man,—for He has the form of God and the form of a servant638, being some things according
to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,—so too,
being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,—the Only-begotten,
He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among those who are saved by the new creation,
both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it,
He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does
not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say
this,—that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,—but they say,
that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Onlybegotten.
Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created,
they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all
things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the “first-born”
of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their “Father,” as the same relation
existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation.
For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the “First-born,” but the Father of the
Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same
reasoning, the “father,” and not properly the “first-born” of His own creatures, so that the
appellation of “first-born” will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in
the heretical conception.</p>

<head>§4. He proceeds again to discuss the impassibility of the Lord’s generation; and the folly of
Eunomius, who says that the generated essence involves the appellation of Son, and again,
forgetting this, denies the relation of the Son to the Father: and herein he speaks of Circe
and of the mandrake poison.</head>
<p>We must, however, return to those who connect passion with the Divine generation,
and on this account deny that the Lord is truly begotten, in order to avoid the conception
of passion. To say that passion is absolutely linked with generation, and that on this account,
in order that the Divine nature may continue in purity beyond the reach of passion, we
ought to consider that the Son is alien to the idea of generation, may perhaps appear reasonable
in the eyes of those who are easily deceived, but those who are instructed in the Divine
mysteries639 have an answer ready to hand, based upon admitted facts. For who knows not
that it is generation that leads us back to the true and blessed life, not being the same with
that which takes place “of blood and of the will of the flesh640,” in which are flux and change,
and gradual growth to perfection, and all else that we observe in our earthly generation: but
the other kind is believed to be from God, and heavenly, and, as the Gospel says, “from
above641,” which excludes the passions of flesh and blood? I presume that they both admit
the existence of this generation, and find no passion in it. Therefore not all generation is
naturally connected with passion, but the material generation is subject to passion, the immaterial
pure from passion. What constrains him then to attribute to the incorruptible
generation of the Son what properly belongs to the flesh, and, by ridiculing the lower form
of generation with his unseemly physiology, to exclude the Son from affinity with the
Father? For if, even in our own case, it is generation that is the beginning of either life,—that
generation which is through the flesh of a life of passion, that which is spiritual of a life of
purity, (and no one who is in any sense numbered among Christians would contradict this
statement,)—how is it allowable to entertain the idea of passion in thinking of generation
as it concerns the incorruptible Nature? Let us moreover examine this point in addition to
those we have mentioned. If they disbelieve the passionless character of the Divine generation
on the ground of the passion that affects the flesh, let them also, from the same tokens,
(those, I mean, to be found in ourselves,) refuse to believe that God acts as a Maker without
passion. For if they judge of the Godhead by comparison of our own conditions, they must
not confess that God either begets or creates; for neither of these operations is exercised by
ourselves without passion. Let them therefore either separate from the Divine nature both
creation and generation, that they may guard the impassibility of God on either side, and
let them, that the Father may be kept safely beyond the range of passion, neither growing

weary by creation, nor being defiled by generation, entirely reject from their doctrine the
belief in the Only-begotten, or, if they agree642 that the one activity is exercised by the Divine
power without passion, let them not quarrel about the other: for if He creates without labour
or matter, He surely also begets without labour or flux.</p>
<p>And here once more I have in this argument the support of Eunomius. I will state his
nonsense concisely and briefly, epitomizing his whole meaning. That men do not make
materials for us, but only by their art add form to matter,—this is the drift of what he says
in the course of a great quantity of nonsensical language. If, then, understanding conception
and formation to be included in the lower generation, he forbids on this ground the pure
notion of generation, by consequence, on the same reasoning, since earthly creation is busied
with the form, but cannot furnish matter together with the form, let him forbid us also, on
this ground, to suppose that the Father is a Creator. If, on the other hand, he refuses to
conceive creation in the case of God according to man’s measure of power, let him also
cease to slander Divine generation by human imperfections. But, that his accuracy and circumspection
in argument may be more clearly established, I will again return to a small
point in his statements. He asserts that “things which are respectively active and passive
share one another’s nature,” and mentions, after bodily generation, “the work of the craftsman
as displayed in materials.” Now let the acute hearer mark how he here fails in his proper
aim, and wanders about among whatever statements he happens to invent. He sees in things
that come into being by way of the flesh the “active and passive conceived, with the same
essence, the one imparting the essence, the other receiving it.” Thus he knows how to discern
the truth with accuracy as regards the nature of existing things, so as to separate the imparter
and the receiver from the essence, and to say that each of these is distinct in himself apart
from the essence. For he that receives or imparts is surely another besides that which is
given or received, so that we must first conceive some one by himself, viewed in his own
separate existence, and then speak of him as giving that which he has, or receiving that
which he has not643. And when he has sputtered out this argument in such a ridiculous
fashion, our sage friend does not perceive that by the next step he overthrows himself once
more. For he who by his art forms at his will the material before him, surely in this operation
acts; and the material, in receiving its form at the hand of him who exercises the art, is
passively affected: for it is not by remaining unaffected and unimpressionable that the material
receives its form. If then, even in the case of things wrought by art, nothing can come

<note type="footnote">643 It is not quite clear whether any of this passage, or, if so, how much of it, is a direct quotation from Eunomius.
Probably only the phrase about the imparting and receiving of the essence is taken from him, the rest of

which it is the essence, so that the thing can be viewed apart from its own essence.</note>

into being without passivity and action concurring to produce it, how can our author think
that he here abides by his own words? seeing that, in declaring community of essence to be
involved in the relation of action and passion, he seems not only to attest in some sense
community of essence in Him that is begotten with Him that begat Him, but also to make
the whole creation of one essence644 with its Maker, if, as he says, the active and the passive
are to be defined as mutually akin in respect of nature. Thus, by the very arguments by which
he establishes what he wishes, he overthrows the main object of his effort, and makes the
glory of the coessential Son more secure by his own contention. For if the fact of origination
from anything shows the essence of the generator to be in the generated, and if artificial
fabrication (being accomplished by means of action and passion) reduces both that which
makes and that which is produced to community of essence, according to his account, our
author in many places of his own writings maintains that the Lord has been begotten. Thus
by the very arguments whereby he seeks to prove the Lord alien from the essence of the
Father, he asserts for Him intimate connexion. For if, according to his account, separation
in essence is not observed either in generation or in fabrication, then, whatever he allows
the Lord to be, whether “created” or a “product of generation,” he asserts, by both names
alike, the affinity of essence, seeing that he makes community of nature in active and passive,
in generator and generated, a part of his system.</p>
<p>Let us turn however to the next point of the argument. I beg my readers not to be impatient
at the minuteness of examination which extends our argument to a length beyond
what we would desire. For it is not any ordinary matters on which we stand in danger, so
that our loss would be slight if we should hurry past any point that required more careful
attention, but it is the very sum of our hope that we have at stake. For the alternative before
us is, whether we should be Christians, not led astray by the destructive wiles of heresy, or
whether we should be completely swept away into the conceptions of Jews or heathen. To
the end, then, that we may not suffer either of these things forbidden, that we may neither
agree with the doctrine of the Jews by a denial of the verily begotten Son, nor be involved
in the downfall of the idolaters by the adoration of the creature, let us perforce spend some
time in the discussion of these matters, and set forth the very words of Eunomius, which
run thus:—</p>
<p>“Now as these things are thus divided, one might reasonably say that the most proper
and primary essence, and that which alone exists by the operation of the Father, admits for
itself the appellations of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product of making,’ and ‘product of creation’:”
and a little further on he says, “But the Son alone, existing by the operation of the
<note type="footnote">644 ὁμοούσιον</note>

<pb n="308"/>
Father, possesses His nature and His relation to Him that begat Him, without community645.”
Such are his words. But let us, like men who look on at their enemies engaged in a factious
struggle among themselves, consider first our adversaries’ contention against themselves,
and so proceed to set forth on the other side the true doctrine of godliness. “The Son alone,”
he says, “existing by the operation of the Father, possesses His nature and His relation to
Him that begat Him, without community.” But in his previous statements, he says that he
“does not refuse to call Him, that is begotten a ‘product of generation,’ as the generated essence
itself, and the appellation of Son, make such a relation of words appropriate.”</p>
<p>The contradiction existing in these passages being thus evident, I am inclined to admire
for their acuteness those who praise this doctrine. For it would be hard to say to which of
his statements they could turn without finding themselves at variance with the remainder.
His earlier statement represented that the generated essence, and the appellation of “Son,”
made such a relation of words appropriate. His present system says the contrary:—that “the
Son possesses His relation to Him that begat Him without community.” If they believe the
first statement, they will surely not accept the second: if they incline to the latter, they will
find themselves opposed to the earlier conception. Who will stay the combat? Who will
mediate in this civil war? Who will bring this discord into agreement, when the very soul
is divided against itself by the opposing statements, and drawn in different ways to contrary
doctrines? Perhaps we may see here that dark saying of prophecy which David speaks of
the Jews—“They were divided but were not pricked at heart646.” For lo, not even when they
are divided among contrariety of doctrines have they a sense of their discordancy, but they
are carried about by their ears like wine-jars, borne around at the will of him who shifts
them. It pleased him to say that the generated essence was closely connected with the appellation
of “Son”: straightway, like men asleep, they nodded assent to his remarks. He changed
his statement again to the contrary one, and denies the relation of the Son to Him that begat
Him: again his well-beloved friends join in assent to this also, shifting in whatever direction
he chooses, as the shadows of bodies change their form by spontaneous mimicry with the
motion of the advancing figure, and even if he contradicts himself, accepting that also. This
is another form of the drought that Homer tells us of, not changing the bodies of those who
drink its poison into the forms of brutes, but acting on their souls to produce in them a
change to a state void of reason. For of those men, the tale tells that their mind was sound,
while their form was changed to that of beasts, but here, while their bodies remain in their
<note type="footnote">645 This seems to be the force of ἀκοινώνητον: it is clear from what follows that it is to be understood as
denying community of essence between the Father and the Son, not as asserting only the unique character alike
of the Son and of His relation to the Father.</note>

natural state, their souls are transformed to the condition of brutes. And as there the poet’s
tale of wonder says that those who drank the drug were changed into the forms of various
beasts, at the pleasure of her who beguiled their nature, the same thing happens now also
from this Circe’s cup. For they who drink the deceit of sorcery from the same writing are
changed to different forms of doctrine, transformed now to one, now to another. And
meanwhile these very ridiculous people, according to the revised edition of the fable, are
still well pleased with him who leads them to such absurdity, and stoop to gather the words
he scatters about, as if they were cornel fruit or acorns, running greedily like swine to the
doctrines that are shed on the ground, not being naturally capable of fixing their gaze on
those which are lofty and heavenly. For this reason it is that they do not see the tendency
of his argument to contrary positions, but snatch without examination what comes in their
way: and as they say that the bodies of men stupefied with mandrake are held in a sort of
slumber and inability to move, so are the senses of these men’s souls affected, being made
torpid as regards the apprehension of deceit. It is certainly a terrible thing to be held in unconsciousness
by hidden guile, as the result of some fallacious argument: yet where it is involuntary
the misfortune is excusable: but to be brought to make trial of evil as the result
of a kind of forethought and zealous desire, not in ignorance of what will befall, surpasses
every extreme of misery. Surely we may well complain, when we hear that even greedy fish
avoid the steel when it comes near them unbaited, and take down the hook only when hope
of food decoys them to a bait: but where the evil is apparent, to go over of their own accord
to this destruction is a more wretched thing than the folly of the fish: for these are led by
their greediness to a destruction that is concealed from them, but the others swallow with
open mouth the hook of impiety in its bareness, satisfied with destruction under the influence
of some unreasoning passion. For what could be clearer than this contradiction—than to
say that the same Person was begotten and is a thing created, and that something is closely
connected with the name of “Son,” and, again, is alien from the sense of “Son”? But enough
of these matters.</p>

<head>§5. He again shows Eunomius, constrained by truth, in the character of an advocate of the
orthodox doctrine, confessing as most proper and primary, not only the essence of the
Father, but the essence also of the Only-begotten.</head>
<p>It might, however, be useful to look at the sense of the utterance of Eunomius that is
set before us in orderly sequence, recurring to the beginning of his statement. For the points
we have now examined were an obvious incitement to us to begin our reply with the last
passage, on account of the evident character of the contradiction involved in his words.
This, then, is what Eunomius says at the beginning:—</p>
<p>“Now, as these things are thus divided, one might reasonably say that the most proper
and primary essence, and that which alone exists by the operation of the Father, admits for
itself the appellations of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product of making,’ and ‘product of creation.’”
First, then, I would ask those who are attending to this discourse to bear in mind,
that in his first composition he says that the essence of the Father also is “most proper,” introducing
his statement with these words, “The whole account of our teaching is completed
with the supreme and most proper essence.” And here he calls the essence of the Only-begotten
“most proper and primary.” Thus putting together Eunomius’ phrases from each of
his books, we shall call him himself as a witness of the community of essence, who in another
place makes a declaration to this effect, that “of things which have the same appellations,
the nature also is not different” in any way. For our self-contradictory friend would not indicate
things differing in nature by identity of appellation, but it is surely for this reason,
that the definition of essence in Father and Son is one, that he says that the one is “most
proper,” and that the other also is “most proper.” And the general usage of men bears witness
to our argument, which does not apply the term “most proper” where the name does not
truly agree with the nature. For instance, we call a likeness, inexactly, “a man,” but what we
properly designate by this name is the animal presented to us in nature. And similarly, the
language of Scripture recognizes the appellation of “god” for an idol, and for a demon, and
for the belly: but here too the name has not its proper sense; and in the same way with all
other cases. A man is said to have eaten food in the fancy of a dream, but we cannot call this
fancy food, in the proper sense of the term. As, then, in the case of two men existing naturally,
we properly call both equally by the name of man, while if any one should join an inanimate
portrait in his enumeration with a real man, one might perhaps speak of him who really
exists and of the likeness, as “two men,” but would no longer attribute to both the proper
meaning of the word, so, on the supposition that the nature of the Only-begotten was conceived
as something else than the essence of the Father, our author would not have called
each of the essences “most proper.” For how could any one signify things differing in nature
by identity of names? Surely the truth seems to be made plain even by those who fight against
it, as falsehood is unable, even when expressed in the words of the enemy, utterly to prevail
over truth. Hence the doctrine of orthodoxy is proclaimed by the mouth of its opponents,

<pb n="311"/>
without their knowing what they say, as the saving Passion of the Lord for us had been
foretold in the case of Caiaphas, not knowing what he said647. If, therefore, true propriety
of essence is common to both (I mean to the Father and the Son), what room is there for
saying that their essences are mutually divergent? Or how is a difference by way of superior
power, or greatness, or honour, contemplated in them, seeing that the “most proper” essence
admits of no diminution? For that which is whatever it is imperfectly, is not that thing “most
properly,” be it nature, or power, or rank, or any other individual object of contemplation,
so that the superiority of the Father’s essence, as heresy will have it, proves the imperfection
of the essence of the Son. If then it is imperfect, it is not proper; but if it is “most proper” it
is also surely perfect. For it is not possible to call that which is deficient perfect. But neither
is it possible, when, in comparing them, that which is perfect is set beside that which is
perfect, to perceive any difference by way of excess or defect: for perfection is one in both
cases, as in a rule, not showing a hollow by defect, nor a projection by excess. Thus, from
these passages Eunomius’ advocacy in favour of our doctrine may be sufficiently seen—I
should rather say, not his earnestness on our behalf, but his conflict with himself. For he
turns against himself those devices whereby he establishes our doctrines by his own arguments.
Let us, however, once more follow his writings word for word, that it may be clear
to all that their argument has no power for evil except the desire to do mischief.</p>

<head>§6. He then exposes argument about the “Generate,” and the “product of making,” and “product
of creation,” and shows the impious nature of the language of Eunomius and Theognostus
on the “immediate” and “undivided” character of the essence, and its “relation to its creator
and maker.”</head>
<p>Let us listen, then, to what he says. “One might reasonably say that the most proper and
primary essence, and that which alone exists by the operation of the Father, admits for itself
the appellations of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product of making,’ and ‘product of creation.’”
Who knows not that what separates the Church from heresy is this term, “product of creation,”
applied to the Son? Accordingly, the doctrinal difference being universally acknowledged,
what would be the reasonable course for a man to take who endeavours to show
that his opinions are more true than ours? Clearly, to establish his own statement, by
showing, by such proofs as he could, that we ought to consider that the Lord is created. Or
omitting this, should he rather lay down a law for his readers that they should speak of
matters of controversy as if they were acknowledged facts? For my own part, I think he
should take the former course, and perhaps all who possess any share of intelligence demand
this of their opponents, that they should, to begin with, establish upon some incontrovertible
basis the first principle of their argument, and so proceed to press their theory by inferences.
Now our writer leaves alone the task of establishing the view that we should think He is
created, and goes on to the next steps, fitting on the inferential process of his argument to
this unproved assumption, being just in the condition of those men whose minds are deep
in foolish desires, with their thoughts wandering upon a kingdom, or upon some other object
of pursuit. They do not think how any of the things on which they set their hearts could
possibly be, but they arrange and order their good fortune for themselves at their pleasure,
as if it were theirs already, straying with a kind of pleasure among non-existent things. So,
too, our clever author somehow or other lulls his own renowned dialectic to sleep, and before
giving a demonstration of the point at issue, he tells, as if to children, the tale of this deceitful
and inconsequent folly of his own doctrine, setting it forth like a story told at a drinkingparty.
For he says that the essence which “exists by the operation of the Father” admits the
appellation of “product of generation,” and of “product of making,” and of “product of
creation.” What reasoning showed us that the Son exists by any constructive operation, and
that the nature of the Father remains inoperative with regard to the Personal existence648
of the Son? This was the very point at issue in the controversy, whether the essence of the
Father begat the Son, or whether it made Him as one of the external things which accompany
His nature649. Now seeing that the Church, according to the Divine teaching, believes the
<note type="footnote">648 ὑπόστασιν</note>
<note type="footnote">649 At a later stage Gregory points out that the idea of creation is involved, if the thing produced is external
to the nature of the Maker.</note>

<pb n="313"/>
Only-begotten to be verily God, and abhors the superstition of polytheism, and for this
cause does not admit the difference of essences, in order that the Godheads may not, by divergence
of essence, fall under the conception of number (for this is nothing else than to
introduce polytheism into our life)—seeing, I say, that the Church teaches this in plain
language, that the Only-begotten is essentially God, very God of the essence of the very God,
how ought one who opposes her decisions to overthrow the preconceived opinion? Should
he not do so by establishing the opposing statement, demonstrating the disputed point from
some acknowledged principle? I think no sensible man would look for anything else than
this. But our author starts from the disputed points, and takes, as though it were admitted,
matter which is in controversy as a principle for the succeeding argument. If it had first
been shown that the Son had His existence through some operation, what quarrel should
we have with what follows, that he should say that the essence which exists through an operation
admits for itself the name of “product of making”? But let the advocates of error tell
us how the consequence has any force, so long as the antecedent remains unestablished.
For supposing one were to grant by way of hypothesis that man is winged, there will be no
question of concession about what comes next: for he who becomes winged will fly in some
way or other, and lift himself up on high above the earth, soaring through the air on his
wings. But we have to see how he whose nature is not aerial could become winged, and if
this condition does not exist, it is vain to discuss the next point. Let our author, then, show
this to begin with, that it is in vain that the Church has believed that the Only-begotten Son
truly exists, not adopted by a Father falsely so called, but existing according to nature, by
generation from Him Who is, not alienated from the essence of Him that begat Him. But
so long as his primary proposition remains unproved, it is idle to dwell on those which are
secondary. And let no one interrupt me, by saying that what we confess should also be
confirmed by constructive reasoning: for it is enough for proof of our statement, that the
tradition has come down to us from our fathers, handed on, like some inheritance, by succession
from the apostles and the saints who came after them. They, on the other hand, who
change their doctrines to this novelty, would need the support of arguments in abundance,
if they were about to bring over to their views, not men light as dust, and unstable, but men
of weight and steadiness: but so long as their statement is advanced without being established,
and without being proved, who is so foolish and so brutish as to account the teaching of the
evangelists and apostles, and of those who have successively shone like lights in the churches,
of less force than this undemonstrated nonsense?</p>
<p>Let us further look at the most remarkable instance of our author’s cleverness; how, by
the abundance of his dialectic skill, he ingeniously draws over to the contrary view the more
simple sort. He throws in, as an addition to the title of “product of making,” and that of
“product of creation,” the further phrase, “product of generation,” saying that the essence

<pb n="314"/>
of the Son “admits these names for itself”; and thinks that, so long as he harangues as if he
were in some gathering of topers, his knavery in dealing with doctrine will not be detected
by any one. For in joining “product of generation” with “product of making,” and “product
of creation,” he thinks that he stealthily makes away with the difference in significance
between the names, by putting together what have nothing in common. These are his clever
tricks of dialectic; but we mere laymen in argument650 do not deny that, so far as voice and
tongue are concerned, we are what his speech sets forth about us, but we allow also that our
ears, as the prophet says, are made ready for intelligent hearing. Accordingly, we are not
moved, by the conjunction of names that have nothing in common, to make a confusion
between the things they signify: but even if the great Apostle names together wood, hay,
stubble, gold, silver, and precious stones651, we reckon up summarily the number of things
he mentions, and yet do not fail to recognize separately the nature of each of the substances
named. So here, too, when “product of generation” and “product of making” are named
together, we pass from the sounds to the sense, and do not behold the same meaning in
each of the names; for “product of creation” means one thing, and “product of generation”
another: so that even if he tries to mingle what will not blend, the intelligent hearer will
listen with discrimination, and will point out that it is an impossibility for any one nature
to “admit for itself” the appellation of “product of generation,” and that of “product of creation.”
For, if one of these were true, the other would necessarily be false, so that, if the thing
were a product of creation, it would not be a product of generation, and conversely, if it
were called a product of generation, it would be alienated from the title of “product of creation.”
Yet Eunomius tells us that the essence of the Son “admits for itself the appellations
of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product of making,’ and ‘product of creation’”!</p>
<p>Does he, by what still remains, make at all more secure this headless and rootless statement
of his, in which, in its earliest stage, nothing was laid down that had any force with
regard to the point he is trying to establish? or does the rest also cling to the same folly, not
deriving its strength from any support it gets from argument, but setting out its exposition
of blasphemy with vague details like the recital of dreams? He says (and this he subjoins to
what I have already quoted)—“Having its generation without intervention, and preserving
indivisible its relation to its Generator, Maker, and Creator.” Well, if we were to leave alone
the absence of intervention and of division, and look at the meaning of the words as it stands
by itself, we shall find that everywhere his absurd teaching is cast upon the ears of those
whom he deceives, without corroboration from a single argument. “Its Generator, and
<note type="footnote">650 This phrase seems to be quoted from Eunomius. The reference to the “prophet” may possibly be suggested
by Is. vi. 9–10: but it is more probably only concerned with the words ὠτία and ἀκοὴν, as applied to convey the
idea of mental alertness.</note>
<note type="footnote">651 Cf. 1 Cor. iii. 12.</note>

<pb n="315"/>
Maker, and Creator,” he says. These names, though they seem to be three, include the sense
of but two concepts, since two of the words are equivalent in meaning. For to make is the
same as to create, but generation is another thing distinct from those spoken of. Now, seeing
that the result of the signification of the words is to divide the ordinary apprehension of
men into different ideas, what argument demonstrates to us that making is the same thing
with generation, to the end that we may accommodate the one essence to this difference of
terms? For so long as the ordinary significance of the words holds, and no argument is found
to transfer the sense of the terms to an opposite meaning, it is not possible that any one
nature should be divided between the conception of “product of making,” and that of
“product of generation.” Since each of these terms, used by itself, has a meaning of its own,
we must also suppose the relative conjunction in which they stand to be appropriate and
germane to the terms. For all other relative terms have their connection, not with what is
foreign and heterogeneous, but, even if the correlative term be suppressed, we hear spontaneously,
together with the primary word, that which is linked with it, as in the case of “maker,”
“slave,” “friend,” “son,” and so forth. For all names that are considered as relative to another,
present to us, by the mention of them, each its proper and closely connected relationship
with that which it declares, while they avoid all mixture of that which is heterogeneous652.
For neither is the name of “maker” linked with the word “son,” nor the term “slave” referred
to the term “maker,” nor does “friend” present to us a “slave,” nor “son” a “master,” but we
recognize clearly and distinctly the connection of each of these with its correlative, conceiving
by the word “friend” another friend; by “slave,” a master; by “maker,” work; by “son,” a
father. In the same way, then, “product of generation” has its proper relative sense; with the
“product of generation,” surely, is linked the generator, and with the “product of creation”
the creator; and we must certainly, if we are not prepared by a substitution of names to introduce
a confusion of things, preserve for each of the relative terms that which it properly
connotes.</p>
<p>Now, seeing that the tendency of the meaning of these words is manifest, how comes
it that one who advances his doctrine by the aid of logical system failed to perceive in these
names their proper relative sense? But he thinks that he is linking on the “product of generation”
to “maker,” and the “product of making” to “generator,” by saying that the essence
of the Son “admits for itself the appellations of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product of making,’
and ‘product of creation,’” and “preserves indivisible its relation to its Generator, Maker,
and Creator.” For it is contrary to nature, that a single thing should be split up into different
<note type="footnote">652 E.g.“A thing made” suggests to us the thought of a “maker,” “a maker” the thought of the thing made;
and they suggest also a close connection as existing between the two correlative terms of one of which the name
is uttered; but neither suggests in the same way any term which is not correlative, or with which it is not, in
some manner, in pari materia.</note>

<pb n="316"/>
relations. But the Son is properly related to the Father, and that which is begotten to him
that begat it, while the “product of making” has its relation to its “maker”; save if one might
consider some inexact use, in some undistinguishing way of common parlance, to overrule
the strict signification.</p>
<p>By what reasoning then is it, and by what arguments, according to that invincible logic
of his, that he wins back the opinion of the mass of men, and follows out at his pleasure this
line of thought, that as the God Who is over all is conceived and spoken of both as “Creator”
and as “Father,” the Son has a close connection with both titles, being equally called both
“product of creation” and “product of generation”? For as customary accuracy of speech
distinguishes between names of this kind, and applies the name of “generation” in the case
of things generated from the essence itself, and understands that of “creation” of those things
which are external to the nature of their maker, and as on this account the Divine doctrines,
in handing down the knowledge of God, have delivered to us the names of “Father” and
“Son,” not those of “Creator” and “work,” that there might arise no error tending to blasphemy
(as might happen if an appellation of the latter kind repelled the Son to the position
of an alien and a stranger), and that the impious doctrines which sever the Only-begotten
from essential affinity with the Father might find no entrance—seeing all this, I say, he who
declares that the appellation of “product of making” is one befitting the Son, will safely say
by consequence that the name of “Son” is properly applicable to that which is the product
of making; so that, if the Son is a “product of making,” the heaven is called “Son,” and the
individual things that have been made are, according to our author, properly named by the
appellation of “Son.” For if He has this name, not because He shares in nature with Him
that begat Him, but is called Son for this reason, that He is created, the same argument will
permit that a lamb, a dog, a frog, and all things that exist by the will of their maker, should
be named by the title of “Son.” If, on the other hand, each of these is not a Son and is not
called God, by reason of its being external to the nature of the Son, it follows, surely, that
He Who is truly Son is Son, and is confessed to be God by reason of His being of the very
nature of Him that begat Him. But Eunomius abhors the idea of generation, and excludes
it from the Divine doctrine, slandering the term by his fleshly speculations. Well, our discourse,
in what precedes, showed sufficiently on this point that, as the Psalmist says, “they
are afraid where no fear is653.” For if it was shown in the case of men that not all generation
exists by way of passion, but that that which is material is by passion, while that which is
spiritual is pure and incorruptible, (for that which is begotten of the Spirit is spirit and not
flesh, and in spirit we see no condition that is subject to passion,) since our author thought
it necessary to estimate the Divine power by means of examples among ourselves, let him
persuade himself to conceive from the other mode of generation the passionless character
<note type="footnote">653 Cf. Ps. liii. 6</note>

<pb n="317"/>
of the Divine generation. Moreover, by mixing up together these three names, of which two
are equivalent, he thinks that his readers, by reason of the community of sense in the two
phrases, will jump to the conclusion that the third is equivalent also. For since the appellation
of “product of making,” and “product of creation,” indicate that the thing made is external
to the nature of the maker, he couples with these the phrase, “product of generation,” that
this too may be interpreted along with those above mentioned. But argument of this sort is
termed fraud and falsehood and imposition, not a thoughtful and skilful demonstration.
For that only is called demonstration which shows what is unknown from what is acknowledged;
but to reason fraudulently and fallaciously, to conceal your own reproach, and to
confound by superficial deceits the understanding of men, as the Apostle says, “of corrupt
minds654,” this no sane man would call a skilful demonstration.</p>
<p>Let us proceed, however, to what follows in order. He says that the generation of the
essence is “without intervention,” and that it “preserves indivisible its relation to its Generator,
Maker, and Creator.” Well, if he had spoken of the immediate and indivisible character
of the essence, and stopped his discourse there, it would not have swerved from the orthodox
view, since we too confess the close connection and relation of the Son with the Father, so
that there is nothing inserted between them which is found to intervene in the connection
of the Son with the Father, no conception of interval, not even that minute and indivisible
one, which, when time is divided into past, present, and future, is conceived indivisibly by
itself as the present, as it cannot be considered as a part either of the past or of the future,
by reason of its being quite without dimensions and incapable of division, and unobservable,
to whichever side it might be added. That, then, which is perfectly immediate, admits we
say, of no such intervention; for that which is separated by any interval would cease to be
immediate. If, therefore, our author, likewise, in saying that the generation of the Son is
“without intervention,” excluded all these ideas, then he laid down the orthodox doctrine
of the conjunction of Him Who is with the Father. When, however, as though in a fit of repentance,
he straightway proceeded to add to what he had said that the essence “preserves
its relation to its Generator, Maker, and Creator,” he polluted his first statement by his
second, vomiting forth his blasphemous utterance upon the pure doctrine. For it is clear
that there too his “without intervention” has no orthodox intention, but, as one might say
that the hammer is mediate between the smith and the nail, but its own making is “without
intervention,” because, when tools had not yet been found out by the craft, the hammer
came first from the craftsman’s hands by some inventive process, not655 by means of any
<note type="footnote">654 2 Tim. iii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">655 It seems necessary for the sense to read οὐ δι᾽ ἑτέρου τινὸς ὀργάνου, since the force of the comparison
consists in the hammer being produced immediately by the smith: otherwise we must understand δι᾽ ἑτέρου

even so the parallel would be destroyed.</note>

other tool, and so by it the others were made; so the phrase, “without intervention,” indicates
that this is also our author’s conception touching the Only-begotten. And here Eunomius
is not alone in his error as regards the enormity of his doctrine, but you may find a parallel
also in the works of Theognostus656, who says that God, wishing to make this universe, first
brought the Son into existence as a sort of standard of the creation; not perceiving that in
his statement there is involved this absurdity, that what exists, not for its own sake, but for
the sake of something else, is surely of less value than that for the sake of which it exists: as
we provide an implement of husbandry for the sake of life, yet the plough is surely not
reckoned as equally valuable with life. So, if the Lord also exists on account of the world,
and not all things on account of Him, the whole of the things for the sake of which they say
He exists, would be more valuable than the Lord. And this is what they are here establishing
by their argument, where they insist that the Son has His relation to His Creator and Maker
“without intervention.”</p>
<note type="footnote">656 Theognostus, a writer of the third century, is said to have been the head of the Catechetical School at Alexandria,
and is quoted by S. Athanasius as an authority against the Arians. An account of his work is to be
found in Photius, and this is extracted and printed with the few remaining fragments of his actual writings in

<head>§7. He then clearly and skilfully criticises the doctrine of the impossibility of comparison with
the things made after the Son, and exposes the idolatry contrived by Eunomius, and concealed
by the terminology of “Son” and “Only-begotten,” to deceive his readers.</head>
<p>In the remainder of the passage, however, he becomes conciliatory, and says that the
essence “is not compared with any of the things that were made by it and after it657.” Such
are the gifts which the enemies of the truth offer to the Lord658, by which their blasphemy
is made more manifest. Tell me what else is there of all things in creation that admits of
comparison with a different thing, seeing that the characteristic nature that appears in each
absolutely rejects community with things of a different kind659? The heaven admits no
comparison with the earth, nor this with the stars, nor the stars with the seas, nor water
with stone, nor animals with trees, nor land animals with winged creatures, nor four-footed
beasts with those that swim, nor irrational with rational creatures. Indeed, why should one
take up time with individual instances, in showing that we may say of every single thing
that we behold in the creation, precisely what was thrown to the Only-begotten, as if it were
something special—that He admits of comparison with none of the things that have been
produced after Him and by Him? For it is clear that everything which you conceive by itself
is incapable of comparison with the universe, and with the individual things which compose
it; and it is this, which may be truly said of any creature you please, which is allotted by the
enemies of the truth, as adequate and sufficient for His honour and glory, to the Only-begotten
God! And once more, putting together phrases of the same sort in the remainder of
the passage, he dignifies Him with his empty honours, calling Him “Lord” and “Only-begot-
ten”: but that no orthodox meaning may be conveyed to his readers by these names, he
promptly mixes up blasphemy with the more notable of them. His phrase runs
thus:—“Inasmuch,” he says, “as the generated essence leaves no room for community to
anything else (for it is only-begotten660), nor is the operation of the Maker contemplated
as common.” O marvellous insolence! as though he were addressing his harangue to brutes,
or senseless beings “which have no understanding661,” he twists his argument about in
<note type="footnote">657 Oehler’s proposal to read “vel invitis libris quod sententia flagitat τῶν δἰ ἀυτοῦ καὶ μετ᾽ αῦτὸν” does not

contrary ways, as he pleases; or rather he suffers as men do who are deprived of sight; for
they too behave often in unseemly ways before the eyes of those who see, supposing, because
they themselves cannot see, that they are also unseen. For what sort of man is it who does
not see the contradiction in his words? Because it is “generated,” he says, the essence leaves
other things no room for community, for it is only-begotten; and then when he has uttered
these words, really as though he did not see or did not suppose himself to be seen, he tacks
on, as if corresponding to what he has said, things that have nothing in common with them,
coupling “the operation of the maker” with the essence of the Only-begotten. That which
is generated is correlative to the generator, and the Only-begotten, surely, by consequence,
to the Father; and he who looks to the truth beholds, in co-ordination with the Son, not “the
operation of the maker,” but the nature of Him that begat Him. But he, as if he were talking
about plants or seeds, or some other thing in the order of creation, sets “the operation of
the maker” by the side of the existence662 of the Only-begotten. Why, if a stone or a stick,
or something of that sort, were the subject of consideration, it would be logical to pre-suppose
“the operation of the maker”; but if the Only-begotten God is confessed, even by His adversaries,
to be a Son, and to exist by way of generation, how do the same words befit Him
that befit the lowest portions of the creation? how do they think it pious to say concerning
the Lord the very thing which may be truly said of an ant or a gnat? For if any one understood
the nature of an ant, and its peculiar ties in reference to other living things, he would not
be beyond the truth in saying that “the operation of its maker is not contemplated as common”
with reference to the other things. What, therefore, is affirmed of such things as these,
this they predicate also of the Only-begotten, and as hunters are said to intercept the passage
of their game with holes, and to conceal their design by covering over the mouths of the
holes with some unsound and unsubstantial material, in order that the pit may seem level
with the ground about it, so heresy contrives against men something of the same sort, covering
over the hole of their impiety with these fine-sounding and pious names, as it were
with a level thatch, so that those who are rather unintelligent, thinking that these men’s
preaching is the same with the true faith, because of the agreement of their words, hasten
towards the mere name of the Son and the Only-begotten, and step into emptiness in the
hole, since the significance of these titles will not sustain the weight of their tread, but lets
them down into the pitfall of the denial of Christ. This is why he speaks of the generated
essence that leaves nothing room for community, and calls it “Only-begotten.” These are
the coverings of the hole. But when any one stops before he is caught in the gulf, and puts
forth the test of argument, like a hand, upon his discourse, he sees the dangerous downfall
of idolatry lying beneath the doctrine. For when he draws near, as though to God and the
Son of God, he finds a creature of God set forth for his worship. This is why they proclaim
<note type="footnote">662 ὑποστάσε.</note>

<pb n="321"/>
high and low the name of the Only-begotten, that the destruction may be readily accepted
by the victims of their deceit, as though one were to mix up poison in bread, and give a
deadly greeting to those who asked for food, who would not have been willing to take the
poison by itself, had they not been enticed to what they saw. Thus he has a sharp eye to the
object of his efforts, at least so far as his own opinion goes. For if he had entirely rejected
from his teaching the name of the Son, his falsehood would not have been acceptable to
men, when his denial was openly stated in a definite proclamation; but now leaving only
the name, and changing the signification of it to express creation, he at once sets up his idolatry,
and fraudulently hides its reproach. But since we are bidden not to honour God with
our lips663, and piety is not tested by the sound of a word, but the Son must first be the object
of belief in the heart unto righteousness, and then be confessed with the mouth unto salvation664,
and those who say in their hearts that He is not God, even though with their mouths
they confess Him as Lord, are corrupt and became abominable665, as the prophet says,—for
this cause, I say, we must look to the mind of those who put forward, forsooth, the words
of the faith, and not be enticed to follow their sound. If, then, one who speaks of the Son
does not by that word refer to a creature, he is on our side and not on the enemy’s; but if
any one applies the name of Son to the creation, he is to be ranked among idolaters. For
they too gave the name of God to Dagon and Bel and the Dragon, but they did not on that
account worship God. For the wood and the brass and the monster were not God.</p>

<head>§8. He proceeds to show that there is no “variance” in the essence of the Father and the Son:
wherein he expounds many forms of variation and harmony, and explains the “form,”
the “seal,” and the “express image.”</head>
<p>But what need is there in our discourse to reveal his hidden deceit by mere guesses at
his intention, and possibly to give our hearers occasions for objection, on the ground that
we make these charges against our enemies untruly? For lo, he sets forth to us his blasphemy
in its nakedness, not hiding his guile by any veil, but speaking boldly in his absurdities with
unrestrained voice. What he has written runs thus:—“We, for our part,” he says, “as we find
nothing else besides the essence of the Son which admits of the generation, are of opinion
that we must assign the appellations to the essence itself, or else we speak of ‘Son’ and ‘begotten’
to no purpose, and as a mere verbal matter, if we are really to separate them from
the essence; starting from these names, we also confidently maintain that the essences are
variant from each other666.”</p>
<p>There is no need, I imagine, that the absurdity here laid down should be refuted by arguments
from us. The mere reading of what he has written is enough to pillory his blasphemy.
But let us thus examine it. He says that the essences of the Father and the Son are “variant.”
What is meant by “variant”? Let us first of all examine the force of the term as it is applied
by itself667, that by the interpretation of the word its blasphemous character may be more
clearly revealed. The term “variance” is used, in the inexact sense sanctioned by custom, of
bodies, when, by palsy or any other disease, any limb is perverted from its natural co-ordination.
For we speak, comparing the state of suffering with that of health, of the condition
of one who has been subjected to a change for the worse, as being a “variation” from his
usual health; and in the case of those who differ in respect of virtue and vice, comparing the
licentious life with that of purity and temperance, or the unjust life with that of justice, or
the life which is passionate, warlike, and prodigal of anger, with that which is mild and
<note type="footnote">666 The whole passage is rather obscure, and Oehler’s punctuation renders it perhaps more obscure than that
which is here adopted. The argument seems to be something like this:—“The generated essence is not compared
with any of the things made by it, or after it, because being only-begotten it leaves no room for a common basis
of comparison with anything else, and the operation of its maker is also peculiar to itself (since it is immediate,
the operation in the case of other things being mediate). The essence of the Son, then, being so far isolated, it is
to it that the appellations of γέννημα, ποίημα, and κτίσμα are to be assigned; otherwise the terms ‘Son’ and
‘Only-begotten’ are meaningless. Therefore the Son, being in essence a ποίημα or κτίσμα, is alien from the
Father Who made or created Him.” The word παρηλλάχθαι, used to express the difference of essence between
the Father and the Son, is one for which it is hard to find an equivalent which shall suit all the cases of the use
of the word afterwards instanced: the idea of “variation,” however, seems to attach to all these cases, and the
verb has been translated accordingly.</note>

peaceful—and generally all that is reproached with vice, as compared with what is more
excellent, is said to exhibit “variance” from it, because the marks observed in both—in the
good, I mean, and the inferior—do not mutually agree. Again, we say that those qualities
observed in the elements are “at variance” which are mutually opposed as contraries, having
a power reciprocally destructive, as heat and cold, or dryness and moisture, or, generally,
anything that is opposed to another as a contrary; and the absence of union in these we express
by the term “variation”; and generally everything which is out of harmony with another
in their observed characteristics, is said to be “at variance” with it, as health with disease,
life with death, war with peace, virtue with vice, and all similar cases.</p>
<p>Now that we have thus analyzed these expressions, let us also consider in regard to our
author in what sense he says that the essences of the Father and the Son are “variant from
each other.” What does he mean by it? Is it in the sense that the Father is according to nature,
while the Son “varies” from that nature? Or does he express by this word the perversion of
virtue, separating the evil from the more excellent by the name of “variation,” so as to regard
the one essence in a good, the other in a contrary aspect? Or does he assert that one Divine
essence also is variant from another, in the manner of the opposition of the elements? or as
war stands to peace, and life to death, does he also perceive in the essences the conflict which
so exists among all such things, so that they cannot unite one with another, because the
mixture of contraries exerts upon the things mingled a consuming force, as the wisdom of
the Proverbs saith of such a doctrine, that water and fire never say “It is enough668,” expressing
enigmatically the nature of contraries of equal force and equal balance, and their mutual
destruction? Or is it in none of these ways that he sees “variance” in the essences? Let him
tell us, then, what he conceives besides these. He could not say, I take it, even if he were to
repeat his wonted phrase669, “The Son is variant from Him Who begat Him”; for thereby
the absurdity of his statements is yet more clearly shown. For what mutual relation is so
closely and concordantly engrafted and fitted together as that meaning of relation to the
Father expressed by the word “Son”? And a proof of this is that even if both of these names
be not spoken, that which is omitted is connoted by the one that is uttered, so closely is the
one implied in the other, and concordant with it: and both of them are so discerned in the
<note type="footnote">668 Cf. Prov. xxx. 15 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">669 The sense given would perhaps be clearer if we were to read (as Gulonius seems to have done) ἀσυνήθη
for συνήθη. This might be interpreted, “He could not say, I take it, even if he uses the words in an unwonted
sense, that the Son is at variance with Him Who begat Him.” The συνήθη would thus be the senses already
considered and set aside: and the point would be that such a statement could not be made without manifest
absurdity, even if some out-of-the-way sense were attached to the words. As the passage stands, it must mean
that even if Eunomius repeats his wonted phrase, that can suggest no other sense of “variance” than those enumerated.</note>

one that one cannot be conceived without the other. Now that which is “at variance” is
surely so conceived and so called, in opposition to that which is “in harmony,” as the plumbline
is in harmony with the straight line, while that which is crooked, when set beside that
which is straight, does not harmonize with it. Musicians also are wont to call the agreement
of notes “harmony,” and that which is out of tune and discordant “inharmonious.” To speak
of things as at “variance,” then, is the same as to speak of them as “out of harmony.” If,
therefore, the nature of the Only-begotten God is at “variance,” to use the heretical phrase,
with the essence of the Father, it is surely not in harmony with it: and inharmoniousness
cannot exist where there is no possibility of harmony670. For the case is as when, the figure
in the wax and in the graying of the signet being one, the wax that has been stamped by the
signet, when it is fitted again to the latter, makes the impression on itself accord with that
which surrounds it, filling up the hollows and accommodating the projections of the engraving
with its own patterns: but if some strange and different pattern is fitted to the engraving
of the signet, it makes its own form rough and confused, by rubbing off its figure on an engraved
surface that does not correspond with it. But He Who is “in the form of God671” has
been formed by no impression different from the Father, seeing that He is “the express image”
of the Father’s Person672, while the “form of God” is surely the same thing as His essence.
For as, “being made in the form of a servant673,” He was formed in the essence of a servant,
not taking upon Him the form merely, apart from the essence, but the essence is involved
in the sense of “form,” so, surely, he who says that He is “in the form of God” signified essence
by “form.” If, therefore, He is “in the form of God,” and being in the Father is sealed with
the Father’s glory, (as the word of the Gospel declares, which saith, “Him hath God the
Father sealed674,”—whence also “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father675,”) then “the
image of goodness” and “the brightness of glory,” and all other similar titles, testify that the
essence of the Son is not out of harmony with the Father. Thus by the text cited is shown
the insubstantial character of the adversaries’ blasphemy. For if things at “variance” are not
in harmony, and He Who is sealed by the Father, and displays the Father in Himself, both
being in the Father, and having the Father in Himself676, shows in all points His close relation
and harmony, then the absurdity of the opposing views is hereby overwhelmingly shown.

For as that which is at “variance” was shown to be out of harmony, so conversely that which
is harmonious is surely confessed beyond dispute not to be at “variance.” For as that which
is at “variance” is not harmonious, so the harmonious is not at “variance.” Moreover, he
who says that the nature of the Only-begotten is at “variance” with the good essence of the
Father, clearly has in view variation in the good itself. But as for what that is which is at
variance with the good—“O ye simple,” as the Proverb saith, “understand his craftiness677!”</p>

<head>§9. Then, distinguishing between essence and generation, he declares the empty and frivolous
language of Eunomius to be like a rattle. He proceeds to show that the language used by
the great Basil on the subject of the generation of the Only-begotten has been grievously
slandered by Eunomius, and so ends the book.</head>
<p>I will pass by these matters, however, as the absurdity involved is evident; let us examine
what precedes. He says that nothing else is found, “besides the essence of the Son, which
admits of the generation.” What does he mean when he says this? He distinguishes two
names from each other, and separating by his discourse the things signified by them, he sets
each of them individually apart by itself. “The generation” is one name, and “the essence”
is another. The essence, he tells us, “admits of the generation,” being therefore of course
something distinct from the generation. For if the generation were the essence (which is the
very thing he is constantly declaring), so that the two appellations are equivalent in sense,
he would not have said that the essence “admits of the generation”: for that would amount
to saying that the essence admits of the essence, or the generation the generation,—if, that
is, the generation were the same thing as the essence. He understands, then, the generation
to be one thing, and the essence to be another, which “admits of generation”: for that which
is taken cannot be the same with that which admits it. Well, this is what the sage and systematic
statement of our author says: but as to whether there is any sense in his words, let him
consider who is expert in judging. I will resume his actual words.</p>
<p>He says that he finds “nothing else besides the essence of the Son which admits of the
generation”; that there is no sense in his words however, is clear to every one who hears his
statement at all: the task which remains seems to be to bring to light the blasphemy which
he is trying to construct by aid of these meaningless words. For he desires, even if he cannot
effect his purpose, to produce in his hearers by this slackness of expression, the notion that
the essence of the Son is the result of construction: but he calls its construction “generation,”
decking out his horrible blasphemy with the fairest phrase, that if “construction” is the
meaning conveyed by the word “generation,” the idea of the creation of the Lord may receive
a ready assent. He says, then, that the essence “admits of generation,” so that every construction
may be viewed, as it were, in some subject matter. For no one would say that that is
constructed which has no existence, so extending “making” in his discourse, as if it were
some constructed fabric, to the nature of the Only-begotten God678. “If, then,” he says, “it
<note type="footnote">678 This whole passage, as it stands in Oehler’s text, (which has here been followed without alteration,) is
obscure: the connection between the clauses themselves is by no means clear; and the general meaning of the
passage, in view of the succeeding sentences, seems doubtful. For it seems here to be alleged that Eunomius
considered the κατασκεύη to imply the previous existence of some material, so to say, which was moulded by
generation—on the ground that no one would say that the essence, or anything else, was constructed without
being existent. On the other hand it is immediately urged that this is just what would be said of all created things.</note>

<pb n="327"/>
admits of this generation,”—wishing to convey some such meaning as this, that it would
not have been, had it not been constructed. But what else is there among the things we
contemplate in the creation which is without being made? Heaven, earth, air, sea, everything
whatever that is, surely is by being made. How, then, comes it that he considered it a peculiarity
in the nature of the Only begotten, that it “admits generation” (for this is his name
for making) “into its actual essence,” as though the humble-bee or the gnat did not admit
generation into itself679, but into something else besides itself. It is therefore acknowledged
by his own writings, that by them the essence of the Only-begotten is placed on the same
level with the smallest parts of the creation: and every proof by which he attempts to establish
the alienation of the Son from the Father has the same force also in the case of individual
things. What need has he, then, for this varied acuteness to establish the diversity of nature,
when he ought to have taken the short cut of denial, by openly declaring that the name of
the Son ought not to be confessed, or the Only-begotten God to be preached in the churches,
but that we ought to esteem the Jewish worship as superior to the faith of Christians, and,
while we confess the Father as being alone Creator and Maker of the world, to reduce all
other things to the name and conception of the creation, and among these to speak of that
work which preceded the rest as a “thing made,” which came into being by some constructive
operation, and to give Him the title of “First created,” instead of Only-begotten and Very
Son. For when these opinions have carried the day, it will be a very easy matter to bring
doctrines to a conclusion in agreement with the aim they have in view, when all are guided,
as you might expect from such a principle, to the consequence that it is impossible that He
Who is neither begotten nor a Son, but has His existence through some energy, should share
in essence with God. So long, however, as the declarations of the Gospel prevail, by which
He is proclaimed as “Son,” and “Only-begotten,” and “of the Father,” and “of God,” and
the like, Eunomius will talk his nonsense to no purpose, leading himself and his followers
astray by such idle chatter. For while the title of “Son” speaks aloud the true relation to the
Father, who is so foolish that, while John and Paul and the rest of the choir of the Saints
proclaim these words,—words of truth, and words that point to the close affinity,—he does

product of construction.” The force of this would be, that Eunomius is really employing the idea of “receiving
generation,” to imply that the essence of the Only-begotten is a κατασκεύασμα: and this, Gregory says, puts him
at once on a level with the physical creation.</note>

<p>But let all this pass, and let our earnestness about what lies before us calm down our
heart, that is swollen with jealousy on behalf of the faith against the blasphemers. For how
is it possible not to be moved to wrath and hatred, while our God, and Lord, and Life-giver,
and Saviour is insulted by these wretched men? If he had reviled my father according to the
flesh, or been at enmity with my benefactor, would it have been possible to bear without
emotion his anger against those I love? And if the Lord of my soul, Who gave it being when
it was not, and redeemed it when in bondage, and gave me to taste of this present life, and
prepared for me the life to come, Who calls us to a kingdom, and gives us His commands
that we may escape the damnation of hell,—these are small things that I speak of, and not
worthy to express the greatness of our common Lord—He that is worshipped by all creation,
by things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, by Whom stand the
unnumbered myriads of the heavenly ministers, to Whom is turned all that is under rule
here, and that has the desire of good—if He is exposed to reviling by men, for whom it is
not enough to associate themselves with the party of the apostate, but who count it loss not
to draw others by their scribbling into the same gulf with themselves, that those who come
after may not lack a hand to lead them to destruction, is there any one681 who blames us
for our anger against these men? But let us return to the sequence of his discourse.</p>
<p>He next proceeds once more to slander us as dishonouring the generation of the Son
by human similitudes, and mentions what was written on these points by our father682,
where he says that while by the word “Son” two things are signified, the being formed by
passion, and the true relationship to the begetter, he does not admit in discourses upon
things divine the former sense, which is unseemly and carnal, but in so far as the latter tends
to testify to the glory of the Only-begotten, this alone finds a place in the sublime doctrines.
Who, then, dishonours the generation of the Son by human notions? He who sets far from
the Divine generation what belongs to passion and to man, and joins the Son impassibly to
Him that begat Him? or he who places Him Who brought all things into being on a common
level with the lower creation? Such an idea, however, as it seems,—that of associating the
Son in the majesty of the Father,—this new wisdom seems to regard as dishonouring; while
it considers as great and sublime the act of bringing Him down to equality with the creation

that is in bondage with us. Empty complaints! Basil is slandered as dishonouring the Son,
who honours Him even as he honours the Father683, and Eunomius is the champion of the
Only-begotten, who severs Him from the good nature of the Father! Such a reproach Paul
also once incurred with the Athenians, being charged therewith by them as “a setter forth
of strange gods684,” when he was reproving the wandering among their gods of those who
were mad in their idolatry, and was leading them to the truth, preaching the resurrection
by the Son. These charges are now brought against Paul’s follower by the new Stoics and
Epicureans, who “spend their time in nothing else,” as the history says of the Athenians,
“but either to tell or to hear some new thing685.” For what could be found newer than this,—a
Son of an energy, and a Father of a creature, and a new God springing up from nothing,
and good at variance with good? These are they who profess to honour Him with due honour
by saying that He is not that which the nature of Him that begat Him is. Is Eunomius not
ashamed of the form of such honour, if one were to say that he himself is not akin in nature
to his father, but has community with something of another kind? If he who brings the Lord
of the creation into community with the creation declares that he honours Him by so doing,
let him also himself be honoured by having community assigned him with what is brute
and senseless: but, if he finds community with an inferior nature hard and insolent treatment,
how is it honour for Him Who, as the prophet saith, “ruleth with His power for ever686,”
to be ranked with that nature which is in subjection and bondage? But enough of this.</p>

<head>§1. The fifth book promises to speak of the words contained in the saying of the Apostle Peter,
but delays their exposition. He discourses first of the creation, to the effect that, while
nothing therein is deserving of worship, yet men, led astray by their ill-informed and feeble
intelligence, and marvelling at its beauty, deified the several parts of the universe. And
herein he excellently expounds the passage of Isaiah, “I am God, the first.”</head>
<p>It is now, perhaps, time to make enquiry into what is said concerning the words of the
Apostle Peter687, by Eunomius himself, and by our father688 concerning the latter. If a detailed
examination should extend our discourse to considerable length, the fair-minded
reader will no doubt pardon this, and will not blame us for wasting time in words, but lay
the blame on him who has given occasion for them. Let me be allowed also to make some
brief remarks preliminary to the proposed enquiry: it may be that they too will be found
not to be out of keeping with the aim of our discussion.</p>
<p>That no created thing is deserving of man’s worship, the divine word so clearly declares
as a law, that such a truth may be learned from almost the whole of the inspired Scripture.
Moses, the Tables, the Law, the Prophets that follow, the Gospels, the decrees of the Apostles,
all alike forbid the act of reverencing the creation. It would be a lengthy task to set out in
order the particular passages which refer to this matter; but though we set out only a few
from among the many instances of the inspired testimony, our argument is surely equally
convincing, since each of the divine words, albeit the least, has equal force for declaration
of the truth. Seeing, then, that our conception of existences is divided into two, the creation
and the uncreated Nature, if the present contention of our adversaries should prevail, so
that we should say that the Son of God is created, we should be absolutely compelled either
to set at naught the proclamation of the Gospel, and to refuse to worship that God the Word
Who was in the beginning, on the ground that we must not address worship to the creation,
or, if these marvels recorded in the Gospels are too urgent for us, by which we are led to
reverence and to worship Him Who is displayed in them, to place, in that case, the created
and the Uncreated on the same level of honour; seeing that if, according to our adversaries’
opinion, even the created God is worshipped, though having in His nature no prerogative
above the rest of the creation, and if this view should get the upper hand, the doctrines of
religion will be entirely transformed to a kind of anarchy and democratic independence.
For when men believe that the nature they worship is not one, but have their thoughts turned
away to diverse Godheads, there will be none who will stay the conception of the Deity in
its progress through creation, but the Divine element, once recognized in creation, will be-

come a stepping-stone to the like conception in the case of that which is next contemplated,
and that again for the next in order, and as a result of this inferential process the error will
extend to all things, as the first deceit makes its way by contiguous cases even to the very
last.</p>
<p>To show that I am not making a random statement beyond what probability admits of,
I will cite as a credible testimony in favour of my assertion the error which still prevails
among the heathen689. Seeing that they, with their untrained and narrow intelligence, were
disposed to look with wonder on the beauties of nature, not employing the things they beheld
as a leader and guide to the beauty of the Nature that transcends them, they rather made
their intelligence halt on arriving at the objects of its apprehension, and marvelled at each
part of the creation severally—for this cause they did not stay their conception of the Deity
at any single one of the things they beheld, but deemed everything they looked on in creation
to be divine. And thus with the Egyptians, as the error developed its force more in respect
of intellectual objects, the countless forms of spiritual beings were reckoned to be so many
natures of Gods; while with the Babylonians the unerring circuit of the firmament was accounted
a God, to whom they also gave the name of Bel. So, too, the foolishness of the heathen
deifying individually the seven successive spheres, one bowed down to one, another to another,
according to some individual form of error. For as they perceived all these circles
moving in mutual relation, seeing that they had gone astray as to the most exalted, they
maintained the same error by logical sequence, even to the last of them. And in addition to
these, the æther itself, and the atmosphere diffused beneath it, the earth and sea and the
subterranean region, and in the earth itself all things which are useful or needful for man’s
life,—of all these there was none which they held to be without part or lot in the Divine
nature, but they bowed down to each of them, bringing themselves, by means of some one
of the objects conspicuous in the creation, into bondage to all the successive parts of the
creation, in such a way that, had the act of reverencing the creation been from the beginning
even to them a thing evidently unlawful, they would not have been led astray into this deceit
of polytheism. Let us look to it, then, lest we too share the same fate,—we who in being
taught by Scripture to reverence the true Godhead, were trained to consider all created existence
as external to the Divine nature, and to worship and revere that uncreated Nature
alone, Whose characteristic and token is that it never either begins to be or ceases to be;
since the great Isaiah thus speaks of the Divine nature with reference to these doctrines, in
his exalted utterance,—who speaks in the person of the Deity, “I am the first, and hereafter
am I, and no God was before Me, and no God shall be after Me690.” For knowing more

perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel, this great prophet, who
foretold even that marvellous sign concerning the Virgin, and gave us the good tidings691
of the birth of the Child, and clearly pointed out to us that Name of the Son,—he, in a word,
who by the Spirit includes in himself all the truth,—in order that the characteristic of the
Divine Nature, whereby we discern that which really is from that which came into being,
might be made as plain as possible to all, utters this saying in the person of God: “I am the
first, and hereafter am I, and before Me no God hath been, and after Me is none.” Since,
then, neither is that God which was before God, nor is that God which is after God, (for
that which is after God is the creation, and that which is anterior to God is nothing, and
Nothing is not God;—or one should rather say, that which is anterior to God is God in His
eternal blessedness, defined in contradistinction to Nothing692;—since, I say, this inspired
utterance was spoken by the mouth of the prophet, we learn by his means the doctrine that
the Divine Nature is one, continuous with Itself and indiscerptible, not admitting in Itself
priority and posteriority, though it be declared in Trinity, and with no one of the things we
contemplate in it more ancient or more recent than another. Since, then, the saying is the
saying of God, whether you grant that the words are the words of the Father or of the Son,
the orthodox doctrine is equally upheld by either. For if it is the Father that speaks thus, He
bears witness to the Son that He is not “after” Himself: for if the Son is God, and whatever
is “after” the Father is not God, it is clear that the saying bears witness to the truth that the
Son is in the Father, and not after the Father. If, on the other hand, one were to grant that
this utterance is of the Son, the phrase, “None hath been before Me,” will be a clear intimation
that He Whom we contemplate “in the Beginning693” is apprehended together with the
eternity of the Beginning. If, then, anything is “after” God, this is discovered, by the passages
quoted, to be a creature, and not God: for He says, “That which is after Me is not God694.”</p>

<head>§2. He then explains the phrase of S. Peter, “Him God made Lord and Christ.” And herein he
sets forth the opposing statement of Eunomius, which he made on account of such phrase
against S. Basil, and his lurking revilings and insults.</head>
<p>Now that we have had presented to us this preliminary view of existences, it may be
opportune to examine the passage before us. It is said, then, by Peter to the Jews, “Him God
made Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified695,” while on our part it is said that it
is not pious to refer the word “made” to the Divine Nature of the Only-begotten, but that
it is to be referred to that “form of a servant696,” which came into being by the Incarnation697,
in the due time of His appearing in the flesh; and, on the other hand, those who press the
phrase the contrary way say that in the word “made” the Apostle indicates the pretemporal
generation of the Son. We shall, therefore, set forth the passage in the midst, and after a
detailed examination of both the suppositions, leave the judgment of the truth to our reader.
Of our adversaries’ view Eunomius himself may be a sufficient advocate, for he contends
gallantly on the matter, so that in going through his argument word by word we shall completely
follow out the reasoning of those who strive against us: and we ourselves will act as
champion of the doctrine on our side as best we may, following so far as we are able the line
of the argument previously set forth by the great Basil. But do you, who by your reading act
as judges in the cause, “execute true judgment,” as one of the prophets698 says, not awarding
the victory to contentious preconceptions, but to the truth as it is manifested by examination.
And now let the accuser of our doctrines come forward, and read his indictment, as in a
court of law.</p>
<p>“In addition, moreover, to what we have mentioned, by his refusal to take the word
‘made’ as referring to the essence of the Son, and withal by his being ashamed of the Cross,
he ascribes to the Apostles what no one even of those who have done their best to speak ill
of them on the score of stupidity, lays to their charge; and at the same time he clearly introduces,
by his doctrines and arguments, two Christs and two Lords; for he says that it was
not the Word Who was in the beginning Whom God made Lord and Christ, but He Who
‘emptied Himself to take the form of a servant699,’ and ‘was crucified through weakness700.’
At all events the great Basil writes expressly as follows701:—‘Nor, moreover, is it the intention
of the Apostle to present to us that existence of the Only-begotten which was before the

<pb n="334"/>
ages (which is now the subject of our argument), for he clearly speaks, not of the very essence
of God the Word, Who was in the beginning with God, but of Him Who emptied Himself
to take the form of a servant, and became conformable to the body of our humiliation702,
and was crucified through weakness.’ And again, ‘This is known to any one who even in a
small degree applies his mind to the meaning of the Apostle’s words, that he is not setting
forth to us the mode of the Divine existence, but is introducing the terms which belong to
the Incarnation; for he says, Him God made Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified,
evidently laying stress by the demonstrative word on that in Him which was human and
was seen by all703.’</p>
<p>“This, then, is what the man has to say who substitutes,—for we may not speak of it as
‘application,’ lest any one should blame for such madness men holy and chosen for the
preaching of godliness, so as to reproach their doctrine with a fall into such extravagance,—
who substitutes his own mind704 for the intention of the Apostles! With what confusion
are they not filled, who refer their own nonsense to the memory of the saints! With
what absurdity do they not abound, who imagine that the man ‘emptied himself’ to become
man, and who maintain that He Who by obedience ‘humbled himself’ to take the form of
a servant was made conformable to men even before He took that form upon Him! Who,
pray, ye most reckless of men, when he has the form of a servant, takes the form of a servant?
and how can any one ‘empty himself’ to become the very thing which he is? You will find
no contrivance to meet this, bold as you are in saying or thinking things uncontrivable. Are
you not verily of all men most miserable, who suppose that a man has suffered death for all
men, and ascribe your own redemption to him? For if it is not of the Word Who was in the
beginning and was God that the blessed Peter speaks, but of him who was ‘seen,’ and who
‘emptied Himself,’ as Basil says, and if the man who was seen ‘emptied Himself’ to take ‘the
form of a servant,’ and He Who ‘emptied Himself’ to take ‘the form of a servant,’ emptied
Himself to come into being as man, then the man who was seen emptied himself to come
into being as man705. The very nature of things is repugnant to this; and it is expressly

<note type="footnote">705 The argument here takes the form of a reductio ad absurdum; assuming that S. Peter’s reference is to the
“visible man,” and bearing in mind S. Basil’s words that S. Peter refers to Him Who “emptied Himself,” it is said
“then it was the ‘visible man’ who ‘emptied himself.’ But the purpose of that ‘emptying’ was the ‘taking the form
of a servant,’ which again is the coming into being as man: therefore the ‘visible man’ ‘emptied himself,’ to come
into being as man, which is absurd.” The wording of S. Basil’s statement makes the argument in a certain degree
plausible;—if he had said that S. Peter referred to the Son, not in regard to his actual essence, but in regard to</note>

<pb n="335"/>
contradicted by that writer706 who celebrates this dispensation in his discourse concerning
the Divine Nature, when he says not that the man who was seen, but that the Word Who
was in the beginning and was God took upon Him flesh, which is equivalent in other words
to taking ‘the form of a servant.’ If, then, you hold that these things are to be believed, depart
from your error, and cease to believe that the man ‘emptied himself’ to become man. And
if you are not able to persuade those who will not be persuaded, destroy their incredulity
by another saying, a second decision against them. Remember him who says, ‘Who being
in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking
the form of a servant.’ There is none among men who will appropriate this phrase to himself.
None of the saints that ever lived was the Only-begotten God and became man:—for that
is what it means to ‘take the form of a servant,’ ‘being in the form of God.’ If, then, the
blessed Peter speaks of Him Who ‘emptied Himself’ to ‘take the form of a servant,’ and if
He Who was ‘in the form of God’ did ‘empty Himself’ to ‘take the form of a servant,’ and if
He Who in the beginning was God, being the Word and the Only-begotten God, is He Who
was ‘in the form of God,’ then the blessed Peter speaks to us of Him Who was in the beginning
and was God, and expounds to us that it was He Who became Lord and Christ. This, then,
is the conflict which Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have
‘applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles’, nor to be able to preserve the sequence
of his own arguments; for, according to them, he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable
character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord;
or if he tries to fit together statements that are mutually conflicting, and contentiously stands
by them, he will add to them others yet more hostile, and maintain that there are two Christs
and two Lords. For if the Word that was in the beginning and was God be one, and He Who
‘emptied Himself’ and ‘took the form of a servant’ be another, and if God the Word, by
Whom are all things, be Lord, and this Jesus, Who was crucified after all things had come
into being, be Lord also, there are, according to his view, two Lords and Christs. Our author,
then, cannot by any argument clear himself from this manifest blasphemy. But if any one
were to say in support of him that the Word Who was in the beginning is indeed the same
Who became Lord, but that He became Lord and Christ in respect of His presence in the
flesh, He will surely be constrained to say that the Son was not Lord before His presence in
the flesh. At all events, even if Basil and his faithless followers falsely proclaim two Lords
and two Christs, for us there is one Lord and Christ, by Whom all things were made, not
<note type="footnote">the fact that He “emptied Himself” to become man, and as so having “emptied Himself” (which is no doubt
what he intended his words to mean), then the reductio ad absurdum would not apply; nor would the later arguments,
by which Eunomius proceeds to prove that He Who “emptied Himself” was no mere man, but the
Word Who was in the beginning, have any force as against S. Basil’s statement.</note>

becoming Lord by way of promotion, but existing before all creation and before all ages,
the Lord Jesus, by Whom are all things, while all the saints with one harmonious voice teach
us this truth and proclaim it as the most excellent of doctrines. Here the blessed John teaches
us that God the Word, by Whom all things were made, has become incarnate, saying, ‘And
the Word was made flesh707’; here the most admirable Paul, urging those who attend to
him to humility, speaks of Christ Jesus, Who was in the form of God, and emptied Himself
to take the form of a servant, and was humbled to death, even the death of the Cross708; and
again in another passage calls Him Who was crucified ‘the Lord of Glory’: ‘for had they
known it,’ he says, ‘they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory709’. Indeed, he speaks
far more openly than this of the very essential nature by the name of ‘Lord,’ where he says,
‘Now the Lord is the Spirit710’. If, then, the Word Who was in the beginning, in that He is
Spirit, is Lord, and the Lord of glory, and if God made Him Lord and Christ, it was the very
Spirit and God the Word that God so made, and not some other Lord Whom Basil dreams
about.”</p>

<head>§3. A remarkable and original reply to these utterances, and a demonstration of the power of
the Crucified, and of the fact that this subjection was of the Human Nature, not that
which the Only-Begotten has from the Father. Also an explanation of the figure of the
Cross, and of the appellation “Christ,” and an account of the good gifts bestowed on the

<p>Well, such is his accusation. But I think it necessary in the first place to go briefly, by
way of summary, over the points that he urges, and then to proceed to correct by my argument
what he has said, that those who are judging the truth may find it easy to remember
the indictment against us, which we have to answer, and that we may be able to dispose of
each of the charges in regular order. He says that we are ashamed of the Cross of Christ,
and slander the saints, and say that a man has “emptied himself” to become man, and suppose
that the Lord had the “form of a servant” before His presence by the Incarnation, and ascribe
our redemption to a man, and speak in our doctrine of two Christs and two Lords, or, if we
do not do this, then we deny that the Only-begotten was Lord and Christ before the Passion.
So that we may avoid this blasphemy, he will have us confess that the essence of the Son has
been made, on the ground that the Apostle Peter by his own voice establishes such a doctrine.
This is the substance of the accusation; for all that he has been at the trouble of saying by
way of abuse of ourselves, I will pass by in silence, as being not at all to the point. It may be
that this rhetorical stroke of phrases framed according to some artificial theory is the ordinary
habit of those who play the rhetorician, an invention to swell the bulk of their indictment.
Let our sophist then use his art to display his insolence, and vaunt his strength in reproaches
against us, showing off his strokes in the intervals of the contest; let him call us foolish, call
us of all men most reckless, of all men most miserable, full of confusion and absurdity, and
make light of us at his good pleasure in any way he likes, and we will bear it; for to a reasonable
man disgrace lies, not in hearing one who abuses him, but in making retort to what he
says. There may even be some good in his expenditure of breath against us; for it may be
that while he occupies his railing tongue in denouncing us he will at all events make some
truce in his conflict against God. So let him take his fill of insolence as he likes: none will
reply to him. For if a man has foul and loathsome breath, by reason of bodily disorder, or
of some pestilential and malignant disease, he would not rouse any healthy person to emulate
his misfortune so that one should choose, by himself acquiring disease, to repay, in the same
evil kind, the unpleasantness of the man’s ill odour. Such men our common nature bids us
to pity, not to imitate. And so let us pass by everything of this kind which by mockery, indignation,
provocation, and abuse, he has assiduously mixed up with his argument, and
examine only his arguments as they concern the doctrinal points at issue. We shall begin
again, then, from the beginning, and meet each of his charges in turn.</p>
<p>The beginning of his accusation was that we are ashamed of the Cross of Him Who for
our sakes underwent the Passion. Surely he does not intend to charge against us also that

<pb n="338"/>
we preach the doctrine of dissimilarity in essence! Why, it is rather to those who turn aside
to this opinion that the reproach belongs of going about to make the Cross a shameful thing.
For if by both parties alike the dispensation of the Passion is held as part of the faith, while
we hold it necessary to honour, even as the Father is honoured, the God Who was manifested
by the Cross, and they find the Passion a hindrance to glorifying the Only-begotten God
equally with the Father that begat Him, then our sophist’s charges recoil upon himself, and
in the words with which he imagines himself to be accusing us, he is publishing his own
doctrinal impiety. For it is clear that the reason why he sets the Father above the Son, and
exalts Him with supreme honour, is this,—that in Him is not seen the shame of the Cross:
and the reason why he asseverates that the nature of the Son varies in the sense of inferiority
is this,—that the reproach of the Cross is referred to Him alone, and does not touch the
Father. And let no one think that in saying this I am only following the general drift of his
composition, for in going through all the blasphemy of his speech, which is there laboriously
brought together, I found, in a passage later than that before us, this very blasphemy clearly
expressed in undisguised language; and I propose to set forth, in the orderly course of my
own argument, what they have written, which runs thus:—“If,” he says, “he can show that
the God Who is over all, Who is the unapproachable Light, was incarnate, or could be incarnate,
came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the
Cross, then let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.” Who then is it who is ashamed
of the Cross? he who, even after the Passion, worships the Son equally with the Father, or
he who even before the Passion insults Him, not only by ranking Him with the creation,
but by maintaining that He is of passible nature, on the ground that He could not have come
to experience His sufferings had He not had a nature capable of such sufferings? We on our
part assert that even the body in which He underwent His Passion, by being mingled with
the Divine Nature, was made by that commixture to be that which the assuming711 Nature
is. So far are we from entertaining any low idea concerning the Only-begotten God, that if
anything belonging to our lowly nature was assumed in His dispensation of love for man,
we believe that even this was transformed to what is Divine and incorruptible712; but Eunomius
makes the suffering of the Cross to be a sign of divergence in essence, in the sense of
inferiority, considering, I know not how, the surpassing act of power, by which He was able
to perform this, to be an evidence of weakness; failing to perceive the fact that, while nothing
which moves according to its own nature is looked upon as surprisingly wonderful, all things
that overpass the limitations of their own nature become especially the objects of admiration,

ascending above the human nature and being made Divine (θεοποιούμενον).”</note>

and to them every ear is turned, every mind is attentive, in wonder at the marvel. And hence
it is that all who preach the word point out the wonderful character of the mystery in this
respect,—that “God was manifested in the flesh713,” that “the Word was made flesh714,”
that “the Light shined in darkness715,” “the Life tasted death,” and all such declarations
which the heralds of the faith are wont to make, whereby is increased the marvellous char-
acter of Him Who manifested the superabundance of His power by means external to his
own nature. But though they think fit to make this a subject for their insolence, though they
make the dispensation of the Cross a reason for partitioning off the Son from equality of
glory with the Father, we believe, as those “who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and
ministers of the word716” delivered to us by the Holy Scriptures, that the God who was in
the beginning, “afterwards”, as Baruch says, “was seen upon the earth, and conversed with
men717,” and, becoming a ransom for our death, loosed by His own resurrection the bonds
of death, and by Himself made the resurrection a way for all flesh718, and being on the same
throne and in the same glory with His own Father, will in the day of judgment give sentence
upon those who are judged, according to the desert of the lives they have led. These are the
things which we believe concerning Him Who was crucified, and for this cause we cease
not to extol Him exceedingly, according to the measure of our powers, that He Who by
reason of His unspeakable and unapproachable greatness is not comprehensible by any,
save by Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit, He, I say, was able even to descend to
community with our weakness. But they adduce this proof of the Son’s alienation in nature
from the Father, that the Lord was manifested by the flesh and by the Cross, arguing on the
ground that the Father’s nature remained pure in impassibility, and could not in any way
admit of a community which tended to passion, while the Son, by reason of the divergence
of His nature by way of humiliation, was not incapable of being brought to experience the
flesh and death, seeing that the change of condition was not great, but one which took place
in a certain sense from one like state to another state kindred and homogeneous, because
the nature of man is created, and the nature of the Only-begotten is created also. Who then
is fairly charged with being ashamed of the Cross? he who speaks basely of it719, or he who
contends for its more exalted aspect? I know not whether our accuser, who thus abases the

God Who was made known upon the Cross, has heard the lofty speech of Paul, in what
terms and at what length he discourses with his exalted lips concerning that Cross. For he,
who was able to make himself known by miracles so many and so great, says, “God forbid
that I should glory in anything else, than in the Cross of Christ720.” And to the Corinthians
he says that the word of the Cross is “the power of God to them that are in a state of salvation721.”
To the Ephesians, moreover, he describes by the figure of the Cross the power that
controls and holds together the universe, when he expresses a desire that they may be exalted
to know the exceeding glory of this power, calling it height, and depth, and breadth, and
length722, speaking of the several projections we behold in the figure of the Cross by their
proper names, so that he calls the upper part “height,” and that which is below, on the opposite
side of the junction, “depth,” while by the name “length and breadth” he indicates
the cross-beam projecting to either side, that hereby might be manifested this great mystery,
that both things in heaven, and things under the earth, and all the furthest bounds of the
things that are, are ruled and sustained by Him Who gave an example of this unspeakable
and mighty power in the figure of the Cross. But I think there is no need to contend further
with such objections, as I judge it superfluous to be anxious about urging arguments against
calumny when even a few words suffice to show the truth. Let us therefore pass on to another
charge.</p>
<p>He says that by us the saints are slandered. Well, if he has heard it himself, let him tell
us the words of our defamation: if he thinks we have uttered it to others, let him show the
truth of his charge by witnesses: if he demonstrates it from what we have written, let him
read the words, and we will bear the blame. But he cannot bring forward anything of the
kind: our writings are open for examination to any one who desires it. If it was not said to
himself, and he has not heard it from others, and has no proof to offer from our writings, I
think he who has to make answer on this point may well hold his peace: silence is surely the
fitting answer to an unfounded charge.</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter says, “God made this Jesus, Whom ye crucified, Lord and Christ723.”
We, learning this from him, say that the whole context of the passage tends one way,—the
Cross itself, the human name, the indicative turn of the phrase. For the word of the Scripture
says that in regard to one person two things were wrought,—by the Jews, the Passion, and
by God, honour; not as though one person had suffered and another had been honoured
by exaltation: and he further explains this yet more clearly by his words in what follows,
“being exalted by the right hand of God.” Who then was “exalted”? He that was lowly, or

<pb n="341"/>
He that was the Highest? and what else is the lowly, but the Humanity? what else is the
Highest, but the Divinity? Surely, God needs not to be exalted, seeing that He is the Highest.
It follows, then, that the Apostle’s meaning is that the Humanity was exalted: and its exaltation
was effected by its becoming Lord and Christ. And this took place after the Passion.724
It is not therefore the pre-temporal existence of the Lord which the Apostle indicates by the
word “made,” but that change of the lowly to the lofty which was effected “by the right hand
of God.” Even by this phrase is declared the mystery of godliness; for he who says “exalted
by the right hand of God” manifestly reveals the unspeakable dispensation of this mystery,
that the Right Hand of God, that made all things that are, (which is the Lord, by Whom all
things were made, and without Whom nothing that is subsists,) Itself raised to Its own height
the Man united with It, making Him also to be what It is by nature. Now It is Lord and King:
Christ is the King’s name: these things It made Him too. For as He was highly exalted by
being in the Highest, so too He became all else,—Immortal in the Immortal, Light in the
Light, Incorruptible in the Incorruptible, Invisible in the Invisible, Christ in the Christ, Lord
in the Lord. For even in physical combinations. when one of the combined parts exceeds
the other in a great degree, the inferior is wont to change completely to that which is more
potent. And this we are plainly taught by the voice of the Apostle Peter in his mystic discourse,
that the lowly nature of Him Who was crucified through weakness, (and weakness,
as we have heard from the Lord, marks the flesh725,) that lowly nature, I say, by virtue of
its combination with the infinite and boundless element of good, remained no longer in its
own measures and properties, but was by the Right Hand of God raised up together with
Itself, and became Lord instead of servant, Christ a King instead of a subject, Highest instead
of Lowly, God instead of man. What handle then against the saints did he who pretends to
give warning against us in defence of the Apostles find in the material of our writings? Let
us pass over this charge also in silence; for I think it a mean and unworthy thing to stand
up against charges that are false and unfounded. Let us pass on to the more pressing part
of his accusation.</p>
<note type="footnote">724 It can hardly be supposed that it is intended by S. Gregory that we should understand that, during the
years of His life on earth, our Lord’s Humanity was not so united with His Divinity that “the visible man” was
then both Lord and Christ. He probably refers more especially to the manifestation of His Messiahship afforded
by the Resurrection and Ascension; but he also undoubtedly dwells on the exaltation of the Human Nature after
the Passion in terms which would perhaps imply more than he intended to convey. His language on this point
may be compared with the more guarded and careful statement of Hooker. (Eccl. Pol. V. lv. 8.) The point of his
argument is that S. Peter’s words apply to the Human Nature, not to the Divine.</note>

<head>§4. He shows the falsehood of Eunomius’ calumnious charge that the great Basil had said that
“man was emptied to become man,” and demonstrates that the “emptying” of the Onlybegotten
took place with a view to the restoration to life of the Man Who had suffered726.</head>
<p>He asserts that we say that man has emptied Himself to become man, and that He Who
by obedience humbled Himself to the form of the servant shared the form of men even before
He took that form. No change has been made in the wording; we have simply transferred
the very words from his speech to our own. Now if there is anything of this sort in our
writings, (for I call my master’s writings ours) let no one blame our orator for calumny. I
ask for all regard for the truth: and we ourselves will give evidence. But if there is nothing
of all this in our writings, while his language not merely lays blame upon us, but is indignant
and wrathful as if the matter were clearly proved, calling us full of absurdity, nonsense,
confusion, inconsistency, and so on, I am at a loss to see the right course to take. Just as men
who are perplexed at the groundless rages of madmen can decide upon no plan to follow,
so I myself can find no device to meet this perplexity. Our master says (for I will again recite
his argument verbally), “He is not setting forth to us the mode of the Divine existence, but
the terms which belong to the Incarnation.” Our accuser starts from this point, and says
that we maintain that man emptied Himself to become man! What community is there
between one statement and the other? If we say that the Apostle has not set forth to us the
mode of the Divine existence, but points by his phrase to the dispensation of the Passion,
we are on this ground charged with speaking of the “emptying” of man to become man, and
with saying that the “form of the servant” had pretemporal existence, and that the Man Who
was born of Mary existed before the coming in the flesh! Well, I think it superfluous to
spend time in discussing what is admitted, seeing that truth itself frees us from the charge.
In a case, indeed, where one may have given the calumniators some handle against oneself,
it is proper to resist accusers: but where there is no danger of being suspected of some absurd
charge, the accusation becomes a proof, not of the false charge made against him who is
calumniated, but of the madness of the accuser. As, however, in dealing with the charge of
being ashamed of the Cross, we showed by our examination that the charge recoiled upon
the accuser, so we shall show how this charge too returns upon those who make it, since it
is they, and not we, who lay down the doctrine of the change of the Son from like to like in
the dispensation of the Passion. We will examine briefly, bringing them side by side, the
statements of each party. We say that the Only-begotten God, having by His own agency

a different reading, “contigisse, quando in passione homo Christus passus est.”</note>

<pb n="343"/>
brought all things into being, by Himself727 has full power over all things, while the nature
of man is also one of the things that were made by Him: and that when this had fallen away
to evil, and come to be in the destruction of death, He by His own agency drew it up once
more to immortal life, by means of the Man in whom He tabernacled, taking to Himself
humanity in completeness, and that He mingled His life-giving power with our mortal and
perishable nature, and changed, by the combination with Himself, our deadness to living
grace and power. And this we declare to be the mystery of the Lord according to the flesh,
that He Who is immutable came to be in that which is mutable, to the end that altering it
for the better, and changing it from the worse, He might abolish the evil which is mingled
with our mutable condition, destroying the evil in Himself. For “our God is a consuming
fire728,” by whom all the material of wickedness is done away. This is our statement. What
does our accuser say? Not that He Who was immutable and uncreated was mingled with
that which came into being by creation, and which had therefore suffered a change in the
direction of evil; but he does say that He, being Himself created, came to that which was
kindred and homogeneous with Himself, not coming from a transcendent nature to put on
the lowlier nature by reason of His love to man, but becoming that very thing which He
was.</p>
<p>For as regards the general character of the appellation, the name of “creature” is one,
as predicated of all things that have come into being from nothing, while the divisions into
sections of the things which we contemplate as included in the term “creature”, are separated
one from the other by the variation of their properties: so that if He is created, and man is
created, He was “emptied,” to use Eunomius’ phrase, to become Himself, and changed His
place, not from the transcendent to the lowly, but from what is similar in kind to what (save
in regard of the special character of body and the incorporeal) is similar in dignity. To whom
now will the just vote of those who have to try our cause be given, or who will seem to them
to be under the weight of these charges? he who says that the created was saved by the uncreated
God, or he who refers the cause of our salvation to the creature? Surely the judgment
of pious men is not doubtful. For any one who knows clearly the difference which there is
between the created and the uncreated, (terms of which the divergence is marked by
dominion and slavery, since the uncreated God, as the prophet says, “ruleth with His power
for ever729,” while all things in the creation are servants to Him, according to the voice of
the same prophet, which says “all things serve Thee730,”) he, I say, who carefully considers
<note type="footnote">727 This seems to be the force of αὐτῷ; αὐτὸν might give a simpler construction, but the sense would not be

these matters, surely cannot fail to recognize the person who makes the Only-begotten
change from servitude to servitude. For if, according to Paul, the whole creation “is in
bondage731,” and if, according to Eunomius, the essential nature of the Only-begotten is
created, our adversaries maintain, surely, by their doctrines, not that the master was mingled
with the servant, but that a servant came to be among servants. As for our saying that the
Lord was in the form of a servant before His presence in the flesh, that is just like charging
us with saying that the stars are black and the sun misty, and the sky low, and water dry,
and so on:—a man who does not maintain a charge on the ground of what he has heard,
but makes up what seems good to him at his own sweet will, need not be sparing in making
against us such charges as these. It is just the same thing for us to be called to account for
the one set of charges as for the other, so far as concerns the fact that they have no basis for
them in anything that we have said. How could one who says distinctly that the true Son
was in the glory of the Father, insult the eternal glory of the Only-begotten by conceiving
it to have been “in the form of a servant”? When our author thinks proper to speak evil of
us, and at the same time takes care to present his case with some appearance of truth, it may
perhaps not be superfluous or useless to rebut his unfounded accusations.</p>

<head>§5. Thereafter he shows that there are not two Christs or two Lords, but one Christ and one
Lord, and that the Divine nature, after mingling with the Human, preserved the properties
of each nature without confusion, and declares that the operations are, by reason of the
union, predicated of the two natures in common, in the sense that the Lord took upon
Himself the sufferings of the servant, and the humanity is glorified with Him in the honour
that is the Lord’s, and that by the power of the Divine Nature that is made anew, conformably
with that Divine Nature Itself.</head>
<p>His next charge too has its own absurdity of the same sort. For he reproaches us with
saying that there are “two Christs,” and “two Lords,” without being able to make good his
charge from our words, but employing falsehood at discretion to suit his fancy. Since, then,
he deems it within his power to say what he likes, why does he utter his falsehood with such
care about detail, and maintain that we speak but of two Christs? Let him say, if he likes,
that we preach ten Christs, or ten times ten, or extend the number to a thousand, that he
may handle his calumny more vigorously. For blasphemy is equally involved in the doctrine
of two Christs, and in that of more, and the character of the two charges is also equally
devoid of proof. When he shows, then, that we do speak of two Christs, let him have a verdict
against us, as much as though he had given proof of ten thousand. But he says that he convicts
us by our own statements. Well, let us look once more at those words of our master by
means of which he thinks to raise his charges against us. He says “he” (he, that is, who says
“Him God made Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified”) “is not setting forth to us
the mode of the Divine existence, but the terms which belong to the Incarnation…laying
stress by the demonstrative word on that in Him which was human and was seen by all.”
This is what he wrote. But whence has Eunomius managed by these words to bring on the
stage his “two Christs”? Does saying that the demonstrative word lays stress on that which
is visible, convey the proof of maintaining “two Christs”? Ought we (to avoid being charged
with speaking of “two Highests”) to deny the fact that by Him the Lord was highly exalted
after His Passion? seeing that God the Word, Who was in the beginning, was Highest, and
was also highly exalted after His Passion when He rose from the dead, as the Apostle says.
We must of necessity choose one of two courses—either say that He was highly exalted after
the Passion (which is just the same as saying that He was made Lord and Christ), and be
impeached by Eunomius, or, if we avoid the accusation, deny the confession of the high
exaltation of Him Who suffered.</p>
<p>Now at this point it seems right to put forward once more our accuser’s statement in
support of our own defence. We shall therefore repeat word for word the statement laid
down by him, which supports our argument as follows:—“The blessed John,” he says,
“teaches us that God the Word, by Whom all things were made, has become incarnate,
saying ‘And the Word was made flesh.’” Does he understand what he is writing when he
adds this to his own argument? I can hardly myself think that the same man can at once be

<pb n="346"/>
aware of the meaning of these words and contend against our statement. For if any one examines
the words carefully, he will find that there is no mutual conflict between what is said
by us and what is said by him. For we both consider the dispensation in the flesh apart, and
regard the Divine power in itself: and he, in like manner with ourselves, says that the Word
that was in the beginning has been manifested in the flesh: yet no one ever charged him,
nor does he charge himself, with preaching “two Words”, Him Who was in the beginning,
and Him Who was made flesh; for he knows, surely, that the Word is identical with the
Word, He who appeared in the flesh with Him Who was with God. But the flesh was not
identical with the Godhead, till this too was transformed to the Godhead, so that of necessity
one set of attributes befits God the Word, and a different set of attributes befits the “form
of the servant732.” If, then, in view of such a confession, he does not reproach himself with
the duality of Words, why are we falsely charged with dividing the object of our faith into
“two Christs”?—we, who say that He Who was highly exalted after His Passion, was made
Lord and Christ by His union733 with Him Who is verily Lord and Christ, knowing by what
we have learnt that the Divine Nature is always one and the same, and with the same mode
of existence, while the flesh in itself is that which reason and sense apprehend concerning
it, but when mixed734 with the Divine no longer remains in its own limitations and properties,
but is taken up to that which is overwhelming and transcendent. Our contemplation, however,
of the respective properties of the flesh and of the Godhead remains free from confusion,
so long as each of these is contemplated by itself735, as, for example, “the Word was before
the ages, but the flesh came into being in the last times”: but one could not reverse this
statement, and say that the latter is pretemporal, or that the Word has come into being in
the last times. The flesh is of a passible, the Word of an operative nature: and neither is the
<note type="footnote">732 This statement would seem to imply that, at some time after the Incarnation, the Humanity of Christ was
transformed to the Divine Nature, and made identical with It. From other passages in what has preceded, it
would seem that this change in the mutual relation of the two Natures might, according to the words of S.
Gregory, be conceived as taking place after the Passion. Thus it might be said that S. Gregory conceived the
union of the two Natures to be, since the Passion (or, more strictly, since the “exaltation”), what the Monophysites
conceived it to be from the moment of the Incarnation. But other phrases, again, seem to show that he conceived
the two Natures still to remain distinct (see note 4 inf.). There is, however, ample justification in S. Gregory’s
language for the remark of Bp. Hefele, that S. Gregory “cannot entirely free himself from the notion of a transmutation
of the Human Nature into the Divine.” (Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Eng. Trans. vol. iii. p. 4.)</note>

flesh capable of making the things that are, nor is the power possessed by the Godhead
capable of suffering. The Word was in the beginning with God, the man was subject to the
trial of death; and neither was the Human Nature from everlasting, nor the Divine Nature
mortal: and all the rest of the attributes are contemplated in the same way. It is not the Human
Nature that raises up Lazarus, nor is it the power that cannot suffer that weeps for him when
he lies in the grave: the tear proceeds from the Man, the life from the true Life. It is not the
Human Nature that feeds the thousands, nor is it omnipotent might that hastens to the figtree.
Who is it that is weary with the journey, and Who is it that by His word made all the
world subsist? What is the brightness of the glory, and what is that that was pierced with
the nails? What form is it that is buffeted in the Passion, and what form is it that is glorified
from everlasting? So much as this is clear, (even if one does not follow the argument into
detail,) that the blows belong to the servant in whom the Lord was, the honours to the Lord
Whom the servant compassed about, so that by reason of contact and the union of Natures
the proper attributes of each belong to both736, as the Lord receives the stripes of the servant,
while the servant is glorified with the honour of the Lord; for this is why the Cross is said
to be the Cross of the Lord of glory737, and why every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father738.</p>
<p>But if we are to discuss the other points in the same way, let us consider what it is that
dies, and what it is that destroys death; what it is that is renewed, and what it is that empties
itself. The Godhead “empties” Itself that It may come within the capacity of the Human
Nature, and the Human Nature is renewed by becoming Divine through its commixture739
with the Divine. For as air is not retained in water when it is dragged down by some weighty
body and left in the depth of the water, but rises quickly to its kindred element, while the
water is often raised up together with the air in its upward rush, being moulded by the circle
of air into a convex shape with a slight and membrane-like surface, so too, when the true
Life that underlay the flesh sped up, after the Passion, to Itself, the flesh also was raised up
with It, being forced upwards from corruption to incorruptibility by the Divine immortality.
And as fire that lies in wood hidden below the surface is often unobserved by the senses of
those who see, or even touch it, but is manifest when it blazes up, so too, at His death (which
He brought about at His will, Who separated His soul from His Body, Who said to His own

“exaltation,” and the distinction of the two Natures after that event.</note>

Man born of Mary to be Christ, and Him Who was crucified through weakness to be Life
and power, and making all that is piously conceived to be in God the Word to be also in
that which the Word assumed, so that these attributes no longer seem to be in either Nature
by way of division, but that the perishable Nature being, by its commixture with the Divine,
made anew in conformity with the Nature that overwhelms it, participates in the power of
the Godhead, as if one were to say that mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep
to be sea, by reason that the natural quality of this liquid does not continue in the infinity
of that which overwhelms it743. This is our doctrine, which does not, as Eunomius charges
against it, preach a plurality of Christs, but the union of the Man with the Divinity, and
which calls by the name of “making” the transmutation of the Mortal to the Immortal, of
the Servant to the Lord, of Sin744 to Righteousness, of the Curse745 to the Blessing, of the
Man to Christ. What further have our slanderers left to say, to show that we preach “two
Christs” in our doctrine, if we refuse to say that He Who was in the beginning from the
Father uncreatedly Lord, and Christ, and the Word, and God, was “made,” and declare that
the blessed Peter was pointing briefly and incidentally to the mystery of the Incarnation,
according to the meaning now explained, that the Nature which was crucified through
weakness has Itself also, as we have said, become, by the overwhelming power of Him Who
dwells in It, that which the Indweller Himself is in fact and in name, even Christ and Lord?</p>

<head>§1. The sixth book shows that He Who came for man’s salvation was not a mere man, as Eunomius,
falsely slandering him, affirmed that the great Basil had said, but the Only-begotten
Son of God, putting on human flesh, and becoming a mediator between God and man,
on Whom we believe, as subject to suffering in the flesh, but impassible in His Godhead;
and demonstrates the calumny of Eunomius.</head>
<p>But I perceive that while the necessities of the subject compelled me to follow this line
of thought, I have lingered too long over this passage746. I must now resume the train of his
complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer.
And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that
an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been
to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly
deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous
accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an
ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so
great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, “let
him be anathema747.” For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human
name748. Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby
strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human
nature749:—yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference
of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity
of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the
opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in
the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse750. For if
he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly
to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting
of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in

<note type="footnote">749 The sense of this passage is rather obscure. S. Gregory intends, it would seem, to point out that, although
an acknowledgment that the suffering Christ was more than man may seem at first sight to support the Eunomian
view of the passibility of the Godhead of the Son, this is not its necessary effect. Apparently either οὐ μὴν
must be taken as equivalent to οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ, or a clause such as that expressed in the translation must be supplied
before τοῖς μὲν γὰρ κ.τ.λ.</note>

a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other.
Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man,
they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion,
and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own
absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while
that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially
different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us,
though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles
and hypotheses for every kind of doctrinal pravity, it would seem right that our readers
should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute
our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable
of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which
declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God751, and that afterward the
Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men752, we admit in our
creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear
that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all
things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed,
referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble,
of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else
of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none
the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which
we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the
peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on
the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in
the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is
mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we
assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive
in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead,
and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and
whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by
means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead
works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise
that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to
the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, “God spared not His own

Son,753” and, “God sent His own Son754,” and other similar phrases which seem to refer,
in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none
the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more
clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in
Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, “for since by man came death, by man
came also the resurrection of the dead755,” and, “God, sending His own Son in the likeness
of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh756” (for he says, “in the flesh,” not “in the Godhead”);
and “He was crucified through weakness” (where by “weakness” he means “the
flesh”), “yet liveth by power757” (while he indicates by “power” the Divine Nature); and,
“He died unto sin” (that is, with regard to the body), “but liveth unto God758” (that is, with
regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted
death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; “He made Him
to be sin for us, Who knew no sin759,” giving once more the name of “sin” to the flesh.</p>

<head>§2. Then he again mentions S. Peter’s word, “made,” and the passage in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, which says that Jesus was made by God “an Apostle and High Priest”: and, after
giving a sufficient answer to the charges brought against him by Eunomius, shows that
Eunomius himself supports Basil’s arguments, and says that the Only-begotten Son, when
He had put on the flesh, became Lord.</head>
<p>And although we make these remarks in passing, the parenthetic addition seems, perhaps,
not less important than the main question before us. For since, when St. Peter says, “He
made Him Lord and Christ760,” and again, when the Apostle Paul says to the Hebrews that
He made Him a priest761, Eunomius catches at the word “made” as being applicable to His
pre-temporal existence, and thinks thereby to establish his doctrine that the Lord is a thing
made762, let him now listen to Paul when he says, “He made Him to be sin for us, Who
knew not sin763.” If he refers the word “made,” which is used of the Lord in the passages
from the Epistle to the Hebrews, and from the words of Peter, to the pretemporal idea, he
might fairly refer the word in that passage which says that God made Him to be sin, to the
first existence of His essence, and try to show by this, as in the case of his other testimonies,
that he was “made”, so as to refer the word “made” to the essence, acting consistently with
himself, and to discern sin in that essence. But if he shrinks from this by reason of its
manifest absurdity, and argues that, by saying, “He made Him to be sin,” the Apostle indicates
the dispensation of the last times, let him persuade himself by the same train of reasoning
that the word “made” refers to that dispensation in the other passages also.</p>
<p>Let us, however, return to the point from which we digressed; for we might gather together
from the same Scripture countless other passages, besides those quoted, which bear
upon the matter. And let no one think that the divine Apostle is divided against himself in
contradiction, and affords by his own utterances matter for their contentions on either side
to those who dispute upon the doctrines. For careful examination would find that his argument
is accurately directed to one aim; and he is not halting in his opinions: for while he
everywhere proclaims the combination of the Human with the Divine, he none the less
discerns in each its proper nature, in the sense that while the human weakness is changed
for the better by its communion with the imperishable, the Divine power, on the other hand,
is not abased by its contact with the lowly form of nature. When therefore he says, “He
spared not His own Son,” he contrasts the true Son with the other sons, begotten, or exalted,

or adopted764 (those, I mean, who were brought into being at His command), marking the
specialty of nature by the addition of “own.” And, to the end that no one should connect
the suffering of the Cross with the imperishable nature, he gives in other words a fairly distinct
correction of such an error, when he calls Him “mediator between God and men765”
and “man766,” and “God767,” that, from the fact that both are predicated of the one Being,
the fit conception might be entertained concerning each Nature—concerning the Divine
Nature, impassibility, concerning the Human Nature, the dispensation of the Passion. As
his thought, then, divides that which in love to man was made one, but is distinguished in
idea, he uses, when he is proclaiming that nature which transcends and surpasses all intelligence,
the more exalted order of names, calling Him “God over all768,” “the great God769,”
“the power” of God, and “the wisdom” of God770, and the like; but when he is alluding to
all that experience of suffering which, by reason of our weakness, was necessarily assumed
with our nature, he gives to the union of the Natures771 that name which is derived from
ours, and calls Him Man, not by this word placing Him Whom he is setting forth to us on
a common level with the rest of nature, but so that orthodoxy is protected as regards each
Nature, in the sense that the Human Nature is glorified by His assumption of it, and the
Divine is not polluted by Its condescension, but makes the Human element subject to sufferings,
while working, through Its Divine power, the resurrection of that which suffered.
And thus the experience of death is not772 referred to Him Who had communion in our
passible nature by reason of the union with Him of the Man, while at the same time the exalted
and Divine names descend to the Man, so that He Who was manifested upon the Cross
is called even “the Lord of glory773,” since the majesty implied in these names is transmitted

from the Divine to the Human by the commixture of Its Nature with that Nature which is
lowly. For this cause he describes Him in varied and different language, at one time as Him
Who came down from heaven, at another time as Him Who was born of woman, as God
from eternity, and Man in the last days; thus too the Only-begotten God is held to be impassible,
and Christ to be capable of suffering; nor does his discourse speak falsely in these
opposing statements, as it adapts in its conceptions to each Nature the terms that belong to
it. If then these are the doctrines which we have learnt from inspired teaching, how do we
refer the cause of our salvation to an ordinary man? and if we declare the word “made”
employed by the blessed Peter to have regard not to the pre-temporal existence, but to the
new dispensation of the Incarnation, what has this to do with the charge against us? For
this great Apostle says that that which was seen in the form of the servant has been made,
by being assumed, to be that which He Who assumed it was in His own Nature. Moreover,
in the Epistle to the Hebrews we may learn the same truth from Paul, when he says that Jesus
was made an Apostle and High Priest by God, “being faithful to him that made Him so774.”
For in that passage too, in giving the name of High Priest to Him Who made with His own
Blood the priestly propitiation for our sins, he does not by the word “made” declare the first
existence of the Only-begotten, but says “made” with the intention of representing that
grace which is commonly spoken of in connection with the appointment of priests. For Jesus,
the great High Priest (as Zechariah says775), Who offered up his own lamb, that is, His own
Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the children that are partakers of flesh and
blood, Himself also in like manner took part with them in blood776 (not in that He was in
the beginning, being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with God,
but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and offered an oblation and sacrifice
for us), He, I say, became a High Priest many generations later, after the order of
Melchisedech777. Surely a reader who has more than a casual acquaintance with the discourse
to the Hebrews knows the mystery of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have
been made Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and Christ,—the
latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the change and transformation of
the Human to the Divine (for by “making” the Apostle means “making anew”). Thus is
manifest the knavery of our adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the
dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn from the Apostle not
to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as Paul thus speaks, “Yea, though we
have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we Him no more778,” in the sense that the

one knowledge manifests to us His temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence.
Thus our discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:—that we neither
hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the Cross, that we do not glorify
a mere man as having suffered for the world, that we assuredly do not think that the
word “made” refers to the formation of the essence. But, such being our view, our argument
has no small support from our accuser himself, where in the midst of his discourse he employs
his tongue in a flourishing onslaught upon us, and produces this sentence among others:
“This, then, is the conflict that Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither
to have ‘applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles,’ nor to be able to preserve
the sequence of his own arguments; for according to them he must, if he is conscious of
their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God
became Lord,” or he fits together “statements that are mutually conflicting.” Why, this is
actually our statement which Eunomius repeats, who says that “the Word that was in the
beginning and was God became Lord.” For, being what He was, God, and Word, and Life,
and Light, and Grace, and Truth, and Lord, and Christ, and every name exalted and Divine,
He did become, in the Man assumed by Him, Who was none of these, all else which the
Word was and among the rest did become Lord and Christ, according to the teaching of
Peter, and according to the confession of Eunomius;—not in the sense that the Godhead
acquired anything by way of advancement, but (all exalted majesty being contemplated in
the Divine Nature) He thus becomes Lord and Christ, not by arriving at any addition of
grace in respect of His Godhead (for the Nature of the Godhead is acknowledged to be
lacking in no good), but by bringing the Human Nature to that participation in the Godhead
which is signified by the terms “Christ” and “Lord.”</p>

<head>§3. He then gives a notable explanation of the saying of the Lord to Philip, “He that hath seen
Me hath seen the Father;” and herein he excellently discusses the suffering of the Lord in
His love to man, and the impassibility, creative power, and providence of the Father, and
the composite nature of men, and their resolution into the elements of which they were
composed.</head>
<p>Sufficient defence has been offered on these points, and as for that which Eunomius
says by way of calumny against our doctrine, that “Christ was emptied to become Himself”
there has been sufficient discussion in what has been said above, where he has been shown
to be attributing to our doctrine his own blasphemy.779 For it is not one who confesses that
the immutable Nature has put on the created and perishable, who speaks of the transition
from like to like, but one who conceives that there is no change from the majesty of Nature
to that which is more lowly. For if, as their doctrine asserts, He is created, and man is created
also, the wonder of the doctrine disappears, and there is nothing marvellous in what is alleged,
since the created nature comes to be in itself780. But we who have learnt from prophecy of
“the change of the right hand of the Most High781,”—and by the “Right Hand” of the
Father we understand that Power of God, which made all things, which is the Lord (not in
the sense of depending upon Him as a part upon a whole, but as being indeed from Him,
and yet contemplated in individual existence),—say thus: that neither does the Right Hand
vary from Him Whose Right Hand It is, in regard to the idea of Its Nature, nor can any
other change in It be spoken of besides the dispensation of the Flesh. For verily the Right
Hand of God was God Himself; manifested in the flesh, seen through that same flesh by
those whose sight was clear; as He did the work of the Father, being, both in fact and in
thought, the Right Hand of God, yet being changed, in respect of the veil of the flesh by
which He was surrounded, as regarded that which was seen, from that which He was by
Nature, as a subject of contemplation. Therefore He says to Philip, who was gazing only at
that which was changed, “Look through that which is changed to that which is unchangeable,
and if thou seest this, thou hast seen that Father Himself, Whom thou seekest to see; for he
that hath seen Me—not Him Who appears in a state of change, but My very self, Who am
in the Father—will have seen that Father Himself in Whom I am, because the very same
character of Godhead is beheld in both782.” If, then, we believe that the immortal and impassible
and uncreated Nature came to be in the passible Nature of the creature, and conceive
the “change” to consist in this, on what grounds are we charged with saying that He “was

emptied to become Himself,” by those who keep prating their own statements about our
doctrines? For the participation of the created with the created is no “change of the Right
Hand.” To say that the Right Hand of the uncreated Nature is created belongs to Eunomius
alone, and to those who adopt such opinions as he holds. For the man with an eye that looks
on the truth will discern the Right Hand of the Highest to be such as he sees the Highest to
be,—Uncreated of Uncreated, Good of Good, Eternal of Eternal without prejudice to Its
eternity by Its being in the Father by way of generation. Thus our accuser has unawares
been employing against us reproaches that properly fall upon himself.</p>
<p>But with reference783 to those who stumble at the idea of “passion,” and on this ground
maintain the diversity of the Essences,—arguing that the Father, by reason of the exaltation
of His Nature, does not admit passion, and that the Son on the other hand condescended,
by reason of defect and divergence, to the partaking of His sufferings,—I wish to add these
remarks to what has been already said:—That nothing is truly “passion” which does not
tend to sin, nor would one strictly call by the name of “passion” the necessary routine of
nature, regarding the composite nature as it goes on its course in a kind of order and sequence.
For the mutual concurrence of heterogeneous elements in the formation of our
body is a kind of a combination harmoniously conjoined out of several dissimilar elements;
but when, at the due time, the tie is loosed which bound together this concurrence of the
elements, the combined nature is once more dissolved into the elements of which it was
composed. This then is rather a work than a passion of the nature784. For we give the name
of “passion” only to that which is opposed to the virtuous unimpassioned state and of this
we believe that He Who granted us salvation was at all times devoid, Who “was in all points
tempted like as we are yet without sin785.” Of that, at least, which is truly passion, which is
a diseased condition of the will, He was not a partaker; for it says “He did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth786”; but the peculiar attributes of our nature, which, by a kind
of customary abuse of terms, are called by the same name of “passion,”—of these, we confess,
the Lord did partake,—of birth, nourishment, growth, of sleep and toil, and all those natural
dispositions which the soul is wont to experience with regard to bodily inconveniences,—the
<note type="footnote">783 Oehler’s punctuation, while it does not exactly follow that of the earlier editions, still seems to admit of
emendation here.</note>
<note type="footnote">784 The word πάθος, like the English word “passion,” has a double sense: in one sense it connotes a tendency
to evil action or evil habit—and in this sense Christ was not subject to passion. In another sense it has no such
connotation, and it is in this sense (a sense, Gregory would say, somewhat inexact), that the term is used to express
the sufferings of Christ:—to this case, it may be said, the inexact use of the English word is for the most part
restricted.</note>

desire of that which is lacking, when the longing passes from the body to the soul, the sense
of pain, the dread of death, and all the like, save only such as, if followed, lead to sin. As,
then, when we perceive His power extending through all things in heaven, and air, and
earth, and sea, whatever there is in heaven, whatever there is beneath the earth, we believe
that He is universally present, and yet do not say that He is any of those things in which He
is (for He is not the Heaven, Who has marked it out with His enfolding span, nor is He the
earth, Who upholds the circle of the earth, nor yet is He the water, Who encompasses the
liquid nature), so neither do we say that in passing through those sufferings of the flesh of
which we speak He was “subject to passion,” but, as we say that He is the cause of all things
that are, that He holds the universe in His grasp, that He directs all that is in motion and
keeps upon a settled foundation all that is stationary, by the unspeakable power of His own
majesty, so we say that He was born among us for the cure of the disease of sin, adapting
the exercise of His healing power in a manner corresponding to the suffering, applying the
healing in that way which He knew to be for the good of that part of the creation which He
knew to be in infirmity. And as it was expedient that He should heal the sufferings by touch,
we say that He so healed it; yet is He not, because He is the Healer of our infirmity, to be
deemed on this account to have been Himself passible. For even in the case of men, ordinary
use does not allow us to affirm such a thing. We do not say that one who touches a sick man
to heal him is himself partaker of the infirmity, but we say that he does give the sick man
the boon of a return to health, and does not partake of the infirmity: for the suffering does
not touch him, it is he who touches the disease. Now if he who by his art works any good
in men’s bodies is not called dull or feeble, but is called a lover of men and a benefactor and
the like, why do they slander the dispensation to usward as being mean and inglorious, and
use it to maintain that the essence of the Son is “divergent by way of inferiority,” on the
ground that the Nature of the Father is superior to sufferings, while that of the Son is not
pure from passion? Why, if the aim of the dispensation of the Incarnation was not that the
Son should be subject to suffering, but that He should be manifested as a lover of men, while
the Father also is undoubtedly a lover of men, it follows that if one will but regard the aim,
the Son is in the same case with the Father. But if it was not the Father Who wrought the
destruction of death, marvel not,—for all judgment also He hath committed unto the Son,
Himself judging no man787; not doing all things by the Son for the reason that He is unable
either to save the lost or judge the sinner, but because He does these things too by His own
Power, by which He works all things. Then they who were saved by the Son were saved by
<note type="footnote">787 Cf. S. John v. 22</note>

<pb n="359"/>
the Power of the Father, and they who are judged by Him undergo judgment by the Righteousness
of God. For “Christ,” as the Apostle says, “is the Righteousness of God788,” which
is revealed by the Gospel; and whether you look at the world as a whole, or at the parts of
the world which make up that complete whole, all these are works of the Father, in that they
are works of His Power; and thus the word which says both that the Father made all things,
and that none of these things that are came into being without the Son, speaks truly on both
points; for the operation of the Power bears relation to Him Whose Power It is. Thus, since
the Son is the Power of the Father, all the works of the Son are works of the Father. That He
entered upon the dispensation of the Passion not by weakness of nature but by the power
of His will, one might bring countless passages of the Gospel to show; but these, as the
matter is clear, I will pretermit, that my discourse may not be prolonged by dwelling on
points that are admitted. If, then, that which comes to pass is evil, we have to separate from
that evil not the Father only, but the Son also; but if the saving of them that were lost is good,
and if that which took place is not “passion789,” but love of men, why do you alienate from
our thanksgiving for our salvation the Father, Who by His own Power, which is Christ,
wrought for men their freedom from death?</p>
<note type="footnote">788 Rom. i. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">789 That is, “passion” in the sense defined above, as something with evil tendency. If the γινόμενον (i.e. the

and if, therefore, the means (the actual events) are not “passion” as not tending to evil, while, considered in regard
to their aim, they are φιλανθρωπία, then there is no reason why a share in their fulfilment should be denied to
the Father, Who, as well as the Son, is φιλάνθρωπος, and Who by His own Power (that is, by Christ) wrought

<head>§4. Then returning to the words of Peter, “God made Him Lord and Christ,” he skilfully explains
it by many arguments, and herein shows Eunomius as an advocate of the orthodox doctrine,
and concludes the book by showing that the Divine and Human names are applied,
by reason of the commixture, to either Nature.</head>
<p>But we must return once more to our vehement writer of speeches, and take up again
that severe invective of his against ourselves. He makes it a complaint against us that we
deny that the Essence of the Son has been made, as contradicting the words of Peter, “He
made Him Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified790”; and he is very forcible in his
indignation and abuse upon this matter, and moreover maintains certain points by which
he thinks that he refutes our doctrine. Let us see, then, the force of his attempts. “Who, pray,
ye most reckless of men,” he says, “when he has the form of a servant, takes the form of a
servant?” “No reasonable man,” shall be our reply to him, “would use language of this kind,
save such as may be entirely alien from the hope of Christians. But to this class you belong,
who charge us with recklessness because we do not admit the Creator to be created. For if
the Holy Spirit does not lie, when He says by the prophet, ‘All things serve Thee791,’ and
the whole creation is in servitude, and the Son is, as you say792, created, He is clearly a fellowservant
with all things, being degraded by His partaking of creation to partake also of servitude.
And Him Who is in servitude you will surely invest with the servant’s form: for you
will not, of course, be ashamed of the aspect of servitude when you acknowledge that He is
a servant by nature. Who now is it, I pray, my most keen rhetorician, who transfers the Son
from the servile form to another form of a servant? he who claims for Him uncreated being,
and thereby proves that He is no servant, or you, rather, who continually cry that the Son
is the servant of the Father, and was actually under His dominion before He took the servant’s
form? I ask for no other judges; I leave the vote on these questions in your own hands. For
I suppose that no one is so shameless in his dealings with the truth as to oppose acknowledged
facts out of sheer impudence. What we have said is clear to any one, that by the peculiar
attributes of servitude is marked that which is by nature servile, and to be created is an attribute
proper to servitude. Thus one who asserts that He, being a servant, took upon Him
our form, is surely the man who transfers the Only-begotten from servitude to servitude.”</p>
<p>He tries, however, to fight against our words, and says, a little further on (for I will pass
over at present his intermediate remarks, as they have been more or less fully discussed in
my previous arguments), when he charges us with being “bold in saying or thinking things

uncontrivable,” and calls us “most miserable793,”—he adds, I say, this:—“For if it is not of
the Word Who was in the beginning and was God that the blessed Peter speaks, but of Him
Who was ‘seen,’ and Who ‘emptied Himself,’ as Basil says, and if the man Who was ‘seen’
‘emptied Himself’ to take ‘the form of a servant,’ and He Who ‘emptied Himself’ to take the
form of a servant,’ ‘emptied Himself’ to come into being as man, then the man who was
‘seen’ ‘emptied himself,’ to come into being as man.” It may be that the judgment of my
readers has immediately detected from the above citation the knavery, and, at the same
time, the folly of the argument he maintains: yet a brief refutation of what he says shall be
subjoined on our side, not so much to overthrow his blundering sophism, which indeed is
overthrown by itself for those who have ears to hear, as to avoid the appearance of passing
his allegation by without discussion, under the pretence of contempt for the worthlessness
of his argument. Let us accordingly look at the point in this way. What are the Apostle’s
words? “Be it known,” he says, “that God made Him Lord and Christ794.” Then, as though
some one had asked him on whom such a grace was bestowed, he points as it were with his
finger to the subject, saying, “this Jesus, Whom ye crucified.” What does Basil say upon this?
That the demonstrative word declares that that person was made Christ, Who had been
crucified by the hearers;—for he says, “ye crucified,” and it was likely that those who had
demanded the murder that was done upon Him were hearers of the speech; for the time
from the crucifixion to the discourse of Peter was not long. What, then, does Eunomius
advance in answer to this? “If it is not of the Word Who was in the beginning and was God
that the blessed Peter speaks, but of Him Who was ‘seen,’ and Who ‘emptied Himself,’ as
Basil says, and if the man who was ‘seen’ ‘emptied himself’ to take ‘the form of a servant’”—
Hold! who says this, that the man who was seen emptied himself again to take the
form of a servant? or who maintains that the suffering of the Cross took place before the
manifestation in the flesh? The Cross did not precede the body, nor the body “the form of
the servant.” But God is manifested in the flesh, while the flesh that displayed God in itself,
after having by itself fulfilled the great mystery of the Death, is transformed by commixture
to that which is exalted and Divine, becoming Christ and Lord, being transferred and changed
to that which He was, Who manifested Himself in that flesh. But if we should say this, our
champion of the truth maintains once more that we say that He Who was shown upon the
Cross “emptied Himself” to become another man, putting his sophism together as follows
in its wording:—“If,” quoth he, “the man who was ‘seen’ ‘emptied himself’ to take the ‘form
of a servant,’ and He Who ‘emptied Himself’ to take the ‘form of a servant,’ ‘emptied Himself’
to come into being as man, then the man who was ‘seen’ ‘emptied himself’ to come into
being as man.”</p>
<note type="footnote">793 Oehler’s punctuation here seems to require correction.</note>
<note type="footnote">794 Acts ii. 36.</note>

<pb n="362"/>
<p>How well he remembers the task before him! how much to the point is the conclusion
of his argument! Basil declares that the Apostle said that the man who was “seen” was made
Christ and Lord, and this clear and quick-witted over-turner of his statements says, “If Peter
does not say that the essence of Him Who was in the beginning was made, the man who
was ‘seen’ ‘emptied himself’ to take the ‘form of a servant,’ and He Who ‘emptied Himself’
to take the ’form of a servant, emptied Himself to become man.” We are conquered, Eunomius,
by this invincible wisdom! The fact that the Apostle’s discourse refers to Him Who
was “crucified through weakness795” is forsooth powerfully disproved when we learn that
if we believe this to be so, the man who was “seen” again becomes another, “emptying
Himself” for another coming into being of man. Will you never cease jesting against what
should be secure from such attempts? will you not blush at destroying by such ridiculous
sophisms the awe that hedges the Divine mysteries? will you not turn now, if never before,
to know that the Only-begotten God, Who is in the bosom of the Father, being Word, and
King, and Lord, and all that is exalted in word and thought, needs not to become anything
that is good, seeing that He is Himself the fulness of all good things? What then is that, by
changing into which He becomes what He was not before? Well, as He Who knew not sin
becomes sin796, that He may take away the sin of the world, so on the other hand the flesh
which received the Lord becomes Christ and Lord, being transformed by the commixture
into that which it was not by nature: whereby we learn that neither would God have been
manifested in the flesh, had not the Word been made flesh, nor would the human flesh that
compassed Him about have been transformed to what is Divine, had not that which was
apparent to the senses become Christ and Lord. But they treat the simplicity of what we
preach with contempt, who use their syllogisms to trample on the being of God, and desire
to show that He Who by creation brought into being all things that are, is Himself a part of
creation, and wrest, to assist them in such an effort to establish their blasphemy, the words
of Peter, who said to the Jews, “Be it known to all the house of Israel that God made Him
Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified797.” This is the proof they present for the
statement that the essence of the Only-begotten God is created! What? tell me, were the
Jews, to whom the words were spoken, in existence before the ages? was the Cross before
the world? was Pilate before all creation? was Jesus in existence first, and after that the Word?
was the flesh more ancient than the Godhead? did Gabriel bring glad tidings to Mary before
the world was? did not the Man that was in Christ take beginning by way of birth in the
days of Cæsar Augustus, while the Word that was God in the beginning is our King, as the

<pb n="363"/>
prophet testifies, before all ages798? See you not what confusion you bring upon the matter,
turning, as the phrase goes, things upside down? It was the fiftieth day after the Passion,
when Peter preached his sermon to the Jews and said, “Him Whom ye crucified, God made
Christ and Lord.” Do you not mark the order of his saying? which stands first, which second
in his words? He did not say, “Him Whom God made Lord, ye crucified,” but, “Whom ye
crucified, Him God made Christ and Lord”: so that it is clear from this that Peter is speaking,
not of what was before the ages, but of what was after the dispensation.</p>
<p>How comes it, then, that you fail to see that the whole conception of your argument on
the subject is being overthrown, and go on making yourself ridiculous with your childish
web of sophistry, saying that, if we believe that He who was apparent to the senses has been
made by God to be Christ and Lord, it necessarily follows that the Lord once more “emptied
Himself” anew to become Man, and underwent a second birth? What advantage does your
doctrine get from this? How does what you say show the King of creation to be created? For
my own part I assert on the other side that our view is supported by those who contend
against us, and that the rhetorician, in his exceeding attention to the matter, has failed to
see that in pushing, as he supposed, the argument to an absurdity, he is fighting on the side
of those whom he attacks, with the very weapons he uses for their overthrow. For if we are
to believe that the change of condition in the case of Jesus was from a lofty state to a lowly
one, and if the Divine and uncreated Nature alone transcends the creation, he will, perhaps,
when he thoroughly surveys his own argument, come over to the ranks of truth, and agree
that the Uncreated came to be in the created, in His love for man. But if he imagines that
he demonstrates the created character of the Lord by showing that He, being God, took part
in human nature, he will find many such passages to establish the same opinion which carry
out their support of his argument in a similar way. For since He was the Word and was God,
and “afterwards,” as the prophet says, “was seen upon earth and conversed with men799,”
He will hereby be proved to be one of the creatures! And if this is held to be beside the
question, similar passages too are not quite akin to the subject. For in sense it is just the
same to say that the Word that was in the beginning was manifested to men through the
flesh, and to say that being in the form of God He put on the form of a servant: and if one
of these statements gives no help for the establishment of his blasphemy, he must needs give
up the remaining one also. He is kind enough, however, to advise us to abandon our error,
and to point out the truth which He himself maintains. He tells us that the Apostle Peter
declares Him to have been made Who was in the beginning the Word and God. Well, if he
were making up dreams for our amusement, and giving us information about the prophetic
interpretation of the visions of sleep, there might be no risk in allowing him to set forth the
<note type="footnote">798 Ps. lxxiv. 12 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">799 Bar. iii. 37.</note>

<pb n="364"/>
riddles of his imagination at his pleasure. But when he tells us that he is explaining the Divine
utterances, it is no longer safe for us to leave him to interpret the words as he likes. What
does the Scripture say? “God made Lord and Christ this Jesus whom ye crucified800.” When
everything, then, is found to concur—the demonstrative word denoting Him Who is spoken
of by the Name of His Humanity, the charge against those who were stained with bloodguiltiness,
the suffering of the Cross—our thought necessarily turns to that which was apparent
to the senses. But he asserts that while Peter uses these words it is the pretemporal
existence that is indicated by the word “made”801. Well, we may safely allow nurses and old
wives to jest with children, and to lay down the meaning of dreams as they choose: but when
inspired Scripture is set before us for exposition, the great Apostle forbids us to have recourse
to old wives’ tattle802. When I hear “the Cross” spoken of, I understand the Cross, and when
I hear mention of a human name, I understand the nature which that name connotes. So
when I hear from Peter that “this” one was made Lord and Christ, I do not doubt that he
speaks of Him Who had been before the eyes of men, since the saints agree with one another
in this matter as well as in others. For, as he says that He Who was crucified has been made
Lord, so Paul also says that He was “highly exalted803,” after the Passion and the Resurrection,
not being exalted in so far forth as He is God. For what height is there more sublime than
the Divine height, that he should say God was exalted thereunto? But he means that the
lowliness of the Humanity was exalted, the word, I suppose, indicating the assimilation and
union of the Man Who was assumed to the exalted state of the Divine Nature. And even if
one were to allow him licence to misinterpret the Divine utterance, not even so will his argument
conclude in accordance with the aim of his heresy. For be it granted that Peter does
say of Him Who was in the beginning, “God made Him Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom
ye crucified,” we shall find that even so his blasphemy does not gain any strength against
the truth. “God made Him,” he says, “Lord and Christ.” To which of the words are we to
refer the word made? with which of those that are employed in this sentence are we to connect
the word? There are three before us:—“this,” and “Lord,” and “Christ.” With which of these
three will he construct the word “made”? No one is so bold against the truth as to deny that
“made” has reference to “Christ” and “Lord”; for Peter says that He, being already whatever
He was, was “made Christ and Lord” by the Father.</p>
<p>These words are not mine: they are those of him who fights against the Word. For he
says, in the very passage that is before us for examination, exactly thus:—“The blessed Peter

speaks of Him Who was in the beginning and was God, and expounds to us that it was He
Who became Lord and Christ.” Eunomius, then, says that He Who was whatsoever He was
became Lord and Christ, as the history of David tells us that he, being the son of Jesse, and
a keeper of the flocks, was anointed to be king: not that the anointing then made him to be
a man, but that he, being what he was by his own nature, was transformed from an ordinary
man to a king. What follows? Is it thereby the more established that the essence of the Son
was made, if, as Eunomius says, God made Him, when He was in the beginning and was
God, both Lord and Christ? For Lordship is not a name of His being but of His being in
authority, and the appellation of Christ indicates His kingdom, while the idea of His kingdom
is one, and that of His Nature another. Suppose that Scripture does say that these things
took place with regard to the Son of God. Let us then consider which is the more pious and
the more rational view. Which can we allowably say is made partaker of superiority by way
of advancement—God or man? Who has so childish a mind as to suppose that the Divinity
passes on to perfection by way of addition? But as to the Human Nature, such a supposition
is not unreasonable, seeing that the words of the Gospel clearly ascribe to our Lord increase
in respect of His Humanity: for it says, “Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favour804.”
Which, then, is the more reasonable suggestion to derive from the Apostle’s words?—that
He Who was God in the beginning became Lord by way of advancement, or that the lowliness
of the Human Nature was raised to the height of majesty as a result of its communion with
the Divine? For the prophet David also, speaking in the person of the Lord, says, “I am established
as king by Him805,” with a meaning very close to “I was made Christ:” and again,
in the person of the Father to the Lord, he says, “Be Thou Lord in the midst of Thine enemies806,”
with the same meaning as Peter, “Be Thou made Lord of Thine enemies.” As,
then, the establishment of His kingdom does not signify the formation of His essence, but
the advance to His dignity, and He Who bids Him “be Lord” does not command that which
is non-existent to come into being at that particular time, but gives to Him Who is the rule
over those who are disobedient,—so also the blessed Peter, when he says that one has been
made Christ (that is, king of all) adds the word “Him” to distinguish the idea both from the
essence and from the attributes contemplated in connection with it. For He made Him what
has been declared when He already was that which He is. Now if it were allowable to assert
of the transcendent Nature that it became anything by way of advancement, as a king from
being an ordinary man, or lofty from being lowly, or Lord from being servant, it might be
proper to apply Peter’s words to the Only-begotten. But since the Divine Nature, whatever
it is believed to be, always remains the same, being above all augmentation and incapable

of diminution, we are absolutely compelled to refer his saying to the Humanity. For God
the Word is now, and always remains, that which He was in the beginning, always King,
always Lord, always God and Most High, not having become any of these things by way of
advancement, but being in virtue of His Nature all that He is declared to be, while on the
other hand He Who was, by being assumed, elevated from Man to the Divinity, being one
thing and becoming another, is strictly and truly said to have become Christ and Lord. For
He made Him to be Lord from being a servant, to be King from being a subject, to be Christ
from being in subordination. He highly exalted that which was lowly, and gave to Him that
had the Human Name that Name which is above every name807. And thus came to pass
that unspeakable mixture and conjunction of human littleness commingled with Divine
greatness, whereby even those names which are great and Divine are properly applied to
the Humanity, while on the other hand the Godhead is spoken of by human names808. For
it is the same Person who both has the Name which is above every name, and is worshipped
by all creation in the human Name of Jesus. For he says, “at the name of Jesus every knee
shall bow, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every
tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father809.” But enough of
these matters.</p>

<head>§1. The seventh book shows from various statements made to the Corinthians and to the
Hebrews, and from the words of the Lord, that the word “Lord” is not expressive of essence,
according to Eunomius’ exposition, but of dignity. and after many notable remarks concerning
“the Spirit” and the Lord, he shows that Eunomius, from his own words, is found
to argue in favour of orthodoxy, though without intending it, and to be struck by his own
shafts.</head>
<p>Since, however, Eunomius asserts that the word “Lord” is used in reference to the essence
and not to the dignity of the Only-begotten, and cites as a witness to this view the Apostle,
when he says to the Corinthians, “Now the Lord is the Spirit810,” it may perhaps be opportune
that we should not pass over even this error on his part without correction. He asserts that
the word “Lord” is significative of essence, and by way of proof of this assumption he brings
up the passage above mentioned. “The Lord,” it says, “is the Spirit811.” But our friend who
interprets Scripture at his own sweet will calls “Lordship” by the name of “essence,” and
thinks to bring his statement to proof by means of the words quoted. Well, if it had been
said by Paul, “Now the Lord is essence,” we too would have concurred in his argument. But
seeing that the inspired writing on the one side says, “the Lord is the Spirit,” and Eunomius
says on the other, “Lordship is essence,” I do not know where he finds support for his
statement, unless he is prepared to say again812 that the word “Spirit” stands in Scripture
for “essence.” Let us consider, then, whether the Apostle anywhere, in his use of the term
“Spirit,” employs that word to indicate “essence.” He says, “The Spirit itself beareth witness
with our Spirit813,” and “no one knoweth the things of a man save the Spirit of man which
is in him814,” and “the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life815,” and “if ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live816,” and “if we live in the Spirit let us
also walk in the Spirit817.” Who indeed could count the utterances of the Apostle on this
point? and in them we nowhere find “essence” signified by this word. For he who says that
“the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,” signifies nothing else than the Holy Spirit

Which comes to be in the mind of the faithful; for in many other passages of his writings
he gives the name of spirit to the mind, on the reception by which of the communion of the
Spirit the recipients attain the dignity of adoption. Again, in the passage, “No one knoweth
the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,” if “man” is used of the essence,
and “spirit” likewise, it will follow from the phrase that the man is maintained to be of two
essences. Again, I know not how he who says that “the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
life,” sets “essence” in opposition to “letter”; nor, again, how this writer imagines that when
Paul says that we ought “through the Spirit” to destroy “the deeds of the body,” he is directing
the signification of “spirit” to express “essence”; while as for “living in the Spirit,” and
“walking in the Spirit,” this would be quite unintelligible if the sense of the word “Spirit”
referred to “essence.” For in what else than in essence do all we who are alive partake of
life?—thus when the Apostle is laying down advice for us on this matter that we should “live
in essence,” it is as though he said “partake of life by means of yourselves, and not by means
of others.” If then it is not possible that this sense can be adopted in any passage, how can
Eunomius here once more imitate the interpreters of dreams, and bid us to take “spirit” for
“essence,” to the end that he may arrive in due syllogistic form at his conclusion that the
word “Lord” is applied to the essence?—for if “spirit” is “essence” (he argues), and “the Lord
is Spirit,” the “Lord” is clearly found to be “essence.” How incontestable is the force of this
attempt! How can we evade or resolve this irrefragable necessity of demonstration? The
word “Lord,” he says, is spoken of the essence. How does he maintain it? Because the Apostle
says, “The Lord is the Spirit.” Well, what has this to do with essence? He gives us the further
instruction that “spirit” is put for “essence.” These are the arts of his demonstrative method!
These are the results of his Aristotelian science! This is why, in your view, we are so much
to be pitied, who are uninitiated in this wisdom! and you of course are to be deemed happy,
who track out the truth by a method like this—that the Apostle’s meaning was such that we
are to suppose “the Spirit” was put by him for the Essence of the Only-begotten!</p>
<p>Then how will you make it fit with what follows? For when Paul says, “Now the Lord
is the Spirit,” he goes on to say, “and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” If then
“the Lord is the Spirit,” and “Spirit” means “essence,” what are we to understand by “the
essence of the essence”? He speaks again of another Spirit of the Lord Who is the Spirit,—that
is to say, according to your interpretation, of another essence. Therefore in your view the
Apostle, when he writes expressly of “the Lord the Spirit,” and of “the Spirit of the Lord,”
means nothing else than an essence of an essence. Well, let Eunomius make what he likes
of that which is written; what we understand of the matter is as follows. The Scripture,
“given by inspiration of God,” as the Apostle calls it, is the Scripture of the Holy Spirit, and
its intention is the profit of men. For “every scripture,” he says, “is given by inspiration of
God and is profitable”; and the profit is varied and multiform, as the Apostle says—“for

doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness818.” Such a boon as
this, however, is not within any man’s reach to lay hold of, but the Divine intention lies hid
under the body of the Scripture, as it were under a veil, some legislative enactment or some
historical narrative being cast over the truths that are contemplated by the mind. For this
reason, then, the Apostle tells us that those who look upon the body of the Scripture have
“a veil upon their heart819,” and are not able to look upon the glory of the spiritual law, being
hindered by the veil that has been cast over the face of the law-giver. Wherefore he says,
“the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,” showing that often the obvious interpretation,
if it be not taken according to the proper sense, has an effect contrary to that life which is
indicated by the Spirit, seeing that this lays down for all men the perfection of virtue in
freedom from passion, while the history contained in the writings sometimes embraces the
exposition even of facts incongruous, and is understood, so to say, to concur with the passions
of our nature, whereto if any one applies himself according to the obvious sense, he will
make the Scripture a doctrine of death. Accordingly, he says that over the perceptive powers
of the souls of men who handle what is written in too corporeal a manner, the veil is cast;
but for those who turn their contemplation to that which is the object of the intelligence,
there is revealed, bared, as it were, of a mask, the glory that underlies the letter. And that
which is discovered by this more exalted perception he says is the Lord, which is the Spirit.
For he says, “when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away: now the Lord is the
Spirit820.” And in so saying he makes a distinction of contrast between the lordship of the
spirit and the bondage of the letter; for as that which gives life is opposed to that which kills,
so he contrasts “the Lord” with bondage. And that we may not be under any confusion when
we are instructed concerning the Holy Spirit (being led by the word “Lord” to the thought
of the Only-begotten), for this reason he guards the word by repetition, both saying that
“the Lord is the Spirit,” and making further mention of “the Spirit of the Lord,” that the
supremacy of His Nature may be shown by the honour implied in lordship, while at the
same time he may avoid confusing in his argument the individuality of His Person. For he
who calls Him both “Lord” and “Spirit of the Lord,” teaches us to conceive of Him as a
separate individual besides the Only-begotten; just as elsewhere he speaks of “the Spirit of
Christ821,” employing fairly and in its mystic sense this very term which is piously employed
in the system of doctrine according to the Gospel tradition. Thus we, the “most miserable
of all men,” being led onward by the Apostle in the mysteries, pass from the letter that killeth
to the Spirit that giveth life, learning from Him Who was in Paradise initiated into the un-

speakable mysteries, that all things the Divine Scripture says are utterances of the Holy
Spirit. For “well did the Holy Spirit prophesy822,”—this he says to the Jews in Rome, introducing
the words of Isaiah; and to the Hebrews, alleging the authority of the Holy Spirit in
the words, “wherefore as saith the Holy Spirit823,” he adduces the words of the Psalm which
are spoken at length in the person of God; and from the Lord Himself we learn the same
thing,—that David declared the heavenly mysteries not “in” himself (that is, not speaking
according to human nature). For how could any one, being but man, know the supercelestial
converse of the Father with the Son? But being “in the Spirit” he said that the Lord spoke
to the Lord those words which He has uttered. For if, He says, “David in the Spirit calls him
Lord, how is He then his son824?” Thus it is by the power of the Spirit that the holy men
who are under Divine influence are inspired, and every Scripture is for this reason said to
be “given by inspiration of God,” because it is the teaching of the Divine afflatus. If the
bodily veil of the words were removed, that which remains is Lord and life and Spirit, according
to the teaching of the great Paul, and according to the words of the Gospel also. For
Paul declares that he who turns from the letter to the Spirit no longer apprehends the
bondage that slays, but the Lord which is the life-giving Spirit; and the sublime Gospel says,
“the words that I speak are spirit and are life825,” as being divested of the bodily veil. The
idea, however, that “the Spirit” is the essence of the Only-begotten, we shall leave to our
dreamers: or rather, we shall make use, ex abundanti, of what they say, and arm the truth
with the weapons of the adversary. For it is allowable that the Egyptian should be spoiled
by the Israelites, and that we should make their wealth an ornament for ourselves. If the
essence of the Son is called “Spirit,” and God also is Spirit, (for so the Gospel tells us826),
clearly the essence of the Father is called “Spirit” also. But if it is their peculiar argument
that things which are introduced by different names are different also in nature, the conclusion
surely is, that things which are named alike are not alien one from the other in nature
either. Since then, according to their account, the essence of the Father and that of the Son
are both called “Spirit,” hereby is clearly proved the absence of any difference in essence.
For a little further on Eunomius says:—“Of those essences which are divergent the appellations
significant of essence are also surely divergent, but where there is one and the same
name, that which is declared by the same appellation will surely be one also”:—so that at all
points “He that taketh the wise in their own craftiness827” has turned the long labours of

our author, and the infinite toil spent on what he has elaborated, to the establishment of the
doctrine which we maintain. For if God is in the Gospel called “Spirit,” and the essence of
the Only-begotten is maintained by Eunomius to be “Spirit,” as there is no apparent difference
in the one name as compared with the other, neither, surely, will the things signified by the
names be mutually different in nature.</p>
<p>And now that I have exposed this futile and pointless sham-argument, it seems to me
that I may well pass by without discussion what he next puts together by way of attack upon
our master’s statement. For a sufficient proof of the folly of his remarks is to be found in
his actual argument, which of itself proclaims aloud its feebleness. To be entangled in a
contest with such things as this is like trampling on the slain. For when he sets forth with
much confidence some passage from our master, and treats it with preliminary slander and
contempt, and promises that he will show it to be worth nothing at all, he meets with the
same fortune as befalls small children, to whom their imperfect and immature intelligence,
and the untrained condition of their perceptive faculties, do not give an accurate understanding
of what they see. Thus they often imagine that the stars are but a little way above their
heads, and pelt them with clods when they appear, in their childish folly; and then, when
the clod falls, they clap their hands and laugh and brag to their comrades as if their throw
had reached the stars themselves. Such is the man who casts at the truth with his childish
missile, who sets forth like the stars those splendid sayings of our master, and then hurls
from the ground,—from his downtrodden and grovelling understanding,—his earthy and
unstable arguments. And these, when they have gone so high that they have no place to fall
from, turn back again of themselves by their own weight828. Now the passage of the great
Basil is worded as follows829:—</p>
<p>“Yet what sane man would agree with the statement that of those things of which the
names are different the essences must needs be divergent also? For the appellations of Peter
and Paul, and, generally speaking, of men, are different, while the essence of all is one:
wherefore, in most respects we are mutually identical, and differ one from another only in
those special properties which are observed in individuals: and hence also appellations are
not indicative of essence, but of the properties which mark the particular individual. Thus,
when we hear of Peter, we do not by the name understand the essence (and by ‘essence’ I
here mean the material substratum), but we are impressed with the conception of the
properties which we contemplate in him.” These are the great man’s words. And what skill
he who disputes this statement displays against us, we learn,—any one, that is, who has
leisure for wasting time on unprofitable matters,—from the actual composition of Eunomius.</p>

<p>From his writings, I say, for I do not like to insert in my own work the nauseous stuff
our rhetorician utters, or to display his ignorance and folly to contempt in the midst of my
own arguments. He goes on with a sort of eulogy upon the class of significant words which
express the subject, and, in his accustomed style, patches and sticks together the cast-off
rags of phrases: poor Isocrates is nibbled at once more, and shorn of words and figures to
make out the point proposed,—here and there even the Hebrew Philo receives the same
treatment, and makes him a contribution of phrases from his own labours,—yet not even
thus is this much-stitched and many-coloured web of words finished off, but every assault,
every defence of his conceptions, all his artistic preparation, spontaneously collapses, and,
as commonly happens with the bubbles when the drops, borne down from above through
a body of waters against some obstacle, produce those foamy swellings which, as soon as
they gather, immediately dissolve, and leave upon the water no trace of their own formation—
such are the air-bubbles of our author’s thoughts, vanishing without a touch at the
moment they are put forth. For after all these irrefragable statements, and the dreamy
philosophizing wherein he asserts that the distinct character of the essence is apprehended
by the divergence of names, as some mass of foam borne downstream breaks up when it
comes into contact with any more solid body, so his argument, following its own spontaneous
course, and coming unexpectedly into collision with the truth, disperses into nothingness
its unsubstantial and bubble-like fabric of falsehood. For he speaks in these words:—“Who
is so foolish and so far removed from the constitution of men, as, in discoursing of men to
speak of one as a man, and, calling another a horse, so to compare them?” I would answer
him,—“You are right in calling any one foolish who makes such blunders in the use of
names. And I will employ for the support of the truth the testimony you yourself give. For
if it is a piece of extreme folly to call one a horse and another a man, supposing both were
really men, it is surely a piece of equal stupidity, when the Father is confessed to be God,
and the Son is confessed to be God, to call the one ‘created’ and the other ‘uncreated,’ since,
as in the other case humanity, so in this case the Godhead does not admit a change of name
to that expressive of another kind. For what the irrational is with respect to man, that also
the creature is with respect to the Godhead, being equally unable to receive the same name
with the nature that is superior to it. And as it is not possible to apply the same definition
to the rational animal and the quadruped alike (for each is naturally differentiated by its
special property from the other), so neither can you express by the same terms the created
and the uncreated essence, seeing that those attributes which are predicated of the latter
essence are not discoverable in the former. For as rationality is not discoverable in a horse,
nor solidity of hoofs in a man, so neither is Godhead discoverable in the creature, nor the
attribute of being created in the Godhead: but if He be God He is certainly not created, and
if He be created He is not God; unless830, of course, one were to apply by some misuse or

<pb n="373"/>
customary mode of expression the mere name of Godhead, as some horses have men’s
names given them by their owners; yet neither is the horse a man, though he be called by a
human name, nor is the created being God, even though some claim for him the name of
Godhead, and give him the benefit of the empty sound of a dissyllable.” Since, then, Eunomius’
heretical statement is found spontaneously to fall in with the truth, let him take his
own advice and stand by his own words, and by no means retract his own utterances, but
consider that the man is really foolish and stupid who names the subject not according as
it is, but says “horse” for “man,” and “sea” for “sky,” and “creature” for “God.” And let no
one think it unreasonable that the creature should be set in opposition to God, but have
regard to the prophets and to the Apostles. For the prophet says in the person of the Father,
“My Hand made all these things”831, meaning by “Hand,” in his dark saying, the power of
the Only-begotten. Now the Apostle says that all things are of the Father, and that all things
are by the Son832, and the prophetic spirit in a way agrees with the Apostolic teaching, which
itself also is given through the Spirit. For in the one passage, the prophet, when he says that
all things are the work of the Hand of Him Who is over all, sets forth the nature of those
things which have come into being in its relation to Him Who made them, while He Who
made them is God over all, Who has the Hand, and by It makes all things. And again, in
the other passage, the Apostle makes the same division of entities, making all things depend
upon their productive cause, yet not reckoning in the number of “all things” that which
produces them: so that we are hereby taught the difference of nature between the created
and the uncreated, and it is shown that, in its own nature, that which makes is one thing
and that which is produced is another. Since, then, all things are of God, and the Son is God,
the creation is properly opposed to the Godhead; while, since the Only-begotten is something
else than the nature of the universe (seeing that not even those who fight against the truth
contradict this), it follows of necessity that the Son also is equally opposed to the creation,
unless the words of the saints are untrue which testify that by Him all things were made.</p>

<head>§2. He then declares that the close relation between names and things is immutable, and
thereafter proceeds accordingly, in the most excellent manner, with his discourse concerning
“generated” and “ungenerate.”</head>
<p>Now seeing that the Only-begotten is in the Divine Scriptures proclaimed to be God,
let Eunomius consider his own argument, and condemn for utter folly the man who parts
the Divine into created and uncreated, as he does him who divides “man” into “horse” and
“man.” For he himself says, a little further on, after his intermediate nonsense, “the close
relation of names to things is immutable,” where he himself by this statement assents to the
fixed character of the true connection of appellations with their subject. If, then, the name
of Godhead is properly employed in close connection with the Only-begotten God (and
Eunomius, though he may desire to be out of harmony with us, will surely concede that the
Scripture does not lie, and that the name of the Godhead is not inharmoniously attributed
to the Only-begotten), let him persuade himself by his own reasoning that if “the close relation
of names to things is immutable,” and the Lord is called by the name of “God,” he
cannot apprehend any difference in respect of the conception of Godhead between the
Father and the Son, seeing that this name is common to both,—or rather not this name
only, but there is a long list of names in which the Son shares, without divergence of
meaning, the appellations of the Father,—“good,” “incorruptible,” “just,” “judge,” “longsuffering,”
“merciful,” “eternal,” “everlasting,” all that indicate the expression of majesty of
nature and power,—without any reservation being made in His case in any of the names in
regard of the exalted nature of the conception. But Eunomius passes by, as it were with
closed eye, the number, great as it is, of the Divine appellations, and looks only to one point,
his “generate and ungenerate,”—trusting to a slight and weak cord his doctrine, tossed and
driven as it is by the blasts of error.</p>
<p>He asserts that “no man who has any regard for the truth either calls any generated
thing ‘ungenerate,’ or calls God Who is over all ‘Son’ or ‘generate.’” This statement needs
no further arguments on our part for its refutation. For he does not shelter his craft with
any veils, as his wont is, but treats the inversion of his absurd statement as equivalent833,
while he says that neither is any generated thing spoken of as “ungenerate,” nor is God Who
is over all called “Son” or “generate,” without making any special distinction for the Onlybegotten
Godhead of the Son as compared with the rest of the “generated,” but makes his
opposition of “all things that have come into being” to “God” without discrimination, not
excepting the Son from “all things.” And in the inversion of his absurdities he clearly separ-
<note type="footnote">833 That is, in making a rhetorical inversion of a proposition in itself objectionable, he so re-states it as to
make it really a different proposition while treating it as equivalent. The original proposition is objectionable

for the term “ungenerate.”</note>

<pb n="375"/>
ates, forsooth, the Son from the Divine Nature, when he says that neither is any generated
thing spoken of as “ungenerate,” nor is God called “Son” or “generate,” and manifestly reveals
by this contradistinction the horrid character of his blasphemy. For when he has distinguished
the “things that have come into being” from the “ungenerate,” he goes on to say, in that
antistrophal induction of his, that it is impossible to call (not the “unbegotten,” but) “God,”
“Son” or “generate,” trying by these words to show that which is not ungenerate is not God,
and that the Only-begotten God is, by the fact of being begotten, as far removed from being
God as the ungenerate is from being generated in fact or in name. For it is not in ignorance
of the consequence of his argument that he makes an inversion of the terms employed thus
inharmonious and incongruous: it is in his assault on the doctrine of orthodoxy that he
opposes “the Godhead” to “the generate”—and this is the point he tries to establish by his
words, that that which is not ungenerate is not God. What was the true sequence of his argument?
that having said “no generated thing is ungenerate,” he should proceed with the
inference, “nor, if anything is naturally ungenerate, can it be generate.” Such a statement at
once contains truth and avoids blasphemy. But now by his premise that no generated thing
is ungenerate, and his inference that God is not generated, he clearly shuts out the Onlybegotten
God from being God, laying down that because He is not ungenerate, neither is
He God. Do we then need any further proofs to expose this monstrous blasphemy? Is not
this enough by itself to serve for a record against the adversary of Christ, who by the arguments
cited maintains that the Word, Who in the beginning was God, is not God? What
need is there to engage further with such men as this? For we do not entangle ourselves in
controversy with those who busy themselves with idols and with the blood that is shed upon
their altars, not that we acquiesce in the destruction of those who are besotted about idols,
but because their disease is too strong for our treatment. Thus, just as the fact itself declares
idolatry, and the evil that men do boldly and arrogantly anticipates the reproach of those
who accuse it, so here too I think that the advocates of orthodoxy should keep silence towards
one who openly proclaims his impiety to his own discredit, just as medicine also stands
powerless in the case of a cancerous complaint, because the disease is too strong for the art
to deal with.</p>

<head>§3. Thereafter he discusses the divergence of names and of things, speaking, of that which is
ungenerate as without a cause, and of that which is non-existent, as the Scindapsus,
Minotaur, Blityri, Cyclops, Scylla, which never were generated at all, and shows that
things which are essentially different, are mutually destructive, as fire of water, and the
rest in their several relations. But in the case of the Father and the Son, as the essence is
common, and the properties reciprocally interchangeable, no injury results to the Nature.</head>
<p>Since, however, after the passage cited above, he professes that he will allege something
stronger still, let us examine this also, as well as the passage cited, lest we should seem to be
withdrawing our opposition in face of an overwhelming force. “If, however,” he says, “I am
to abandon all these positions, and fall back upon my stronger argument, I would say this,
that even if all the terms that he advances by way of refutation were established, our statement
will none the less be manifestly shown to be true. If, as will be admitted, the divergence of
the names which are significant of properties marks the divergence of the things, it is surely
necessary to allow that with the divergence of the names significant of essence is also marked
the divergence of the essences. And this would be found to hold good in all cases, I mean
in the case of essences, energies, colours, figures, and other qualities. For we denote by divergent
appellations the different essences, fire and water, air and earth, cold and heat, white
and black, triangle and circle. Why need we mention the intelligible essences, in enumerating
which the Apostle marks, by difference of names, the divergence of essence?”</p>
<p>Who would not be dismayed at this irresistible power of attack? The argument transcends
the promise, the experience is more terrible than the threat. “I will come,” he says, “to my
stronger argument.” What is it? That as the differences of properties are recognized by those
names which signify the special attributes, we must of course, he says, allow that differences
of essence are also expressed by divergence of names. What then are these appellations of
essences by which we learn the divergence of Nature between the Father and the son? He
talks of fire and water, air and earth, cold and heat, white and black, triangle and circle. His
illustrations have won him the day: his argument carries all before it: I cannot contradict
the statement that those names which are entirely incommunicable indicate difference of
natures. But our man of keen and quick-sighted intellect has just missed seeing these
points:—that in this case the Father is God and the Son is God; that “just,” and “incorruptible,”
and all those names which belong to the Divine Nature, are used equally of the Father
and of the Son; and thus, if the divergent character of appellations indicates difference of
natures, the community of names will surely show the common character of the essence.
And if we must agree that the Divine essence is to be expressed by names834, it would behove
us to apply to that Nature these lofty and Divine names rather than the terminology of
“generate” and “ungenerate,” because “good” and “incorruptible,” “just” and “wise,” and
<note type="footnote">834 On this point, besides what follows here, see the treatise against Tritheism addressed to Ablabius.</note>

<pb n="377"/>
all such terms as these are strictly applicable only to that Nature which passes all understanding,
whereas “generated” exhibits community of name with even the inferior forms of the
lower creation. For we call a dog, and a frog, and all things that come into the world by way
of generation, “generated.” And moreover, the term “ungenerate” is not only employed of
that which exists without a cause, but has also a proper application to that which is nonexistent.
The Scindapsus835 is called ungenerate, the Blityri836 is ungenerate, the Minotaur is
ungenerate, the Cyclops, Scylla, the Chimæra are ungenerate, not in the sense of existing
without generation, but in the sense of never having come into being at all. If, then, the
names more peculiarly Divine are common to the Son with the Father, and if it is the others,
those which are equivocally employed either of the non-existent or of the lower animals—if
it is these, I say, which are divergent, let his “generate and ungenerate” be so: Eunomius’
powerful argument against us itself upholds the cause of truth in testifying that there is no
divergence in respect of nature, because no divergence can be perceived in the names837.
But if he asserts the difference of essence to exist between the “generate” and the “ungenerate,”
as it does between fire and water, and is of opinion that the names, like those which he has
mentioned in his examples, are in the same mutual relation as “fire” and “water,” the horrid
character of his blasphemy will here again be brought to light, even if we hold our peace.
For fire and water have a nature mutually destructive, and each is destroyed, if it comes to
be in the other, by the prevalence of the more powerful element. If, then, he lays down the
doctrine that the Nature of the Ungenerate differs thus from that of the Only-begotten, it
is surely clear that he logically makes this destructive opposition to be involved in the divergence
of their essences, so that their nature will be, by this reasoning, incompatible and incommunicable,
and the one would be consumed by the other, if both should be found to
be mutually inclusive or co-existent.</p>
<p>How then is the Son “in the Father” without being destroyed, and how does the Father,
coming to be “in the Son,” remain continually unconsumed, if, as Eunomius says, the special
attribute of fire, as compared with water, is maintained in the relation of the Generate to
the Ungenerate? Nor does their definition regard communion as existing between earth
and air, for the former is stable, solid, resistent, of downward tendency and heavy, while air
has a nature made up of the contrary attributes. So white and black are found in opposition
among colours, and men are agreed that the circle is not the same with the triangle, for each,
according to the definition of its figure, is precisely that which the other is not. But I am

unable to discover where he sees the opposition in the case of God the Father and God the
Only-begotten Son. One goodness, wisdom, justice, providence, power, incorruptibility,—all
other attributes of exalted significance are similarly predicated of each, and the one has in
a certain sense His strength in the other; for on the one hand the Father makes all things
through the Son, and on the other hand the Only-begotten works all in Himself, being the
Power of the Father. Of what avail, then, are fire and water to show essential diversity in the
Father and the Son? He calls us, moreover, “rash” for instancing the unity of nature and
difference of persons of Peter and Paul, and says we are guilty of gross recklessness, if we
apply our argument to the contemplation of the objects of pure reason by the aid of material
examples. Fitly, fitly indeed, does the corrector of our errors reprove us for rashness in
interpreting the Divine Nature by material illustrations! Why then, deliberate and circumspect
sir, do you talk about the elements? Is earth immaterial, fire an object of pure reason, water
incorporeal, air beyond the perception of the senses? Is your mind so well directed to its
aim, are you so keen-sighted in all directions in your promulgation of this argument, that
your adversaries cannot lay hold of, that you do not see in yourself the faults you blame in
those you are accusing? Or are we to make concessions to you when you are establishing
the diversity of essence by material aid, and to be ourselves rejected when we point out the
kindred character of the Nature by means of examples within our compass?</p>

<head>§4. He says that all things that are in creation have been named by man, if, as is the case, they
are called differently by every nation, as also the appellation of “Ungenerate” is conferred
by us: but that the proper appellation of the Divine essence itself which expresses the Divine
Nature, either does not exist at all, or is unknown to us.</head>
<p>But Peter and Paul, he says, were named by men, and hence it comes that it is possible
in their case to change the appellations. Why, what existing thing has not been named by
men? I call you to testify on behalf of my argument. For if you make change of names a sign
of things having been named by men, you will thereby surely allow that every name has
been imposed upon things by us, since the same appellations of objects have not obtained
universally. For as in the case of Paul who was once Saul, and of Peter who was formerly
Simon, so earth and sky and air and sea and all the parts of the creation have not been named
alike by all, but are named in one way by the Hebrews, and in another way by us, and are
denoted by every nation by different names. If then Eunomius’ argument is valid when he
maintains that it was for this reason, to wit, that their names had been imposed by men,
that Peter and Paul were named afresh, our teaching will surely be valid also, starting as it
does from like premises, which says that all things are named by us, on the ground that their
appellations vary according to the distinctions of nations. Now if all things are so, surely
the Generate and the Ungenerate are not exceptions, for even they are among the things
that change their name. For when we gather, as it were, into the form of a name the conception
of any subject that arises in us, we declare our concept by words that vary at different
times, not making, but signifying, the thing by the name we give it. For the things remain
in themselves as they naturally are, while the mind, touching on existing things, reveals its
thought by such words as are available. And just as the essence of Peter was not changed
with the change of his name, so neither is any other of the things we contemplate changed
in the process of mutation of names. And for this reason we say that the term “Ungenerate”
was applied by us to the true and first Father Who is the Cause of all, and that no harm
would result as regards the signifying of the Subject, if we were to acknowledge the same
concept under another name. For it is allowable instead of speaking of Him as “Ungenerate,”
to call Him the “First Cause” or “Father of the Only-begotten,” or to speak of Him as “existing
without cause,” and many such appellations which lead to the same thought; so that Eunomius
confirms our doctrines by the very arguments in which he makes complaint against
us, because we know no name significant of the Divine Nature. We are taught the fact of
Its existence, while we assert that an appellation of such force as to include the unspeakable
and infinite Nature, either does not exist at all, or at any rate is unknown to us. Let him then
leave his accustomed language of fable, and show us the names which signify the essences,
and then proceed further to divide the subject by the divergence of their names. But so long
as the saying of the Scripture is true that Abraham and Moses were not capable of the

<pb n="380"/>
knowledge of the Name, and that “no man hath seen God at any time838,” and that “no man
hath seen Him, nor can see839,” and that the light around Him is unapproachable840, and
“there is no end of His greatness841”;—so long as we say and believe these things, how like
is an argument that promises any comprehension and expression of the infinite Nature, by
means of the significance of names, to one who thinks that he can enclose the whole sea in
his own hand! for as the hollow of one’s hand is to the whole deep, so is all the power of
language in comparison with that Nature which is unspeakable and incomprehensible.</p>

<head>§5. After much discourse concerning the actually existent, and ungenerate and good, and upon
the consubstantiality of the heavenly powers, showing the uncharted character of their
essence, yet the difference of their ranks, he ends the book.</head>
<p>Now in saying these things we do not intend to deny that the Father exists without
generation, and we have no intention of refusing to agree to the statement that the Onlybegotten
God is generated;—on the contrary the latter has been generated, the former has
not been generated. But what He is, in His own Nature, Who exists apart from generation,
and what He is, Who is believed to have been generated, we do not learn from the signification
of “having been generated,” and “not having been generated.” For when we say “this
person was generated” (or “was not generated”), we are impressed with a two-fold thought,
having our eyes turned to the subject by the demonstrative part of the phrase, and learning
that which is contemplated in the subject by the words “was generated” or “was not generated,”—
as it is one thing to think of that which is, and another to think of what we contemplate
in that which is. But, moreover, the word “is” is surely understood with every name
that is used concerning the Divine Nature,—as “just,” “incorruptible,” “immortal,” and
“ungenerate,” and whatever else is said of Him; even if this word does not happen to occur
in the phrase, yet the thought both of the speaker and the hearer surely makes the name attach
to “is,” so that if this word were not added, the appellation would be uttered in vain. For
instance (for it is better to present an argument by way of illustration), when David says,
“God, a righteous judge, strong and patient842,” if “is” were not understood with each of
the epithets included in the phrase, the enumerations of the appellations will seem purposeless
and unreal, not having any subject to rest upon; but when “is” is understood with each of
the names, what is said will clearly be of force, being contemplated in reference to that which
is. As, then, when we say “He is a judge,” we conceive concerning Him some operation of
judgment, and by the “is” carry our minds to the subject, and are hereby clearly taught not
to suppose that the account of His being is the same with the action, so also as a result of
saying, “He is generated (or ungenerate),” we divide our thought into a double conception,
by “is” understanding the subject, and by “generated,” or “ungenerate,” apprehending that
which belongs to the subject. As, then, when we are taught by David that God is “a judge,”
or “patient,” we do not learn the Divine essence, but one of the attributes which are contemplated
in it, so in this case too when we hear of His being not generated, we do not by this
negative predication understand the subject, but are guided as to what we must not think
concerning the subject, while what He essentially is remains as much as ever unexplained.
So too, when Holy Scripture predicates the other Divine names of Him Who is, and delivers
to Moses the Being without a name, it is for him who discloses the Nature of that Being, not
to rehearse the attributes of the Being, but by his words to make manifest to us its actual
<note type="footnote">842 Cf. Ps. vii. 8</note>

<pb n="382"/>
Nature. For every name which you may use is an attribute of the Being, but is not the Being,—“
good,” “ungenerate,” “incorruptible,”—but to each of these “is” does not fail to be
supplied. Any one, then, who undertakes to give the account of this good Being, of this ungenerate
Being, as He is, would speak in vain, if he rehearsed the attributes contemplated
in Him, and were silent as to that essence which he undertakes by his words to explain. To
be without generation is one of the attributes contemplated in the Being, but the definition
of “Being” is one thing, and that of “being in some particular way” is another; and this843
has so far remained untold and unexplained by the passages cited. Let him then first disclose
to us the names of the essence, and then divide the Nature by the divergence of the appellations;—
so long as what we require remains unexplained, it is in vain that he employs his
scientific skill upon names, seeing that the names844 have no separate existence.</p>
<p>Such then is Eunomius’ stronger handle against the truth, while we pass by in silence
many views which are to be found in this part of his composition; for it seems to me right
that those who run in this armed race845 against the enemies of the truth should arm
themselves against those who are fairly fenced about with the plausibility of falsehood, and
not defile their argument with such conceptions as are already dead and of offensive odour.
His supposition that whatever things are united in the idea of their essence846 must needs
exist corporeally and be joined to corruption (for this he says in this part of his work), I
shall willingly pass by like some cadaverous odour, since I think every reasonable man will
perceive how dead and corrupt such an argument is. For who knows not that the multitude
of human souls is countless, yet one essence underlies them all, and the consubstantial
substratum in them is alien from bodily corruption? so that even children can plainly see
the argument that bodies are corrupted and dissolved, not because they have the same essence
one with another, but because of their possessing a compound nature. The idea of the
compound nature is one, that of the common nature of their essence is another, so that it
is true to say, “corruptible bodies are of one essence,” but the converse statement is not true
at all, if it be anything like, “this consubstantial nature is also surely corruptible,” as is shown
in the case of the souls which have one essence, while yet corruption does not attach to them
<note type="footnote">843 What “this” means is not clear: it may be “the Being,” but most probably is the distinction which S.
Gregory is pointing out between the Being and Its attributes, which he considers has not been sufficiently recognized.</note>

in virtue of the community of essence. And the account given of the souls might properly
be applied to every intellectual existence which we contemplate in creation. For the words
brought together by Paul do not signify, as Eunomius will have them do, some mutually
divergent natures of the supra-mundane powers; on the contrary, the sense of the names
clearly indicates that he is mentioning in his argument, not diversities of natures, but the
varied peculiarities of the operations of the heavenly host: for there are, he says, “principalities,”
and “thrones,” and “powers,” and “mights,” and “dominions847.” Now these names
are such as to make it at once clear to every one that their significance is arranged in regard
to some operation. For to rule, and to exercise power and dominion, and to be the throne
of some one,—all these conceptions would not be held by any one versed in argument to
apply to diversities of essence, since it is clearly operation that is signified by every one of
the names: so that any one who says that diversities of nature are signified by the names
rehearsed by Paul deceives himself, “understanding,” as the Apostle says, “neither what he
says, nor whereof he affirms848,” since the sense of the names clearly shows that the Apostle
recognizes in the intelligible powers distinctions of certain ranks, but does not by these
names indicate varieties of essences.</p>

<head>Book VIII.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">  
<head>§1. The eighth book very notably overthrows the blasphemy of the heretics who say that the
Only-begotten came from nothing, and that there was a time when He was not, and shows
the Son to be no new being, but from everlasting, from His having said to Moses, “I am
He that is,” and to Manoah, “Why askest thou My name? It also is wonderful”;—moreover
David also says to God, “Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail;” and furthermore
Isaiah says, “I am God, the first, and hereafter am I:” and the Evangelist, “He was in the
beginning, and was with God, and was God:”—and that He has neither beginning nor
end: —and he proves that those who say that He is new and comes from nothing are idolaters.
And herein he very finely interprets “the brightness of the glory, and the express
image of the Person.”</head>
<p>These, then, are the strong points of Eunomius’ case; and I think that when those which
promised to be powerful are proved by argument to be so rotten and unsubstantial, I may
well keep silence concerning the rest, since the others are practically refuted, concurrently
with the refutation of the stronger ones; just as it happens in warlike operations that when
a force more powerful than the rest has been beaten, the remainder of the army are no longer
of any account in the eyes of those by whom the strong portion of it has been overcome.
But the fact that the chief part of his blasphemy lies in the later part of his discourse forbids
me to be silent. For the transition of the Only-begotten from nothing into being, that horrid
and godless doctrine of Eunomius, which is more to be shunned than all impiety, is next
maintained in the order of his argument. And since every one who has been bewitched by
this deceit has the phrase, “If He was, He has not been begotten, and if He has been begotten,
He was not,” ready upon his tongue for the maintenance of the doctrine that He Who made
of nothing us and all the creation is Himself from nothing, and since the deceit obtains
much support thereby, as men of feebler mind are pressed by this superficial bit of plausibility,
and led to acquiesce in the blasphemy, we must needs not pass by this doctrinal “root
of bitterness,” lest, as the Apostle says, it “spring up and trouble us849.” Now I say that we
must first of all consider the actual argument itself, apart from our contest with our opponents,
and thus afterwards proceed to the examination and refutation of what they have set
forth.</p>
<p>One mark of the true Godhead is indicated by the words of Holy Scripture, which Moses
learnt by the voice from heaven, when He heard Him Who said, “I am He that is850.” We
think it right, then, to believe that to be alone truly Divine which is represented as eternal
and infinite in respect of being; and all that is contemplated therein is always the same,
<note type="footnote">849 Cf. Heb. xii. 15</note>
<note type="footnote">850 Exod. iii. 4.</note>

<pb n="385"/>
neither growing nor being consumed; so that if one should say of God, that formerly He
was, but now is not, or that He now is, but formerly was not, we should consider each of
the sayings alike to be godless: for by both alike the idea of eternity is mutilated, being cut
short on one side or the other by non-existence, whether one contemplates “nothing” as
preceding “being851,” or declares that “being” ends in “nothing”; and the frequent repetition
of “first of all” or “last of all” concerning God’s non-existence does not make amends for
the impious conception touching the Divinity. For this reason we declare the maintenance
of their doctrine as to the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be a denial
and rejection of His true Godhead; and this on the ground that, on the one hand, He Who
showed Himself to Moses by the light speaks of Himself as being, when He says, “I am He
that is852,” while on the other, Isaiah (being made, so to say, the instrument of Him Who
spoke in him) says in the person of Him that is, “I am the first, and hereafter am I853,” so
that hereby, whichever way we consider it, we conceive eternity in God. And so, too, the
word that was spoken to Manoah shows the fact that the Divinity is not comprehensible by
the significance of His name, because, when Manoah asks to know His name, that, when
the promise has come actually to pass, he may by name glorify his benefactor, He says to
him, “Why askest thou this? It also is wonderful854”; so that by this we learn that there is
one name significant of the Divine Nature—the wonder, namely, that arises unspeakably
in our hearts concerning It. So, too, great David, in his discourses with himself, proclaims
the same truth, in the sense that all the creation was brought into being by God, while He
alone exists always in the same manner, and abides for ever, where he says, “But Thou art
the same, and Thy years shall not fail855.” When we hear these sayings, and others like them,
from men inspired by God, let us leave all that is not from eternity to the worship of idolaters,
as a new thing alien from the true Godhead. For that which now is, and formerly was not,
is clearly new and not eternal, and to have regard to any new object of worship is called by
Moses the service of demons, when he says, “They sacrificed to devils and not to God, to
gods whom their fathers knew not; new gods were they that came newly up856.” If then
everything that is new in worship is a service of demons, and is alien from the true Godhead,
and if what is now, but was not always, is new and not eternal, we who have regard to that
which is, necessarily reckon those who contemplate non-existence as attaching to Him Who
is, and who say that “He once was not,” among the worshippers of idols. For we may also

see that the great John, when declaring in his own preaching the Only-begotten God, guards
his own statement in every way, so that the conception of non-existence shall find no access
to Him Who is. For he says857 that He “was in the beginning,” and “was with God,” and
“was God,” and was light, and life, and truth, and all good things at all times, and never at
any time failed to be anything that is excellent, Who is the fulness of all good, and is in the
bosom of the Father. If then Moses lays down as a law for us some such mark of true Godhead
as this, that we know nothing else of God but this one thing, that He is (for to this point the
words, “I am He that is858”); while Isaiah in his preaching declares aloud the absolute infinity
of Him Who is, defining the existence of God as having no regard to beginning or to end
(for He Who says “I am the first, and hereafter am I,” places no limit to His eternity in either
direction, so that neither, if we look to the beginning, do we find any point marked since
which He is, and beyond which He was not, nor, if we turn our thought to the future, can
we cut short by any boundary the eternal progress of Him Who is),—and if the prophet
David forbids us to worship any new and strange God859 (both of which are involved in the
heretical doctrine; “newness” is clearly indicated in that which is not eternal, and “strangeness”
is alienation from the Nature of the very God),—if, I say, these things are so, we declare
all the sophistical fabrication about the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to
be nothing else than a departure from Christianity, and a turning to idolatry. For when the
Evangelist, in his discourse concerning the Nature of God, separates at all points non-existence
from Him Who is, and, by his constant repetition of the word “was,” carefully destroys
the suspicion of non-existence, and calls Him the Only-begotten God, the Word of God,
the Son of God, equal with God, and all such names, we have this judgment fixed and settled
in us, that if the Only-begotten Son is God, we must believe that He Who is believed to be
God is eternal. And indeed He is verily God, and assuredly is eternal, and is never at any
time found to be non-existent. For God, as we have often said, if He now is, also assuredly
always was, and if He once was not, neither does He now exist at all. But since even the enemies
of the truth confess that the Son is and continually abides the Only-begotten God,
we say this, that, being in the Father, He is not in Him in one respect only, but He is in Him
altogether, in respect of all that the Father is conceived to be. As, then, being in the incorruptibility
of the Father, He is incorruptible, good in His goodness, powerful in His might,
and, as being in each of these attributes of special excellence which are conceived of the
Father, He is that particular thing, so, also, being in His eternity, He is assuredly eternal.
Now the eternity of the Father is marked by His never having taken His being from nonexistence,
and never terminating His being in non-existence. He, therefore, Who hath all

things that are the Father’s860, and is contemplated in all the glory of the Father, even as,
being in the endlessness of the Father, He has no end, so, being in the unoriginateness of
the Father, has, as the Apostle says, “no beginning of days861,” but at once is “of the Father,”
and is regarded in the eternity of the Father: and in this respect, more especially, is seen the
complete absence of divergence in the Likeness, as compared with Him Whose Likeness He
is. And herein is His saying found true which tells us, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the
Father862.” Moreover, it is in this way that those words of the Apostle, that the Son is “the
brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person863,” are best understood to
have an excellent and close application. For the Apostle conveys to those hearers who are
unable, by the contemplation of purely intellectual objects, to elevate their thought to the
height of the knowledge of God, a sort of notion of the truth, by means of things apparent
to sense. For as the body of the sun is expressly imaged by the whole disc that surrounds it,
and he who looks on the sun argues, by means of what he sees, the existence of the whole
solid substratum, so, he says, the majesty of the Father is expressly imaged in the greatness
of the power of the Son, that the one may be believed to be as great as the other is known
to be: and again, as the radiance of light sheds its brilliancy from the whole of the sun’s disc
(for in the disc one part is not radiant, and the rest dim), so all that glory which the Father
is, sheds its brilliancy from its whole extent by means of the brightness that comes from it,
that is, by the true Light; and as the ray is of the sun (for there would be no ray if the sun
were not), yet the sun is never conceived as existing by itself without the ray of brightness
that is shed from it, so the Apostle delivering to us the continuity and eternity of that existence
which the Only-begotten has of the Father, calls the Son “the brightness of His glory.”</p>

<head>§2. He then discusses the “willing” of the Father concerning the generation of the Son, and
shows that the object of that good will is from eternity, which is the Son, existing in the
Father, and being closely related to the process of willing, as the ray to the flame, or the
act of seeing to the eye.</head>
<p>After these distinctions on our part no one can well be longer in doubt how the Onlybegotten
at once is believed to be “of the Father,” and is eternally, even if the one phrase
does not at first sight seem to agree with the other,—that which declares Him to be “of the
Father” with that which asserts His eternity. But if we are to confirm our statement by further
arguments, it may be possible to apprehend the doctrine on this point by the aid of things
cognizable by our senses. And let no one deride our statement, if it cannot find among existing
things a likeness of the object of our enquiry such as may be in all respects sufficient
for the presentation of the matter in hand by way of analogy and resemblance. For we should
like to persuade those who say that the Father first willed and so proceeded to become a
Father, and on this ground assert posteriority in existence as regards the Word, by whatever
illustrations may make it possible, to turn to the orthodox view. Neither does this immediate
conjunction exclude the “willing” of the Father, in the sense that He had a Son without
choice, by some necessity of His Nature, nor does the “willing” separate the Son from the
Father, coming in between them as a kind of interval: so that we neither reject from our
doctrine the “willing” of the Begetter directed to the Son, as being, so to say, forced out by
the conjunction of the Son’s oneness with the Father, nor do we by any means break that
inseparable connection, when “willing” is regarded as involved in the generation. For to our
heavy and inert nature it properly belongs that the wish and the possession of a thing are
not often present with us at the same moment; but now we wish for something we have not,
and at another time we obtain what we do not wish to obtain. But, in the case of the simple
and all-powerful Nature, all things are conceived together and at once, the willing of good
as well as the possession of what He wills. For the good and the eternal will is contemplated
as operating, indwelling, and co-existing in the eternal Nature, not arising in it from any
separate principle, nor capable of being conceived apart from the object of will: for it is not
possible that with God either the good will should not be, or the object of will should not
accompany the act of will, since no cause can either bring it about that that which befits the
Father should not always be, or be any hindrance to the possession of the object of will.
Since, then, the Only-begotten God is by nature the good (or rather beyond all good), and
since the good does not fail to be the object of the Father’s will, it is hereby clearly shown,
both that the conjunction of the Son with the Father is without any intermediary, and also
that the will, which is always present in the good Nature, is not forced out nor excluded by
reason of this inseparable conjunction. And if any one is listening to my argument in no
scoffing spirit, I should like to add to what I have already said something of the following
kind.</p>

<pb n="389"/>
<p>Just as, if one were to grant (I speak, of course, hypothetically) the power of deliberate
choice to belong to flame, it would be clear that the flame will at once upon its existence
will that its radiance should shine forth from itself, and when it wills it will not be impotent
(since, on the appearance of the flame, its natural power at once fulfils its will in the matter
of the radiance), so that undoubtedly, if it be granted that the flame is moved by deliberate
choice, we conceive the concurrence of all these things simultaneously—of the kindling of
the fire, of its act of will concerning the radiance, and of the radiance itself; so that the
movement by way of choice is no hindrance to the dignity of the existence of the radiance,—
even so, according to the illustration we have spoken of, you will not, by confessing
the good act of will as existing in the Father, separate by that act of will the Son from the
Father. For it is not reasonable to suppose that the act of willing that He should be, could
be a hindrance to His immediately coming into being; but just as, in the eye, seeing and the
will to see are, one an operation of nature, the other an impulse of choice, yet no delay is
caused to the act of sight by the movement of choice in that particular direction864,—(for
each of these is regarded separately and by itself, not as being at all a hindrance to the existence
of the other, but as both being somehow interexistent, the natural operation concurring
with the choice, and the choice in turn not failing to be accompanied by the natural motion)—
as, I say, perception naturally belongs to the eye, and the willing to see produces no
delay in respect to actual sight, but one wills that it should have vision, and immediately
what he wills is, so also in the case of that Nature which is unspeakable and above all thought,
our apprehension of all comes together simultaneously—of the eternal existence of the
Father, and of an act of will concerning the Son, and of the Son Himself, Who is, as John
says, “in the beginning,” and is not conceived as coming after the beginning. Now the beginning
of all is the Father; but in this beginning the Son also is declared to be, being in His
Nature that very thing which the Beginning is. For the Beginning is God, and the Word
Who “was in the Beginning” is God. As then the phrase “the beginning” points to eternity,
John well conjoins “the Word in the Beginning,” saying that the Word was in It; asserting,
I suppose, this fact to the end that the first idea present to the mind of his hearer may not
be “the Beginning” alone by itself, but that, before this has been impressed upon him, there
should also be presented to his mind, together with the Beginning the Word Who was in
It, entering with It into the hearer’s understanding, and being present to his hearing at the

<head>§3. Then, thus passing over what relates to the essence of the Son as having been already discussed,
he treats of the sense involved in “generation,” saying that there are diverse generations,
those effected by matter and art, and of buildings,—and that by succession of animals,—
and those by efflux, as by the sun and its beam. The lamp and its radiance, scents
and ointments and the quality diffused by them,—and the word produced by the mind;
and cleverly discusses generation865 from rotten wood; and from the condensation of fire,
and countless other causes.</head>
<p>Now that we have thus thoroughly scrutinized our doctrine, it may perhaps be time to
set forth and to consider the opposing statement, examining it side by side in comparison
with our own opinion. He states it thus:—“For while there are,” he says, “two statements
which we have made, the one, that the essence of the Only-begotten was not before its own
generation, the other that, being generated, it was before all things, he866 does not prove
either of these statements to be untrue; for he did not venture to say that He was before that
supreme867 generation and formation, seeing that he is opposed at once by the Nature of
the Father, and the judgment of sober-minded men. For what sober man could admit the
Son to be and to be begotten before that supreme generation? and He Who is without generation
needs not generation in order to His being what He is.” Well, whether he speaks
truly, when he says that our master868 opposed his antitheses to no purpose, all may surely
be aware who have been conversant with that writer’s works. But for my own part (for I
think that the refutation of his calumny on this matter is a small step towards the exposure
of his malice), I will leave the task of showing that this point was not passed over by our
master without discussion, and turn my argument to the discussion, as far as in me lies, of
the points now advanced. He says that he has in his own discourse spoken of two matters,—
one, that the essence of the Only-begotten was not before Its own generation, the
other, that, being generated, It was before all things. Now I think that by what we have
already said, the fact has been sufficiently shown that no new essence was begotten by the
Father besides that which is contemplated in the Father Himself, and that there is no need

for us to be entangled in a contest with blasphemy of this kind, as if the argument were now
propounded to us for the first time; and further, that the real force of our argument must
be directed to one point, I mean to his horrible and blasphemous utterance, which clearly
states concerning God the Word that “He was not.” Moreover, as our argument in the
foregoing discourse has already to some extent dealt with the question of his blasphemy, it
would perhaps be superfluous again to establish by like considerations what we have proved
already. For it was to this end that we made those former statements, that by the earlier
impression upon our hearers of an orthodox mode of thought, the blasphemy of our adversaries,
who assert that non-existence preceded existence in the case of the Only-begotten
God, might be more manifest.</p>
<p>It seems at this point well to investigate in our argument, by a more careful examination,
the actual significance of “generation.” That this name presents to us the fact of being as the
result of some cause is clear to every one, and about this point there is, I suppose, no need
to dispute. But since the account to be given of things which exist as the result of cause is
various, I think it proper that this matter should be cleared up in our discourse by some
sort of scientific division. Of things, then, which are the result of something, we understand
the varieties to be as follows. Some are the result of matter and art, as the structure of
buildings and of other works, coming into being by means of their respective matter, and
these are directed by some art that accomplishes the thing proposed, with a view to the
proper aim of the results produced. Others are the results of matter and nature; for the
generations of animals are the building869 of nature, who carries on her own operation by
means of their material bodily subsistence. Others are the result of material efflux, in which
cases the antecedent remains in its natural condition, while that which flows from it is
conceived separately, as in the case of the sun and its beam, or the lamp and its brightness,
or of scents and ointments and the quality they emit; for these, while they remain in themselves
without diminution, have at the same time, each concurrently with itself, that natural
property which they emit: as the sun its beam, the lamp its brightness, the scents the perfume
produced by them in the air. There is also another species of “generation” besides these, in
which the cause is immaterial and incorporeal, but the generation is an object of sense and
takes place by corporeal means;—I speak of the word which is begotten by the mind: for
the mind, being itself incorporeal, brings forth the word by means of the organs of sense.
All these varieties of generation we mentally include, as it were, in one general view. For all
the wonders that are wrought by nature, which changes the bodies of some animals to
something of a different kind, or produces some animals from a change in liquids, or a
corruption of seed, or the rotting of wood, or out of the condensed mass of fire transforms
the cold vapour that issues from the firebrands, shut off in the heart of the fire, to produce
<note type="footnote">869 Or (reading as proposed above, p. 114, οἰκονομεῖ for οἰκοδομεῖ), “the ordering of nature.”</note>

<pb n="392"/>
an animal which they call the salamander,—these, even if they seem to be outside the limits
we have laid down, are none the less included among the cases we have mentioned. For it
is by means of bodies that nature fashions these varied forms of animals; for it is such and
such a change of body, disposed by nature in this or that particular way, which produces
this or that particular animal; and this is not a distinct species of generation besides that
which is accomplished as the result of nature and matter.</p>

<head>§4. He further shows the operations of God to be expressed by human illustrations; for what
hands and feet and the other parts of the body with which men work are, that, in the case
of God, the will alone is, in place of these. And so also arises the divergence of generation;
wherefore He is called Only-begotten, because He has no community with other generation
such as is observed in creation870, but in that He is called the “brightness of glory,” and
the “savour of ointment,” He shows the close conjunction and co-eternity of His Nature
with the Father871</head>
<p>Now these modes of generation being well known to men, the loving dispensation of
the Holy Spirit, in delivering to us the Divine mysteries, conveys its instruction on those
matters which transcend language by means of what is within our capacity, as it does also
constantly elsewhere, when it portrays the Divinity in bodily terms, making mention, in
speaking concerning God, of His eye, His eyelids, His ear, His fingers, His hand, His right
hand, His arm, His feet, His shoes872, and the like,—none of which things is apprehended
to belong in its primary sense to the Divine Nature,—but turning its teaching to what we
can easily perceive, it describes by terms well worn in human use, facts that are beyond every
name, while by each of the terms employed concerning God we are led analogically to some
more exalted conception. In this way, then, it employs the numerous forms of generation
to present to us, from the inspired teaching, the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten,
taking just so much from each as may be reverently admitted into our conceptions concerning
God. For as its mention of “fingers,” “hand,” and “arm,” in speaking of God, does not by
the phrase portray the structure of the limb out of bones and sinews and flesh and ligaments,
but signifies by such an expression His effective and operative power, and as it indicates by
each of the other words of this kind those conceptions concerning God which correspond
to them, not admitting the corporeal senses of the words, so also it speaks indeed of the
forms of these modes of coming into being as applied to the Divine Nature, yet does not
speak in that sense which our customary knowledge enables us to understand. For when it
speaks of the formative power, it calls that particular energy by the name of “generation,”
because the word expressive of Divine power must needs descend to our lowliness, yet it
does not indicate all that is associated with formative generation among ourselves,—neither
place nor time nor preparation of material, nor the co-operation of instruments, nor the
purpose in the things produced, but it leaves these out of sight, and greatly and loftily claims
for God the generation of the things that are, where it says, “He spake and they were begotten,
He commanded and they were created873.” Again, when it expounds that unspeakable and

<pb n="394"/>
transcendent existence which the Only-begotten has from the Father, because human poverty
is incapable of the truths that are too high for speech or thought, it uses our language here
also, and calls Him by the name of “Son,”—a name which our ordinary use applies to those
who are produced by matter and nature. But just as the word, which tells us in reference to
God of the “generation” of the creation, did not add the statement that it was generated by
the aid of any material, declaring that its material substance, its place, its time, and all the
like, had their existence in the power of His will, so here too, in speaking of the “Son,” it
leaves out of sight both all other things which human nature sees in earthly generation
(passions, I mean, and dispositions, and the co-operation of time and the need of place, and
especially matter), without all which earthly generation as a result of nature does not occur.
Now every such conception of matter and interval being excluded from the sense of the
word “Son,” nature alone remains, and hereby in the word “Son” is declared concerning
the Only-begotten the close and true character of His manifestation from the Father. And
since this particular species of generation did not suffice to produce in us an adequate idea
of the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, it employs also another species of generation,
that which is the result of efflux, to express the Divine Nature of the Son, and calls
Him “the brightness of glory874,” the “savour of ointment875,” the “breath of God876,” which
our accustomed use, in the scientific discussion we have already made, calls material efflux.
But just as in the previous cases neither the making of creation nor the significance of the
word “Son” admitted time, or matter, or place, or passion, so here also the phrase, purifying
the sense of “brightness” and the other terms from every material conception, and employing
only that element in this particular species of generation which is suitable to the Divinity,
points by the force of this mode of expression to the truth that He is conceived as being
both from Him and with Him. For neither does the word “breath” present to us dispersion
into the air from the underlying matter, nor “savour” the transference that takes place from
the quality of the ointment to the air, nor “brightness” the efflux by means of rays from the
body of the sun; but this only, as we have said, is manifested by this particular mode of
generation, that He is conceived to be of Him and also with Him, no intermediate interval
existing between the Father and that Son Who is of Him. And since, in its abundant lovingkindness,
the grace of the Holy Spirit has ordered that our conceptions concerning the Onlybegotten
Son should arise in us from many sources, it has added also the remaining species
of things contemplated in generation,—that, I mean, which is the result of mind and word.
But the lofty John uses especial foresight that the hearer may not by any means by inattention
or feebleness of thought fall into the common understanding of “Word,” so that the Son

<note type="footnote">876 Wisd. vii. 25.</note>

<pb n="395"/>
should be supposed to be the voice of the Father. For this reason he prepares us at his first
proclamation to regard the Word as in essence, and not in any essence foreign to or dissevered
from that essence whence It has Its being, but in that first and blessed Nature. For this is
what he teaches us when he says the Word “was in the beginning877,” and “was with God878,”
being Himself also both God and all else that the “Beginning” is. For thus it is that he makes
his discourse on the Godhead, touching the eternity of the Only-begotten. Seeing then that
these modes of generation (those, I mean, which are the result of cause) are ordinarily known
among us, and are employed by Holy Scripture for our instruction on the subjects before
us, in such a way as it might be expected that each of them would be applied to the
presentation of Divine conceptions, let the reader of our argument “judge righteous judgement879,”
whether any of the assertions that heresy makes have any force against the truth.</p>

<head>§5. Then, after showing that the Person of the Only-begotten and Maker of things has no beginning,
as have the things that were made by Him, as Eunomius says, but that the Onlybegotten
is without beginning and eternal, and has no community, either of essence or of
names, with the creation, but is co-existent with the Father from everlasting, being, as the
all-excellent Wisdom says, “the beginning and end and midst of the times,” and after
making many observations on the Godhead and eternity of the Only-begotten, and also
concerning souls and angels, and life and death, he concludes the book.</head>
<p>I will now once more subjoin the actual language of my opponent, word for word. It
runs thus:—“While there are,” he says, “two statements which we have made, the one, that
the essence of the Only-begotten was not before its own generation, the other, that, being
generated, it was before all things—”What kind of generation does our dogmatist propose
to us? Is it one of which we may fittingly think and speak in regard to God? And who is so
godless as to pre-suppose non-existence in God? But it is clear that he has in view this material
generation of ours, and is making the lower nature the teacher of his conceptions
concerning the Only-begotten God, and since an ox or an ass or a camel is not before its
own generation, he thinks it proper to say even of the Only-begotten God that which the
course of the lower nature presents to our view in the case of the animals, without thinking,
corporeal theologian that he is, of this fact, that the predicate “Only-begotten”, applied to
God, signifies by the very word itself that which is not in common with all begetting, and
is peculiar to Him. How could the term “Only-begotten” be used of this “generation,” if it
had community and identity of meaning with other generation? That there is something
unique and exceptional to be understood in His case, which is not to be remarked in other
generation, is distinctly and suitably expressed by the appellation of “Only-begotten”; as,
were any element of the lower generation conceived in it, He Who in respect of any of the
attributes of His generation was placed on a level with other things that are begotten would
no longer be “Only-begotten.” For if the same things are to be said of Him which are said
of the other things that come into being by generation, the definition will transform the
sense of “Only-begotten” to signify a kind of relationship involving brotherhood. If then
the sense of “Only-begotten” points to absence of mixture and community with the rest of
generated things, we shall not admit that anything which we behold in the lower generation
is also to be conceived in the case of that existence which the Son has from the Father. But
non-existence before generation is proper to all things that exist by generation: therefore
this is foreign to the special character of the Only-begotten, to which the name “Only-begotten”
bears witness that there attaches nothing belonging to the mode of that form of common
generation which Eunomius misapprehends. Let this materialist and friend of the senses be
persuaded therefore to correct the error of his conception by the other forms of generation.
What will you say when you hear of the “brightness of glory” or of the “savour of oint-

<pb n="397"/>
ment880?” That the “brightness” was not before its own generation? But if you answer thus,
you will surely admit that neither did the “glory” exist, nor the “ointment”: for it is not
possible that the “glory” should be conceived as having existed by itself, dark and lustreless,
or the “ointment” without producing its sweet breath: so that if the “brightness” “was not,”
the “glory” also surely “was not,” and the “savour” being non-existent, there is also proved
the non-existence of the “ointment.” But if these examples taken from Scripture excite any
man’s fear, on the ground that they do not accurately present to us the majesty of the Onlybegotten,
because neither is essentially the same with its substratum—neither the exhalation
with the ointment, nor the beam with the sun—let the true Word correct his fear, Who was
in the Beginning and is all that the Beginning is, and existent before all; since John so declares
in his preaching, “And the Word was with God, and the Word was God881.” If then the
Father is God and the Son is God, what doubt still remains with regard to the perfect Divinity
of the Only-begotten, when by the sense of the word “Son” is acknowledged the close relationship
of Nature, by “brightness” the conjunction and inseparability, and by the appellation
of “God,” applied alike to the Father and the Son, their absolute equality, while the “express
image,” contemplated in reference to the whole Person882 of the Father, marks the absence
of any defect in the Son’s proper greatness, and the “form of God” indicates His complete
identity by showing in itself all those marks by which the Godhead is betokened.</p>
<p>Let us now set forth Eunomius’ statement once more. “He was not,” he says, “before
His own generation.” Who is it of Whom he says “He was not”? Let him declare the Divine
names by which He Who, according to Eunomius, “once was not,” is called. He will say, I
suppose, “light,” and “blessedness,” “life” and “incorruptibility,” and “righteousness” and
“sanctification,” and “power,” and “truth,” and the like. He who says, then, that “He was
not before His generation,” absolutely proclaims this,—that when He “was not” there was
no truth, no life, no light, no power, no incorruptibility, no other of those pre-eminent
qualities which are conceived of Him: and, what is still more marvellous and still more difficult
for impiety to face, there was no “brightness,” no “express image.” For in saying that
there was no brightness, there is surely maintained also the non-existence of the radiating
power, as one may see in the illustration afforded by the lamp. For he who speaks of the ray
of the lamp indicates also that the lamp shines, and he who says that the ray “is not,” signifies
also the extinction of that which gives light: so that when the Son is said not to be, thereby
is also maintained as a necessary consequence the non-existence of the Father. For if the
one is related to the other by way of conjunction, according to the Apostolic testimony—the
“brightness” to the “glory,” the “express image” to the “Person,” the “Wisdom” to God—he
<note type="footnote">880 Heb. i. 3, and Cant. i. 3, referred to above.</note>
<note type="footnote">881 S. John i. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">882 ὑποστάσει</note>

<pb n="398"/>
who says that one of the things so conjoined “is not,” surely by his abolition of the one abolishes
also that which remains; so that if the “brightness” “was not,” it is acknowledged
that neither did the illuminating nature exist, and if the “express image” had no existence,
neither did the Person imaged exist, and if the wisdom and power of God “was not,” it is
surely acknowledged that He also was not, Who is not conceived by Himself without wisdom
and power. If, then, the Only-begotten God, as Eunomius says, “was not before His generation,”
and Christ is “the power of God and the wisdom of God883,” and the “express image”884
and the “brightness885,” neither surely did the Father exist, Whose power and wisdom and
express image and brightness the Son is: for it is not possible to conceive by reason either
a Person without express image, or glory without radiance, or God without wisdom, or a
Maker without hands, or a Beginning without the Word886, or a Father without a Son; but
all such things, alike by those who confess and by those who deny, are manifestly declared
to be in mutual union, and by the abolition of one the other also disappears with it. Since
then they maintain that the Son (that is, the “brightness of the glory,”) “was not” before He
was begotten, and since logical consequence involves also, together with the non-existence
of the brightness, the abolition of the glory, and the Father is the glory whence came the
brightness of the Only-begotten Light, let these men who are wise over-much consider that
they are manifestly supporters of the Epicurean doctrines, preaching atheism under the
guise of Christianity. Now since the logical consequence is shown to be one of two absurdities,
either that we should say that God does not exist at all, or that we should say that His being
was not unoriginate, let them choose which they like of the two courses before them,—either
to be called atheist, or to cease saying that the essence of the Father is un-originate. They
would avoid, I suppose, being reckoned atheists. It remains, therefore, that they maintain
that God is not eternal. And if the course of what has been proved forces them to this, what
becomes of their varied and irreversible conversions of names? What becomes of that invincible
compulsion of their syllogisms, which sounded so fine to the ears of old women, with
its opposition of “Generated” and “Ungenerate”?</p>
<p>Enough, however, of these matters. But it might be well not to leave his next point unanswered;
yet let us pass over in silence the comic interlude, where our clever orator shows
his youthful conceit, whether in jest or in earnest, under the impression that he will thereby
have an advantage in his argument. For certainly no one will force us to join either with
those whose eyes are set askance in distorting our sight, or with those who are stricken with
strange disease in being contorted, or in their bodily leaps and plunges. We shall pity them,

<pb n="399"/>
but we shall not depart from our settled state of mind. He says, then, turning his discourse
upon the subject to our master, as if he were really engaging him face to face, “Thou shalt
be taken in thine own snare.” For as Basil had said887 that what is good is always present
with God Who is over all, and that it is good to be the Father of such a Son,—that so what
is good was never absent from Him, nor was it the Father’s will to be without the Son, and
when He willed He did not lack the power, but having the power and the will to be in the
mode in which it seemed good to Him, He also always possessed the Son by reason of His
always willing that which is good (for this is the direction in which the intention of our
father’s remarks tends), Eunomius pulls this in pieces beforehand, and puts forward to
overthrow what has been said some such argument as this, introduced from his extraneous
philosophy:—“What will become of you,” he says, “if one of those who have had experience
of such arguments should say, ‘If to create is good and agreeable to the Nature of God, how
is it that what is good and agreeable to His Nature was not present with Him unoriginately,
seeing that God is unoriginate? and that when there was no hindrance of ignorance or impediment
of weakness or of age in the matter of creation,”—and all the rest that he collects
together and pours out upon himself,—for I may not say, upon God. Well, if it were possible
for our master to answer the question in person, he would have shown Eunomius what
would have become of him, as he asked, by setting forth the Divine mystery with that tongue
that was taught of God, and by scourging the champion of deceit with his refutations, so
that it would have been made clear to all men what a difference there is between a minister
of the mysteries of Christ and a ridiculous buffoon or a setter-forth of new and absurd
doctrines. But since he, as the Apostle says, “being dead, speaketh888” to God, while the
other puts forth such a challenge as though there were no one to answer him, even though
an answer from us may not have equal force when compared with the words of the great
Basil, we shall yet boldly say this in answer to the questioner:—Your own argument, put
forth to overthrow our statement, is a testimony that in the charges we make against your
impious doctrine we speak truly. For there is no other point we blame so much as this, that
you889 think there is no difference between the Lord of creation and the general body of
creation, and what you now allege is a maintaining of the very things which we find fault
with. For if you are bound to attach exactly what you see in creation also to the Only-begotten
God, our contention has gained its end: your own statements proclaim the absurdity of the
doctrine, and it is manifest to all, both that we keep our argument in the straight way of

truth, and that your conception of the Only-begotten God is such as you have of the rest of
the creation.</p>
<p>Concerning whom was the controversy? Was it not concerning the Only-begotten God,
the Maker of all the creation, whether He always was, or whether He came into being afterwards
as an addition to His Father? What then do our master’s words say on this matter?
That it is irreverent to believe that what is naturally good was not in God: for that he saw
no cause by which it was probable that the good was not always present with Him Who is
good, either for lack of power or for weakness of will. What does he who contends against
these statements say? “If you allow that God the Word is to be believed eternal, you must
allow the same of the things that have been created”—(How well he knows how to distinguish
in his argument the nature of the creatures and the majesty of God! How well he knows
about each, what befits it, what he may piously think concerning God, what concerning the
creation!)—“if the Maker,” he says, “begins from the time of His making: for there is nothing
else by which we can mark the beginning of things that have been made, if time does not
define by its own interval the beginnings and the endings of the things that come into being.”</p>
<p>On this ground he says that the Maker of time must commence His existence from a
like beginning. Well, the creation has the ages for its beginning, but what beginning can
you conceive of the Maker of the ages? If any one should say, “The ‘beginning’ which is
mentioned in the Gospel”—it is the Father Who is there signified, and the confession of the
Son together with Him is there pointed to, nor can it be that He Who is in the Father890, as
the Lord says, can begin His being in Him from any particular point. And if any one speaks
of another beginning besides this, let him tell us the name by which he marks this beginning,
as none can be apprehended before the establishment of the ages. Such a statement, therefore,
will not move us a whit from the orthodox conception concerning the Only-begotten, even
if old women do applaud the proposition as a sound one. For we abide by what has been
determined from the beginning, having our doctrine firmly based on truth, to wit, that all
things which the orthodox doctrine assumes that we assert concerning the Only-begotten
God have no kindred with the creation, but the marks which distinguish the Maker of all
and His works are separated by a wide interval. If indeed the Son had in any other respect
communion with the creation, we surely ought to say that He did not diverge from it even
in the manner of His existence. But if the creation has no share in such things as are all those
which we learn concerning the Son, we must surely of necessity say that in this matter also
He has no communion with it. For the creation was not in the beginning, and was not with
God, and was not, God, nor life, nor light, nor resurrection, nor the rest of the Divine names,
as truth, righteousness, sanctification, Judge, just, Maker of all things, existing before the
ages, for ever and ever; the creation is not the brightness of the glory, nor the express image

<pb n="401"/>
of the Person, nor the likeness of goodness, nor grace, nor power, nor truth, nor salvation,
nor redemption; nor do we find any one at all of those names which are employed by
Scripture for the glory of the Only-begotten, either belonging to the creation or employed
concerning it,—not to speak of those more exalted words, “I am in the Father, and the
Father in Me891,” and, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father892,” and, “None hath
seen the Son, save the Father893.” If indeed our doctrine allowed us to claim for the creation
things so many and so great as these, he might have been right in thinking that we ought to
attach what we observe in it to our conceptions of the Only-begotten also, since the transfer
would be from kindred subjects to one nearly allied. But if all these concepts and names
involve communion with the Father, while they transcend our notions of the creation, does
not our clever and sharp-witted friend slink away in shame at discussing the nature of the
Lord of the Creation by the aid of what he observes in creation, without being aware that
the marks which distinguish the creation are of a different sort? The ultimate division of all
that exists is made by the line between “created” and “uncreated,” the one being regarded
as a cause of what has come into being, the other as coming into being thereby. Now the
created nature and the Divine essence being thus divided, and admitting no intermixture
in respect of their distinguishing properties, we must by no means conceive both by means
of similar terms, nor seek in the idea of their nature for the same distinguishing marks in
things that are thus separated. Accordingly, as the nature that is in the creation, as the phrase
of the most excellent Wisdom somewhere tells us, exhibits “the beginning, ending, and
midst of the times894” in itself, and extends concurrently with all temporal intervals, we
take as a sort of characteristic of the subject this property, that in it we see some beginning
of its formation, look on its midst, and extend our expectations to its end. For we have learnt
that the heaven and the earth were not from eternity, and will not last to eternity, and thus
it is hence clear that those things are both started from some beginning, and will surely cease
at some end. But the Divine Nature, being limited in no respect, but passing all limitations
on every side in its infinity, is far removed from those marks which we find in creation. For
that power which is without interval, without quantity, without circumscription, having in
itself all the ages and all the creation that has taken place in them, and over-passing at all
points, by virtue of the infinity of its own nature, the unmeasured extent of the ages, either
has no mark which indicates its nature, or has one of an entirely different sort, and not that
which the creation has. Since, then, it belongs to the creation to have a beginning, that will
be alien from the uncreated nature which belongs to the creation. For if any one should

<pb n="402"/>
venture to suppose the existence of the Only-begotten Son to be, like the creation, from any
beginning comprehensible by us, he must certainly append to his statement concerning the
Son the rest also of the sequence895; for it is not possible to avoid acknowledging, together
with the beginning, that also which follows from it. For just as if one were to admit some
person to be a man in all896 the properties of his nature, he would observe that in this confession
he declared him to be an animal and rational, and whatever else is conceived of man,
so by the same reasoning, if we should understand any of the properties of creation to be
present in the Divine essence, it will no longer be open to us to refrain from attaching to
that pure Nature the rest of the list of the attributes contemplated therein. For the “beginning”
will demand by force and compulsion that which follows it; for the “beginning,” thus conceived,
is a beginning of what comes after it, in such a sense, that if they are, it is, and if the
things connected with it are removed, the antecedent also would not remain897. Now as the
book of Wisdom speaks of “midst” and “end” as well as of “beginning,” if we assume in the
Nature of the Only-begotten, according to the heretical dogma, some beginning of existence
defined by a certain mark of time, the book of Wisdom will by no means allow us to refrain
from subjoining to the “beginning” a “midst” and an “end” also. If this should be done we
shall find, as the result of our arguments, that the Divine word shows us that the Deity is
mortal. For if, according to the book of Wisdom, the “end” is a necessary consequence of
the “beginning,” and the idea of “midst” is involved in that of extremes, he who allows one
of these also potentially maintains the others, and lays down bounds of measure and limitation
for the infinite Nature. And if this is impious and absurd, the giving a beginning to
that argument which ends in impiety deserves equal, or even greater censure; and the beginning
of this absurd doctrine was seen to be the supposition that the life of the Son was circumscribed
by some beginning. Thus one of two courses is before them: either they must
revert to sound doctrine under the compulsion of the foregoing arguments, and contemplate
Him Who is of the Father in union with the Father’s eternity, or if they do not like this, they
must limit the eternity of the Son in both ways, and reduce the limitless character of His life
to non-existence by a beginning and an end. And, granted that the nature both of souls and
of the angels has no end, and is no way hindered from going on to eternity, by the fact of

its being created, and having the beginning of its existence from some point of time, so that
our adversaries can use this fact to assert a parallel in the case of Christ, in the sense that
He is not from eternity, and yet endures everlastingly,—let any one who advances this argument
also consider the following point, how widely the Godhead differs from the creation
in its special attributes. For to the Godhead it properly belongs to lack no conceivable thing
which is regarded as good, while the creation attains excellence by partaking in something
better than itself; and further, not only had a beginning of its being, but also is found to be
constantly in a state of beginning to be in excellence, by its continual advance in improvement,
since it never halts at what it has reached, but all that it has acquired898 becomes by
participation a beginning of its ascent to something still greater, and it never ceases, in Paul’s
phrase, “reaching forth to the things that are before,” and “forgetting the things that are
behind899.” Since, then, the Godhead is very life, and the Only-begotten God is God, and
life, and truth, and every conceivable thing that is lofty and Divine, while the creation draws
from Him its supply of good, it may hence be evident that if it is in life by partaking of life,
it will surely, if it ceases from this participation, cease from life also. If they dare, then, to
say also of the Only-begotten God those things which it is true to say of the creation, let
them say this too, along with the rest, that He has a beginning of His being like the creation,
and abides in life after the likeness of souls. But if He is the very life, and needs not to have
life in Himself ab extra, while all other things are not life, but are merely participants in life,
what constrains us to cancel, by reason of what we see in creation, the eternity of the Son?
For that which is always unchanged as regards its nature, admits of no contrary, and is incapable
of change to any other condition: while things whose nature is on the boundary line
have a tendency that shifts either way, inclining at will to what they find attractive900. If,
then, that which is truly life is contemplated in the Divine and transcendent nature, the
decadence thereof will surely, as it seems, end in the opposite state901.</p>
<p>Now the meaning of “life” and “death” is manifold, and not always understood in the
same way. For as regards the flesh, the energy and motion of the bodily senses is called “life,”
and their extinction and dissolution is named “death.” But in the case of the intellectual
nature, approximation to the Divine is the true life, and decadence therefrom is named
“death”: for which reason the original evil, the devil, is called both “death,” and the inventor

of death: and he is also said by the Apostle to have the power of death902. As, then, we obtain,
as has been said, from the Scriptures, a twofold conception of death, He Who is truly unchangeable
and immutable “alone hath immortality,” and dwells in light that cannot be attained
or approached by the darkness of wickedness903: but all things that participate in
death, being far removed from immortality by their contrary tendency, if they fall away
from that which is good, would, by the mutability of their nature, admit community with
the worse condition, which is nothing else than death, having a certain correspondence with
the death of the body. For as in that case the extinction of the activities of nature is called
death, so also, in the case of the intellectual being, the absence of motion towards the good
is death and departure from life; so that what we perceive in the bodiless creation904 does
not clash with our argument, which refutes the doctrine of heresy. For that form of death
which corresponds to the intellectual nature (that is, separation from God, Whom we call
Life) is, potentially, not separated even from their nature; for their emergence from nonexistence
shows mutability of nature; and that to which change is in affinity is hindered
from participation in the contrary state by the grace of Him Who strengthens it: it does not
abide in the good by its own nature: and such a thing is not eternal. If, then, one really speaks
truth in saying that we ought not to estimate the Divine essence and the created nature in
the same way, nor to circumscribe the being of the Son of God by any beginning, lest, if this
be granted, the other attributes of creation should enter in together with our acknowledgment
of this one, the absurd character of the teaching of that man, who employs the attributes of
creation to separate the Only-begotten God from the eternity of the Father, is clearly shown.
For as none other of the marks which characterize the creation appears in the Maker of the
creation, so neither is the fact that the creation has its existence from some beginning a
proof that the Son was not always in the Father,—that Son, Who is Wisdom, and Power,
and Light, and Life, and all that is conceived of in the bosom of the Father.</p>

death: and that they may therefore be said to have an end, as they had a beginning: so far as they are eternal it
is not by their own power, but by their mutable nature being upheld by grace from this state of ἀκινησία πρὸς

<head>§1. The ninth book declares that Eunomius’ account of the Nature of God is, up to a certain
point, well stated. Then in succession he mixes up with his own argument, on account of
its affinity, the expression from Philo’s writings, “God is before all other things, which are
generated,” adding also the expression, “He has dominion over His own power.” Detesting
the excessive absurdity, Gregory strikingly confutes it905</head>
<p>But he now turns to loftier language, and elevating himself and puffing himself up with
empty conceit, he takes in hand to say something worthy of God’s majesty. “For God,” he
says, “being the most highly exalted of all goods, and the mightiest of all, and free from all
necessity—” Nobly does the gallant man bring his discourse, like some ship without ballast,
driven unguided by the waves of deceit, into the harbour of truth! “God is the most highly
exalted of all goods.” Splendid acknowledgment! I suppose he will not bring a charge of
unconstitutional conduct against the great John, by whom, in his lofty proclamation, the
Only-begotten is declared to be God, Who was with God and was God906. If he, then, the
proclaimer of the Godhead of the Only-begotten, is worthy of credit, and if “God is the most
highly exalted of all goods,” it follows that the Son is alleged by the enemies of His glory, to
be “the most highly exalted of all goods.” And as this phrase is also applied to the Father,
the superlative force of “most highly exalted” admits of no diminution or addition by way
of comparison. But, now that we have obtained from the adversary’s testimony these statements
for the proof of the glory of the Only-begotten, we must add in support of sound
doctrine his next statement too. He says, “God, the most highly exalted of all goods, being
without hindrance from nature, or constraint from cause, or impulse from need, begets and
creates according to the supremacy of His own authority, having His will as power sufficient
for the constitution of the things produced. If, then, all good is according to His will, He
not only determines that which is made as good, but also the time of its being good, if, that
is to say, as one may assume, it is an indication of weakness to make what one does not
will907.” We shall borrow so far as this, for the confirmation of the orthodox doctrines, from
our adversaries’ statement, percolated as that statement is by vile and counterfeit clauses.
Yes, He Who has, by the supremacy of His authority, power in His will that suffices for the
constitution of the things that are made, He Who created all things without hindrance from
nature or compulsion from cause, does determine not only that which is made as good, but

also the time of its being good. But He Who made all things is, as the gospel proclaims, the
Only-begotten God. He, at that time when He willed it, did make the creation; at that time,
by means of the circumambient essence, He surrounded with the body of heaven all that
universe that is shut off within its compass: at that time, when He thought it well that this
should be, He displayed the dry land to view, He enclosed the waters in their hollow places;
vegetation, fruits, the generation of animals, the formation of man, appeared at that time
when each of these things seemed expedient to the wisdom of the Creator:—and He Who
made all these things (I will once more repeat my statement) is the Only-begotten God Who
made the ages. For if the interval of the ages has preceded existing things, it is proper to
employ the temporal adverb, and to say “He then willed” and “He then made”: but since the
age was not, since no conception of interval is present to our minds in regard to that Divine
Nature which is not measured by quantity or by interval, the force of temporal expressions
must surely be void. Thus to say that the creation has had given to it a beginning in time,
according to the good pleasure of the wisdom of Him Who made all things, does not go
beyond probability: but to regard the Divine Nature itself as being in a kind of extension
measured by intervals, belongs only to those who have been trained in the new wisdom.
What a point is this, embedded in his words, which I intentionally passed by in my eagerness
to reach the subject! I will now resume it, and read it to show our author’s cleverness.</p>
<p>“For He Who is most highly exalted in God Himself908 before all other things that are
generated,” he says, “has dominion over His own power.” The phrase has been transferred
by our pamphleteer word for word from the Hebrew Philo to his own argument, and Eunomius’
theft will be proved by Philo’s works themselves to any one who cares about it. I note
the fact, however, at present, not so much to reproach our speech-monger with the poverty
of his own arguments and thoughts, as with the intention of showing to my readers the close
relationship between the doctrine of Eunomius and the reasoning of the Jews. For this phrase
of Philo would not have fitted word for word into his argument had there not been a sort
of kindred between the intention of the one and the other. In the Hebrew author you may
find the phrase in this form: “God, before all other things that are generated”; and what
follows, “has dominion over His own power,” is an addition of the new Judaism. But what
an absurdity this involves an examination of the saying will clearly show. “God,” he says,
“has dominion over His own power.” Tell me, what is He? over what has He dominion? Is

savours more of Philo than of Eunomius: but it is worth noting that S. Gregory does not dwell upon this part
of the clause as being borrowed from Philo (though he may intend to include it in the general statement), but
upon what follows it: and from his citation from Philo it would seem that the latter spoke (not of ὁ ἐξοχώτατος

He something else than His own power, and Lord of a power that is something else than
Himself? Then power is overcome by the absence of power. For that which is something
else than power is surely not power, and thus He is found to have dominion over power just
in so far as He is not power. Or again, God, being power, has another power in Himself,
and has dominion over the one by the other. And what contest or schism is there, that God
should divide the power that exists in Himself, and overthrow one section of His power by
the other. I suppose He could not have dominion over His own power without the assistance
to that end of some greater and more violent power! Such is Eunomius’ God: a being with
double nature, or composite, dividing Himself against Himself, having one power out of
harmony with another, so that by one He is urged to disorder, and by the other restrains
this discordant motion. Again, with what intent does He dominate the power that urges on
to generation? lest some evil should arise if generation be not hindered? or rather let him
explain this in the first place,—what is that which is naturally under dominion? His language
points to some movement of impulse and choice, considered separately and independently.
For that which dominates must needs be one thing, that which is dominated another. Now
God “has dominion over His power”—and this is—what? a self-determining nature? or
something else than this, pressing on to disquiet, or remaining in a state of quiescence?
Well, if he supposes it to be quiescent, that which is tranquil needs no one to have dominion
over it: and if he says “He has dominion,” He “has dominion” clearly over something which
impels and is in motion: and this, I presume he will say, is something naturally different
from Him Who rules it. What then, let him tell us, does he understand in this idea? Is it
something else besides God, considered as having an independent existence? How can another
existence be in God? Or is it some condition in the Divine Nature considered as having
an existence not its own? I hardly think he would say so: for that which has no existence of
its own is not: and that which is not, is neither under dominion, nor set free from it. What
then is that power which was under dominion, and was restrained in respect of its own
activity, while the due time of the generation of Christ was still about to come, and to set
this power free to proceed to its natural operation? What was the intervening cause of delay,
for which God deferred the generation of the Only-begotten, not thinking it good as yet to
become a Father? And what is this that is inserted as intervening between the life of the
Father and that of the Son, that is not time nor space, nor any idea of extension, nor any
like thing? To what purpose is it that this keen and clear-sighted eye marks and beholds the
separation of the life of God in regard to the life of the Son? When he is driven in all directions
he is himself forced to admit that the interval does not exist at all.</p>

<head>§2. He then ingeniously shows that the generation of the Son is not according to the phrase of
Eunomius, “The Father begat Him at that time when He chose, and not before:” but that
the Son, being the fulness of all that is good and excellent, is always contemplated in the
Father; using for this demonstration the support of Eunomius’ own arguments.</head>
<p>However, though there is no interval between them, he does not admit that their communion
is immediate and intimate, but condescends to the measure of our knowledge, and
converses with us in human phrase as one of ourselves, himself quietly confessing the impotence
of reasoning and taking refuge in a line of argument that was never taught by Aristotle
and his school. He says, “It was good and proper that He should beget His Son at that
time when He willed: and in the minds of sensible men there does not hence arise any
questioning why He did not do so before.” What does this mean, Eunomius? Are you too
going afoot like us unlettered men? are you leaving your artistic periods and actually taking
refuge in unreasoning assent? you, who so much reproached those who take in hand to
write without logical skill? You, who say to Basil, “You show your own ignorance when you
say that definitions of the terms that express things spiritual are an impossibility for men,”
who again elsewhere advance the same charge, “you make your own impotence common
to others, when you declare that what is not possible for you is impossible for all”? Is this
the way that you, who say such things as these, approach the ears of him who questions
about the reason why the Father defers becoming the Father of such a Son? Do you think
it an adequate explanation to say, “He begat Him at that time when He chose: let there be
no questioning on this point”? Has your apprehensive fancy grown so feeble in the maintenance
of your doctrines? What has become of your premises that lead to dilemmas? What
has become of your forcible proofs? how comes it that those terrible and inevitable syllogistic
conclusions of your art have dissolved into vanity and nothingness? “He begat the Son at
that time when He chose: let there be no questioning on this point!” Is this the finished
product of your many labours, of your voluminous undertakings? What was the question
asked? “If it is good and fitting for God to have such a Son, why are we not to believe that
the good is always present with Him909?” What is the answer he makes to us from the very
shrine of his philosophy, tightening the bonds of his argument by inevitable necessity? “He
made the Son at that time when He chose: let there be no questioning as to why He did not
do so before.” Why, if the inquiry before us were concerning some irrational being, that
acts by natural impulse, why it did not sooner do whatever it may be,—why the spider did
not make her webs, or the bee her honey, or the turtle-dove her nest,—what else could you
have said? would not the same answer have been ready—“She did it at that time when she
chose: let there be no questioning on this matter”? Nay, if it were concerning some sculptor
or painter who works in paintings or in sculptures by his imitative art, whatever it may be

<pb n="409"/>
(supposing that he exercises his art without being subject to any authority), I imagine that
such an answer would meet the case of any one who wished to know why he did not exercise
his art sooner,—that, being under no necessity, he made his own choice the occasion of his
operation. For men, because they do not always wish the same things910, and commonly
have not power co-operating with their will, do something which seems good to them at
that time when their choice inclines to the work, and they have no external hindrance. But
that nature which is always the same, to which no good is adventitious, in which all that
variety of plans which arises by way of opposition, from error or from ignorance, has no
place, to which there comes nothing as a result of change, which was not with it before, and
by which nothing is chosen afterwards which it had not from the beginning regarded as
good,—to say of this nature that it does not always possess what is good, but afterwards
chooses to have something which it did not choose before,—this belongs to wisdom that
surpasses us. For we were taught that the Divine. Nature is at all times full of all good, or
rather is itself the fulness of all goods, seeing that it needs no addition for its perfecting, but
is itself by its own nature the perfection of good. Now that which is perfect is equally remote
from addition and from diminution; and therefore, we say that perfection of goods which
we behold in the Divine Nature always remains the same, as, in whatsoever direction we
extend our thoughts, we there apprehend it to be such as it is. The Divine Nature, then, is
never void of good: but the Son is the fulness of all good: and accordingly He is at all times
contemplated in that Father Whose Nature is perfection in all good. But he says, “let there
be no questioning about this point, why He did not do so before:” and we shall answer
him,—“It is one thing, most sapient sir, to lay down as an ordinance some proposition that
you happen to approve911, and another to make converts by reasoning on the points of
controversy. So long, therefore, as you cannot assign any reason why we may piously say
that the Son was “afterwards” begotten by the Father, your ordinances will be of no effect
with sensible men.”</p>
<p>Thus it is then that Eunomius brings the truth to light for us as the result of his scientific
attack. And we for our part shall apply his argument, as we are wont to do, for the establish-
ment of the true doctrine, so that even by this passage it may be clear that at every point,
constrained against their will, they advocate our view. For if, as our opponent says, “He
begat the Son at that time when He chose,” and if He always chose that which is good, and
His power coincided with His choice, it follows that the Son will be considered as always
with the Father, Who always both chooses that which is excellent, and is able to possess
what He chooses. And if we are to reduce his next words also to truth, it is easy for us to

adapt them also to the doctrine we hold:—“Let there be no questioning among sensible men
on this point, why He did not do so before”—for the word “before” has a temporal sense,
opposed to what is “afterwards” and “later”: but on the supposition that time does not exist,
the terms expressing temporal interval are surely abolished with it. Now the Lord was before
times and before ages: questioning as to “before” or “after” concerning the Maker of the
ages is useless in the eyes of reasonable men: for words of this class are devoid of all meaning,
if they are not used in reference to time. Since then the Lord is antecedent to times, the
words “before” and “after” have no place as applied to Him. This may perhaps be sufficient
to refute arguments that need no one to overthrow them, but fall by their own feebleness.
For who is there with so much leisure that he can give himself up to such an extent to listen
to the arguments on the other side, and to our contention against the silly stuff? Since,
however, in men prejudiced by impiety, deceit is like some ingrained dye, hard to wash out,
and deeply burned in upon their hearts, let us spend yet a little time upon our argument, if
haply we may be able to cleanse their souls from this evil stain. After the utterances that I
have quoted, and after adding to them, in the manner of his teacher Prunicus,912 some unconnected
and ill-arranged octads of insolence and abuse, he comes to the crowning point
of his arguments, and, leaving the illogical exposition of his folly, arms his discourse once
more with the weapons of dialectic, and maintains his absurdity against us, as he imagines,
syllogistically.</p>
<note type="footnote">912 So in Book I. πρῶτον μὲν τῆς Προυνίκου σοφίας γίνεται μαθητὴς, and Book XIII. p. 844 (Paris Edit.). It
may be questioned whether the phrase in Books I. and XIII., and that here, refers to a supposed connection of
Eunomius with Gnosticism. The Προύνικος Σοφία of the Gnostics was a “male-female,” and hence the masculine

meaning to be attached to the word ὀκτάδας, which is also possibly borrowed from the Gnostic phraseology,
being akin to the form ὀγδοάδας. [On the Gnostic conception of “Prunicus,” see the note on the subject in

<head>§3. He further shows that the pretemporal generation of the Son is not the subject of influences
drawn from ordinary and carnal generation, but is without beginning and without end,
and not according to the fabrications constructed by Eunomius, in ignorance of His power,
from the statements of Plato concerning the soul and from the sabbath rest of the Hebrews.</head>
<p>What he says runs thus:—“As all generation is not protracted to infinity, but ceases on
arriving at some end, those who admit the origination of the Son are absolutely obliged to
say that He then ceased being generated, and not to look incredulously on the beginning of
those things which cease being generated, and therefore also surely begin: for the cessation
of generation establishes a beginning of begetting and being begotten: and these facts cannot
be disbelieved, on the ground at once of nature itself and of the Divine laws913.” Now since
he endeavours to establish his point inferentially, laying down his universal proposition
according to the scientific method of those who are skilled in such matters, and including
in the general premise the proof of the particular, let us first consider his universal, and then
proceed to examine the force of his inferences. Is it a reverent proceeding to draw from “all
generation” evidence even as to the pre-temporal generation of the Son? and ought we to
put forward ordinary nature as our instructor on the being of the Only-begotten? For my
own part, I should not have expected any one to reach such a point of madness, that any
such idea of the Divine and unsullied generation should enter his fancy. “All generation,”
he says, “is not protracted to infinity.” What is it that he understands by “generation”? Is
he speaking of fleshly, bodily birth, or of the formation of inanimate objects? The affections
involved in bodily generation are well known—affections which no one would think of
transferring to the Divine Nature. In order therefore that our discourse may not, by mentioning
the works of nature at length, be made to appear redundant, we shall pass such
matters by in silence, as I suppose that every sensible man is himself aware of the causes by
which generation is protracted, both in regard to its beginning and to its cessation: it would
be tedious and at the same time superfluous to express them all minutely, the coming together
of those who generate, the formation in the womb of that which is generated, travail, birth,
place, time, without which the generation of a body cannot be brought about,—things which
are all equally alien from the Divine generation of the Only-begotten: for if any one of these
things were admitted, the rest will of necessity all enter with it. That the Divine generation,
therefore, may be clear of every idea connected with passion, we shall avoid conceiving with
regard to it even that extension which is measured by intervals. Now that which begins and
ends is surely regarded as being in a kind of extension, and all extension is measured by
time, and as time (by which we mark both the end of birth and its beginning) is excluded,
it would be vain, in the case of the uninterrupted generation, to entertain the idea of end or
<note type="footnote">913 This quotation from Eunomius presents some difficulties, but it is quite as likely that they are due to the
obscurity of his style, as that they are due to corruption of the text.</note>

<pb n="412"/>
beginning, since no idea can be formed to mark either the point at which such generation
begins or that at which it ceases. If on the other hand it is the inanimate creation to which
he is looking, even in this case, in like manner, place, and time, and matter, and preparation,
and power of the artificer, and many like things, concur to bring the product to perfection.
And since time assuredly is concurrent with all things that are produced, and since with
everything that is created, be it animate or inanimate, there are conceived also bases of
construction relative to the product, we can find in these cases evident beginnings and
endings of the process of formation. For even the procuring of material is actually the beginning
of the fabric, and is a sign of place, and is logically connected with time. All these things
fix for the products their beginnings and endings; and no one could say that these things
have any participation in the pretemporal generation of the Only-begotten God, so that, by
the aid of the things now under consideration, we are able to calculate, with regard to that
generation, any beginning or end.</p>
<p>Now that we have so far discussed these matters, let us resume consideration of our
adversaries’ argument. It says, “As all generation is not protracted to infinity, but ceases on
arriving at some end.” Now, since the sense of “generation” has been considered with respect
to either meaning,—whether he intends by this word to signify the birth of corporeal beings,
or the formation of things created (neither of which has anything in common with the unsullied
Nature), the premise is shown to have no connection with the subject914. For it is
not a matter of absolute necessity, as he maintains, that, because all making and generation
ceases at some limit, therefore those who accept the generation of the Son should circumscribe
it by a double limit, by supposing, as regards it, a beginning and an end. For it is only as
being circumscribed in some quantitative way that things can be said either to begin or to
cease on arriving at a limit, and the measure expressed by time (having its extension concomitant
with the quantity of that which is produced) differentiates the beginning from the
end by the interval between them. But how can any one measure or treat as extended that
which is without quantity and without extension? What measure can he find for that which
has no quantity, or what interval for that which has no extension? or how can any one define
the infinite by “end” and “beginning?” for “beginning” and “end” are names of limits of
extension, and, where there is no extension, neither is there any limit. Now the Divine Nature
is without extension, and, being without extension, it has no limit; and that which is limitless
is infinite, and is spoken of accordingly. Thus it is idle to try to circumscribe the infinite by
“beginning” and “ending”—for what is circumscribed cannot be infinite. How comes it,
then, that this Platonic Phædrus disconnectedly tacks on to his own doctrine those speculations
on the soul which Plato makes in that dialogue? For as Plato there spoke of “cessation
of motion,” so this writer too was eager to speak of “cessation of generation,” in order to
<note type="footnote">914 i. e.with the subject of discussion, the generation of the Only-begotten.</note>

<pb n="413"/>
impose upon those who have no knowledge of these matters, with fine Platonic phrases.
“And these facts,” he tells us, “cannot be disbelieved, on the ground at once of nature itself
and of the Divine laws.” But nature, from our previous remarks, appears not to be trustworthy
for instruction as to the Divine generation,—not even if one were to take the universe itself
as an illustration of the argument: since through its creation also, as we learn in the cosmogony
of Moses, there ran the measure of time, meted out in a certain order and arrangement
by stated days and nights, for each of the things that came into being: and this even
our adversaries’ statement does not admit with regard to the being of the Only-begotten,
since it acknowledges that the Lord was before the times of the ages.</p>
<p>It remains to consider his support of his point by “the Divine laws,” by which he undertakes
to show both an end and a beginning of the generation of the Son. “God,” he says,
“willing that the law of creation should be impressed upon the Hebrews, did not appoint
the first day of generation for the end of creation, or to be the evidence of its beginning; for
He gave them as the memorial of the creation, not the first day of generation, but the seventh,
whereon He rested from His works.” Will any one believe that this was written by Eunomius,
and that the words cited have not been inserted by us, by way of misrepresenting his composition
so as to make him appear ridiculous to our readers, in dragging in to prove his
point matters that have nothing to do with the question? For the matter in hand was to
show, as he undertook to do, that the Son, not previously existing, came into being; and that
in being generated, He took a beginning of generation, and of cessation915,—His generation
being protracted in time, as it were by a kind of travail. And what is his resource for establishing
this? The fact that the people of the Hebrews, according to the Law, keep sabbath
on the seventh day! How well the evidence agrees with the matter in hand! Because the Jew
honours his sabbath by idleness, the fact, as he says, is proved that the Lord both had a beginning
of birth and ceased being born! How many other testimonies on this matter has
our author passed by, not at all of less weight than that which he employs to establish the
point at issue!—the circumcision on the eighth day, the week of unleavened bread, the
mystery on the fourteenth day of the moon’s course, the sacrifices of purification, the observation
of the lepers, the ram, the calf, the heifer, the scapegoat, the he-goat. If these things
are far removed from the point, let those who are so much interested in the Jewish mysteries
tell us how that particular matter is within range of the question. We judge it to be mean
and unmanly to trample on the fallen, and shall proceed to enquire, from what follows in
his writings, whether there is anything there of such a kind as to give trouble to his opponent.
All, then, that he maintains in the next passage, as to the impropriety of supposing anything
intermediate between the Father and the Son, I shall pass by, as being, in a sense, in agreement
<note type="footnote">915 The genitive ληξέως is rather awkward; it may be explained, however, as dependent upon ἀρχήν; “He
began to be generated: He began to cease being generated.”</note>

<pb n="414"/>
with our doctrine. For it would be alike undiscriminating and unfair not to distinguish in
his remarks what is irreproachable, and what is blamable, seeing that, while he fights against
his own statements, he does not follow his own admissions, speaking of the immediate
character of the connection while refusing to admit its continuity, and conceiving that
nothing was before the Son and having some suspicion that the Son was while yet contending
that He came into being when He was not. We shall spend but a short time on these points
(since the argument has already been established beforehand), and then proceed to handle
the arguments proposed.</p>
<p>It is not allowable for the same person to set nothing above the existence of the Onlybegotten,
and to say that before His generation He was not, but that He was generated then
when the Father willed. For “then” and “when” have a sense which specially and properly
refers to the denoting of time, according to the common use of men who speak soundly,
and according to their signification in Scripture. One may take “then shall they say among
the heathen916,” and “when I sent you917” and “then shall the kingdom of heaven be
likened918,” and countless similar phrases through the whole of Scripture, to prove this
point, that the ordinary Scriptural use employs these parts of speech to denote time. If
therefore, as our opponent allows, time was not, the signifying of time surely disappears
too: and if this did not exist, it will necessarily be replaced by eternity in our conception919.
For in the phrase “was not” there is surely implied “once”: as, if he should speak of “not
being,” without the qualification “once,” he would also deny his existence now: but if he
admits His present existence, and contends against His eternity, it is surely not “not being”
absolutely, but “not being” once which is present to his mind. And as this phrase is utterly
unreal, unless it rests upon the signification of time, it would be foolish and idle to say that
nothing was before the Son, and yet to maintain that the Son did not always exist. For if
there is neither place nor time, nor any other creature where the Word that was in the beginning
is not, the statement that the Lord “once was not” is entirely removed from the region
of orthodox doctrine. So he is at variance not so much with us as with himself, who declares
that the Only-begotten both was and was not. For in confessing that the conjunction of the
Son with the Father is not interrupted by anything, He clearly testifies to His eternity. But
if he should say that the Son was not in the Father, we shall not ourselves say anything
against such a statement, but shall oppose to it the Scripture which declares that the Son is

in the Father, and the Father in the Son, without adding to the phrase “once” or “when” or
“then,” but testifying His eternity by this affirmative and unqualified utterance.</p>

<head>§4. Then, having shown that Eunomius’ calumny against the great Basil, that he called the
Only-begotten “Ungenerate,” is false, and having again with much ingenuity discussed
the eternity, being, and endlessness of the Only-begotten, and the creation of light and of
darkness, he concludes the book.</head>
<p>With regard to his attempting to show that we say the Only-begotten God is ungenerate,
it is as though he should say that we actually define the Father to be begotten: for either
statement is of the same absurdity, or rather of the same blasphemous character. If, therefore,
he has made up his mind to slander us, let him add the other charge as well, and spare
nothing by which it may be in his power more violently to exasperate his hearers against
us. But if one of these charges is withheld because its calumnious nature is apparent, why
is the other made? For it is just the same thing, as we have said, so far as the impiety goes,
to call the Son ungenerate and to call the Father generated. Now if any such phrase can be
found in our writings, in which the Son is spoken of as ungenerate, we shall give the final
vote against ourselves: but if he is fabricating false charges and calumnies at his pleasure,
making any fictitious statement he pleases to slander our doctrines, this fact may serve with
sensible men for an evidence of our orthodoxy, that while truth itself fights on our side, he
brings forward a lie to accuse our doctrine and makes up an indictment for unorthodoxy
that has no relation to our statements. To these charges, however, we can give a concise
answer. As we judge that man accursed who says that the Only-begotten God is ungenerate,
let him in turn anathematize the man who lays it down that He who was in the beginning
“once was not.” For by such a method it will be shown who brings his charges truly, and
who calumniously. But if we deny his accusations, if, when we speak of a Father, we understand
as implied in that word a Son also, and if, when we use the name “Son,” we declare
that He really is what He is called, being shed forth by generation from the ungenerate Light,
how can the calumny of those who persist that we say the Only-begotten is ungenerate fail
to be manifest? Yet we shall not, because we say that He exists by generation, therefore admit
that He “once was not.” For every one knows that the contradiction between “being” and
“not being” is immediate, so that the affirmation of one of these terms is absolutely the destruction
of the other, and that, just as “being” is the same in regard to every time at which
any of the things that “are” is supposed to have its existence (for the sky, and stars, and sun,
and the rest of the things that “are,” are not more in a state of being now than they were
yesterday, or the day before, or at any previous time), so the meaning of “not being” expresses
non-existence equally at every time, whether one speaks of it in reference to what is earlier
or to what is later. For any of the things that do not exist920 is no more in a state of “not
<note type="footnote">920 Reading τῶν μὴ ὑφεστώτων, as the sense seems to require, unless we connect τῶν ὑφεστώτων with οὐκ
ἔστιν. In this case the sense will be practically the same, but the sentence will be extremely involved. The point
which S. Gregory desires to enforce is that “not being,” or “non-existence,” is one and the same thing, whether</note>

<pb n="417"/>
being” now than if it were non-existent before, but the idea of “not being” is one applied to
that which “is not” at any distance of time. And for this reason, in speaking of living creatures,
while we use different words to denote the dissolution into a state of “not being” of that
which has been, and the condition of non-existence of that which has never had an entrance
into being, and say either that a thing has never come into being at all, or that which was
generated has died, yet by either form of speech we equally represent by our words “nonexistence.”
For as day is bounded on each side by night, yet the parts of the night which
bound it are not named alike, but we speak of one as “after night-fall,” and of the other as
“before dawn,” while that which both phrases denote is night, so, if any one looks on that
which is not in contrast to that which is, he will give different names to that state which is
antecedent to formation and to that which follows the dissolution of what was formed, yet
will conceive as one the condition which both phrases signify—the condition which is
antecedent to formation and the condition following on dissolution after formation. For
the state of “not being” of that which has not been generated, and of that which has died,
save for the difference of the names, are the same,—with the exception of the account which
we take of the hope of the resurrection. Now since we learn from Scripture that the Onlybegotten
God is the Prince of Life, the very life, and light, and truth, and all that is honourable
in word or thought, we say that it is absurd and impious to contemplate, in conjunction
with Him Who really is, the opposite conception, whether of dissolution tending to corruption,
or of non-existence before formation: but as we extend our thought in every direction
to what is to follow, or to what was before the ages, we nowhere pause in our conceptions
at the condition of “not being,” judging it to tend equally to impiety to cut short the Divine
being by non-existence at any time whatever. For it is the same thing to say that the immortal
life is mortal, that the truth is a lie, that light is darkness, and that that which is is not. He,
accordingly, who refuses to allow that He will at some future time cease to be, will also refuse
to allow that He “once was not,” avoiding, according to our view, the same impiety on either
hand: for, as no death cuts short the endlessness of the life of the Only-begotten, so, as we
look back, no period of nonexistence will terminate His life in its course towards eternity,
that that which in reality is may be clear of all community with that which in reality is not.
For this cause the Lord, desiring that His disciples might be far removed from this error
(that they might never, by themselves searching for something antecedent to the existence
of the Only-begotten, be led by their reasoning to the idea of non-existence), saith, “I am
in the Father, and the Father in Me921,” in the sense that neither is that which is not conceived
in that which is, nor that which is in that which is not. And here the very order of the phrase
<note type="footnote">it is regarded as past, present, or future, and that it is, in any of these aspects, an idea which we cannot without
impiety attach to the Divine Person of the Son.</note>
<note type="footnote">921 S. John xiv. 10</note>

<pb n="418"/>
explains the orthodox doctrine; for because the Father is not of the Son, but the Son of the
Father, therefore He says, “I am in the Father,” showing the fact that He is not of another
but of Him, and then reverses the phrase to, “and the Father in Me,” indicating that he who,
in his curious speculation, passes beyond the Son, passes also beyond the conception of the
Father: for He who is in anything cannot be found outside of that in which He is: so that
the man who, while not denying that the Father is in the Son, yet imagines that he has in
any degree apprehended the Father as external to the Son, is talking idly. Idle too are the
wanderings of our adversaries’ fighting about shadows touching the matter of “ungeneracy,”
proceeding without solid foundation by means of nonentities. Yet if I am to bring more
fully to light the whole absurdity of their argument, let me be allowed to spend a little longer
on this speculation. As they say that the Only-begotten God came into existence “later,”
after the Father, this “unbegotten” of theirs, whatever they imagine it to be, is discovered of
necessity to exhibit with itself the idea of evil. Who knows not, that, just as the non-existent
is contrasted with the existent, so with every good thing or name is contrasted the opposite
conception, as “bad” with “good,” “falsehood” with “truth,” “darkness” with “light,” and all
the rest that are similarly opposed to one another, where the opposition admits of no middle
term, and it is impossible that the two should co-exist, but the presence of the one destroys
its opposite, and with the withdrawal of the other takes place the appearance of its contrary?</p>
<p>Now these points being conceded to us, the further point is also clear to any one, that,
as Moses says darkness was before the creation of light, so also in the case of the Son (if,
according to the heretical statement, the Father “made Him at that time when He willed”),
before He made Him, that Light which the Son is was not; and, light not yet being, it is impossible
that its opposite should not be. For we learn also from the other instances that
nothing that comes from the Creator is at random, but that which was lacking is added by
creation to existing things. Thus it is quite clear that if God did make the Son, He made Him
by reason of a deficiency in the nature of things. As, then, while sensible light was still
lacking, there was darkness, and darkness would certainly have prevailed had light not come
into being, so also, when the Son “as yet was not,” the very and true Light, and all else that
the Son is, did not exist. For even according to the evidence of heresy, that which exists has
no need of coming into being; if therefore He made Him, He assuredly made that which
did not exist. Thus, according to their view, before the Son came into being, neither had
truth come into being, nor the intelligible Light, nor the fount of life, nor, generally, the
nature of any thing that is excellent and good. Now, concurrently with the exclusion of each
of these, there is found to subsist the opposite conception: and if light was not, it cannot be
denied that darkness was; and so with the rest,—in place of each of these more excellent
conceptions it is clearly impossible that its opposite did not exist in place of that which was
lacking. It is therefore a necessary conclusion, that when the Father, as the heretics say, “had
not as yet willed to make the Son,” none of those things which the Son is being yet existent,

<pb n="419"/>
we must say that He was surrounded by darkness instead of Light, by falsehood instead of
truth, by death instead of life, by evil instead of good. For He Who creates, creates things
that are not; “That which is,” as Eunomius says, “needs not generation”; and of those things
which are considered as opposed, the better cannot be non-existent, except by the existence
of the worse. These are the gifts with which the wisdom of heresy honours the Father, by
which it degrades the eternity of the Son, and ascribes to God and the Father, before the
“production” of the Son, the whole catalogue of evils!</p>
<p>And let no one think to rebut by examples from the rest of creation the demonstration
of the doctrinal absurdity which results from this argument. One will perhaps say that, as,
when the sky was not, there was no opposite to it, so we are not absolutely compelled to
admit that if the Son, Who is Truth, had not come into existence, the opposite did exist. To
him we may reply that to the sky there is no corresponding opposite, unless one were to say
that its non-existence is opposed to its existence. But to virtue is certainly opposed that
which is vicious (and the Lord is virtue); so that when the sky was not, it does not follow
that anything was; but when good was not, its opposite was; thus he who says that good was
not, will certainly allow, even without intending it, that evil was. “But the Father also,” he
says922, “is absolute virtue, and life, and light unapproachable, and all that is exalted in word
or thought: so that there is no necessity to suppose, when the Only-begotten Light was not,
the existence of that darkness which is His corresponding opposite.” But this is just what I
say, that darkness never was; for the light never “was not,” for “the light,” as the prophecy
says, “is always in the light923.” If, however, according to the heretical doctrine, the “ungenerate
light” is one thing, and the “generated light” another, and the one is eternal, while the
other comes into existence at a later time, it follows of absolute necessity that in the eternal
light we should find no place for the establishment of its opposite; (for if the light always
shines, the power of darkness has no place in it;) and that in the case of the light which
comes into being, as they say, afterwards, it is impossible that the light should shine forth
save out of darkness; and the interval of darkness between eternal light and that which arises
later will be clearly marked in every way.924 For there would have been no need of the
making of the later light, if that which was created had not been of utility for some purpose:
and the one use of light is that of the dispersion by its means of the prevailing gloom. Now
the light which exists without creation is what it is by nature by reason of itself; but the
created light clearly comes into being by reason of something else. It must be then that its
existence was preceded by darkness, on account of which the light was of necessity created,
<note type="footnote">922 The words are probably those of the imaginary objector; but they may be a citation from Eunomius.</note>
<note type="footnote">923 The reference is probably to Ps. xxxvi. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">924 i.e.the “later light” must have arisen from darkness; therefore darkness must have intervened between
the “eternal light” and the “later light.”</note>

<pb n="420"/>
and it is not possible by any reasoning to make plausible the view that darkness did not
precede the manifestation of the Only-begotten Light,—on the supposition, that is, that He
is believed to have been “made” at a later time. Surely such a doctrine is beyond all impiety!
It is therefore clearly shown that the Father of truth did not make the truth at a time when
it was not; but, being the fountain of light and truth, and of all good, He shed forth from
Himself that Only-begotten Light of truth by which the glory of His Person is expressly
imaged; so that the blasphemy of those who say that the Son was a later addition to God by
way of creation is at all points refuted.</p>

<p>Let us, however, keep to our subject. A little further on he contends against those who
acknowledge that human nature is too weak to conceive what cannot be grasped, and with
lofty boasts enlarges on this topic on this wise, making light of our belief on the matter in
these words:—“For it by no means follows that, if some one’s mind, blinded by malignity,
and for that reason unable to see anything in front or above its head, is but moderately
competent for the apprehension of truth, we ought on that ground to think that the discovery
of reality is unattainable by the rest of mankind.” But I should say to him that he who declares
that the discovery of reality is attainable, has of course advanced his own intellect by some
method and logical process through the knowledge of existent things, and after having been
trained in matters that are comparatively small and easily grasped by way of apprehension,
has, when thus prepared, flung his apprehensive fancy upon those objects which transcend
all conception. Let, then, the man who boasts that he has attained the knowledge of real
existence, interpret to us the real nature of the most trivial object that is before our eyes,
that by what is knowable he may warrant our belief touching what is secret: let him explain
by reason what is the nature of the ant, whether its life is held together by breath and respiration,
whether it is regulated by vital organs like other animals, whether its body has a
framework of bones, whether the hollows of the bones are filled with marrow, whether its
joints are united by the tension of sinews and ligaments, whether the position of the sinews
is maintained by enclosures of muscles and glands, whether the marrow extends along the

all ants do not crawl, nor are all winged, but some belong to the creatures that move along
the ground, while others are borne aloft in the air. Let him, then, who boasts that he has
grasped the knowledge of real existence, disclose to us awhile the nature of the ant, and then,
and not till then, let him discourse on the nature of the power that surpasses all understand-

ing. But if he has not yet ascertained by his knowledge the nature of the tiny ant, how comes
he to vaunt that by the apprehension of reason he has grasped Him Who in Himself controls
all creation, and to say that those who own in themselves the weakness of human nature,
have the perceptions of their souls darkened, and can neither reach anything in front of
them, nor anything above their head?</p>
<p>But now let us see what understanding he who has the knowledge of existent things
possesses beyond the rest of the world. Let us listen to his arrogant utterance:—“Surely it
would have been idle for the Lord to call Himself ‘the door,’ if there were none to pass
through to the understanding and contemplation of the Father, and it would have been idle
for Him to call Himself ‘the way,’ if He gave no facility to those who wish to come to the
Father. And how could He be a light, without lightening men, without illuminating the eye
of their soul to understand both Himself and the transcendent Light?” Well, if he were here
enumerating some arguments from his own head, that evade the understanding of the
hearers by their subtlety, there would perhaps be a possibility of being deceived by the ingenuity
of the argument, as his underlying thought frequently escapes the reader’s notice.
But since he alleges the Divine words, of course no one blames those who believe that their
inspired teaching is the common property of all. “Since then,” he says, “the Lord was named
‘a door,’ it follows from hence that the essence of God may be comprehended by man.” But
the Gospel does not admit of this meaning. Let us hear the Divine utterance itself. “I am the
door,” Christ says; “by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and
find pasture925.” Which then of these is the knowledge of the essence? For as several things
are here said, and each of them has its own special meaning, it is impossible to refer them
all to the idea of the essence, lest the Deity should be thought to be compounded of different
elements; and yet it is not easy to find which of the phrases just quoted can most properly
be applied to that subject. The Lord is “the door,” “By Me,” He says, “if any man enter in,
he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find pasture.” Are we to say926 “entrance”
of which he speaks in place of the essence of God, or “salvation” of those that enter in, or
“going out,” or “pasture,” or “finding”?—for each of these is peculiar in its significance, and
does not agree in meaning with the rest. For to get within appears obviously contrary to
“going out,” and so with the other phrases. For “pasture,” in its proper meaning, is one
thing, and “finding” another thing distinct from it. Which, then, of these is the essence of
the Father supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases that disagree
one with another in signification, intend to indicate by incompatible terms that Essence
which is simple and uncompounded. And how can the word hold good, “No man hath seen

God at any time927” and, “Whom no man hath seen nor can see928” and, “There shall no
man see the face of the Lord and live929” if to be inside the door, or outside, or the finding
pasture, denote the essence of the Father? For truly He is at the same time a “door of encompassing930”
and a “house of defence931” as David calls Him, and through Himself He receives
them that enter, and in Himself He saves those who have come within, and again by Himself
He leads them forth to the pasture of virtues, and becomes all things to them that are in the
way of salvation, that so He may make Himself that which the needs of each demand,—both
way, and guide, and “door of encompassing,” and “house of defence,” and “water of comfort932”
and “green pasture933” which in the Gospel He calls “pasture”: but our new divine
says that the Lord has been called “the door” because of the knowledge of the essence of the
Father. Why then does he not force into the same significance the titles, “Rock,” and “Stone,”
and “Fountain,” and “Tree,” and the rest, that so he might obtain evidence for his own theory
by the multitude of strange testimonies, as he is well able to apply to each of these the same
account which he has given of the Way, the Door, and the Light? But, as I am so taught by
the inspired Scripture, I boldly affirm that He Who is above every name has for us many
names, receiving them in accordance with the variety of His gracious dealings with us934,
being called the Light when He disperses the gloom of ignorance, and the Life when He
grants the boon of immortality, and the Way when He guides us from error to the truth; so
also He is termed a “tower of strength935,” and a “city of encompassing936,” and a fountain,
and a rock, and a vine, and a physician, and resurrection, and all the like, with reference to
us, imparting Himself under various aspects by virtue of His benefits to us-ward. But those
who are keen-sighted beyond human power, who see the incomprehensible, but overlook
what may be comprehended, when they use such titles to expound the essences, are positive
that they not only see, but measure Him Whom no man hath seen nor can see, but do not
with the eye of their soul discern the Faith, which is the only thing within the compass of

our observation, valuing before this the knowledge which they obtain from ratiocination.
Just so I have heard the sacred record laying blame upon the sons of Benjamin who did not
regard the law, but could shoot within a hair’s breadth937, wherein, methinks, the word exhibited
their eager pursuit of an idle object, that they were far-darting and dexterous aimers
at things that were useless and unsubstantial, but ignorant and regardless of what was
manifestly for their benefit. For after what I have quoted, the history goes on to relate what
befel them, how, when they had run madly after the iniquity of Sodom, and the people of
Israel had taken up arms against them in full force, they were utterly destroyed. And it seems
to me to be a kindly thought to warn young archers not to wish to shoot within a hair’sbreadth,
while they have no eyes for the door of the faith, but rather to drop their idle labour
about the incomprehensible, and not to lose the gain that is ready to their hand, which is
found by faith alone.</p>

<head>§2. He then wonderfully displays the Eternal Life, which is Christ, to those who confess Him
not, and applies to them the mournful lamentation of Jeremiah over Jehoiakim, as being
closely allied to Montanus and Sabellius.</head>
<p>But now that I have surveyed what remains of his treatise I shrink from conducting my
argument further, as a shudder runs through my heart at his words. For he wishes to show
that the Son is something different from eternal life, while, unless eternal life is found in the
Son, our faith will be proved to be idle, and our preaching to be vain, baptism a superfluity,
the agonies of the martyrs all for nought, the toils of the Apostles useless and unprofitable
for the life of men. For why did they preach Christ, in Whom, according to Eunomius, there
does not reside the power of eternal life? Why do they make mention of those who had believed
in Christ, unless it was through Him that they were to be partakers of eternal life?
“For the intelligence,” he says, “of those who have believed in the Lord, overleaping all
sensible and intellectual existence, cannot stop even at the generation of the Son, but speeds
beyond even this in its yearning for eternal life, eager to meet the First.” What ought I most
to bewail in this passage? that the wretched men do not think that eternal life is in the Son,
or that they conceive of the Person of the Only-begotten in so grovelling and earthly a
fashion, that they fancy they can mount in their reasonings upon His beginning, and so look
by the power of their own intellect beyond the life of the Son, and, leaving the generation
of the Lord somewhere beneath them, can speed onward beyond this in their yearning for
eternal life? For the meaning of what I have quoted is nothing else than this, that the human
mind, scrutinizing the knowledge of real existence, and lifting itself above the sensible and
intelligible creation, will leave God the Word, Who was in the beginning, below itself, just
as it has left below it all other things, and itself comes to be in Him in Whom God the Word
was not, treading, by mental activity, regions which lie beyond the life of the Son, there
searching for eternal life, where the Only-begotten God is not. “For in its yearning for
eternal life,” he says, “it is borne in thought, beyond the Son”—clearly as though it had not
in the Son found that which it was seeking. If the eternal life is not in the Son, then assuredly
He Who said, “I am the life938,” will be convicted of falsehood, or else He is life, it is true,
but not eternal life. But that which is not eternal is of course limited in duration. And such
a kind of life is common to the irrational animals as well as to men. Where then is the majesty
of the very life, if even the irrational creation share it? and how will the Word or Divine
Reason939 be the same as the Life, if this finds a home, in virtue of the life which is but
temporary, in irrational creatures? For if, according to the great John, the Word is Life940,
but that life is temporary and not eternal, as their heresy holds, and if, moreover, the tem-

porary life has place in other creatures, what is the logical consequence? Why, either that
irrational animals are rational, or that the Reason must be confessed to be irrational. Have
we any further need of words to confute their accursed and malignant blasphemy? Do such
statements even pretend to conceal their intention of denying the Lord? For if the Apostle
plainly says that what is not eternal is temporary941, and if these people see eternal life in
the essence of the Father alone, and if by alienating the Son from the Nature of the Father
they also cut Him off from eternal life, what is this but a manifest denial and rejection of
the faith in the Lord? while the Apostle clearly says that those who “in this life only have
hope in Christ are of all men most miserable942.” If then the Lord is life, but not eternal life,
assuredly the life is temporal, and but for a day, that which is operative only for the present
time, or else943 the Apostle bemoans those who have hope, as having missed the true life.</p>
<p>However, they who are enlightened in Eunomius’ fashion pass the Son by, and are carried
in their reasonings beyond Him, seeking eternal life in Him Who is contemplated as outside
and apart from the Only-begotten. What ought one to say to such evils as these,—save
whatever calls forth lamentation and weeping? Alas, how can we groan over this wretched
and pitiable generation, bringing forth a crop of such deadly mischiefs? In days of yore the
zealous Jeremiah bewailed the people of Israel, when they gave an evil consent to Jehoiakim
who led the way to idolatry, and were condemned to captivity under the Assyrians in requital
for their unlawful worship, exiled from the sanctuary and banished far from the inheritance
of their fathers. Yet more fitting does it seem to me that these lamentations be chanted when
the imitator of Jehoiakim draws away those whom he deceives to this new kind of idolatry,
banishing them from their ancestral inheritance,—I mean the Faith. They too, in a way
corresponding to the Scriptural record, are carried away captive to Babylon from Jerusalem
that is above,—that is from the Church of God to this confusion of pernicious doctrines,—
for944 Babylon means “confusion.” And even as Jehoiakim was mutilated, so this
man, having voluntarily deprived himself of the light of the truth, has become a prey to the
Babylonian despot, never having learned, poor wretch, that the Gospel enjoins us to behold
eternal life alike in the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Word has
thus spoken concerning the Father, that to know Him is life eternal945, and concerning the
Son, that every one that believeth on Him hath eternal life946, and concerning the Holy

Spirit, that to Him that hath received His grace it shall be a well of water springing up unto
eternal life947. Accordingly every one that yearns for eternal life when he has found the
Son,—I mean the true Son, and not the Son falsely so called—has found in Him in its entirety
what he longed for, because He is life and hath life in Himself948. But this man, so subtle in
mind, so keen-sighted of heart, does not by his extreme acuteness of vision discover life in
the Son, but, having passed Him over and left Him behind as a hindrance in the way to that
for which he searches he there seeks eternal life where he thinks the true Life not to be! What
could we conceive more to be abhorred than this for profanity, or more melancholy as an
occasion of lamentation? But that the charge of Sabellianism and Montanism should be repeatedly
urged against our doctrines, is much the same as if one should lay to our charge
the blasphemy of the Anomoeans. For if one were carefully to investigate the falsehood of
these heresies, he would find that they have great similarity to the error of Eunomius. For
each of them affects the Jew in his doctrine, admitting neither the Only-begotten God nor
the Holy Spirit to share the Deity of the God Whom they call “Great,” and “First.” For Whom
Sabellius calls God of the three names, Him does Eunomius term unbegotten: but neither
contemplates the Godhead in the Trinity of Persons. Who then is really akin to Sabellius
let the judgment of those who read our argument decide. Thus far for these matters.</p>

<head>§3. He then shows the eternity of the Son’s generation, and the inseparable identity of His essence
with Him that begat Him, and likens the folly of Eunomius to children playing with
sand.</head>
<p>But since, in what follows, he is active in stirring up the ill savour of his disgusting attempts,
whereby he tries to make out that the Only-begotten God “once was not,” it will be
well, as our mind on this head has been made pretty clear by our previous arguments, no
longer to plunge our argument also in what is likewise bad, except perhaps that it is not
unseasonable to add this one point, having selected it from the multitude. He says (some
one having remarked that “the property of not being begotten is equally associated with the
essence of the Father949”), “The argument proceeds by like steps to those by which it came
to a conclusion in the case of the Son.” The orthodox doctrine is clearly strengthened by
the attack of its adversaries, the doctrine, namely, that we ought not to think that not to be
begotten or to be begotten are identical with the essence950, but that these should be contemplated,
it is true, in the subject, while the subject in its proper definition is something
else beyond these, and since no difference is found in the subject, because the difference of
“begotten” and “unbegotten” is apart from the essence, and does not affect it, it necessarily
follows that the essence must be allowed to be in both Persons without variation. Let us
moreover inquire, over and above what has been already said, into this point, in what sense
he says that “generation” is alien from the Father,—whether he does so conceiving of it as
an essence or an operation. If he conceives it to be an operation, it is clearly equally connected
with its result and with its author, as in every kind of production one may see the operation
alike in the product and the producer, appearing in the production of the effects and not
separated from their artificer. But if he terms “generation” an essence separate from the essence
of the Father, admitting that the Lord came into being therefrom, then he plainly puts
this in the place of the Father as regards the Only-begotten, so that two Fathers are conceived
in the case of the Son, one a Father in name alone, Whom he calls “the Ungenerate,” Who
has nothing to do with generation, and the other, which he calls “generation,” performing
the part of a Father to the Only-begotten.</p>
<p>And this is brought home even more by the statements of Eunomius himself than by
our own arguments. For in what follows, he says:—“God, being without generation, is also
prior to that which is generate,” and a little further on, “for He Whose existence arises from
being generated did not exist before He was generated.” Accordingly, if the Father has
<note type="footnote">949 Presumably the quotation from the unknown author, if completed, would run, “as that of being begotten
is associated with the essence of the Son.”</note>
<note type="footnote">950 If the property of not being begotten is “associated with” the essence, it clearly cannot be the essence, as
Eunomius elsewhere maintains it to be: hence the phrase which he here adopts concedes S. Gregory’s position
on this point.</note>

<pb n="429"/>
nothing to do with generation, and if it is from generation that the Son derives His being,
then the Father has no action in respect of the subsistence of the Son, and is apart from all
connection with generation, from which the Son draws His being. If, then, the Father is
alien from the generation of the Son, they either invent for the Son another Father under
the name of “generation,” or in their wisdom make out the Son to be self-begotten and selfgenerated.
You see the confusion of mind of the man who exhibits his ignorance to us up
and down in his own argument, how his profanity wanders in many paths, or rather in
places where no path is, without advancing to its mark by any trustworthy guidance; and
as one may see in the case of infants, when in their childish sport they imitate the building
of houses with sand, that what they build is not framed on any plan, or by any rules of art,
to resemble the original, but first they make something at haphazard, and in silly fashion,
and then take counsel what to call it,—this penetration I discern in our author. For after
getting together words of impiety according to what first comes into his head, like a heap
of sand, he begins to cast about to see whither his unintelligible profanity tends, growing
up as it does spontaneously from what he has said, without any rational sequence. For I do
not imagine that he originally proposed to invent generation as an actual subsistence
standing to the essence of the Son in the place of the Father, nor that it was part of our
rhetorician’s plan that the Father should be considered as alien from the generation of the
Son, nor was the absurdity of self-generation deliberately introduced. But all such absurdities
have been emitted by our author without reflection, so that, as regards them, the man who
so blunders is not even worth much refutation, as he knows, to borrow the Apostle’s words,
“neither what he says, nor whereof he affirms951.”</p>
<p>“For He Whose existence arises from generation,” he says, “did not exist before generation.”
If he here uses the term “generation” of the Father, I agree with Him, and there is no
opponent. For one may mean the same thing by either phrase, by saying either that Abraham
begat Isaac, or, that Abraham was the father of Isaac. Since then to be father is the same as
to have begotten, if any one shifts the words from one form of speech to the other, paternity
will be shown to be identical with generation. If, therefore, what Eunomius says is this, “He
Whose existence is derived from the Father was not before the Father,” the statement is
sound, and we give our vote in favour of it. But if he is recurring in the phrase to that generation
of which we have spoken before, and says that it is separated from the Father but associated
with the Son, then I think it waste of time to linger over the consideration of the unintelligible.
For whether he thinks generation to be a self-existent object, or whether by the
name he is carried in thought to that which has no actual existence, I have not to this day
been able to find out from his language. For his fluid and baseless argument lends itself alike
<note type="footnote">951 1 Tim. i. 7.</note>

to either supposition, inclining to one side or to the other according to the fancy of the

<head>§4. After this he shows that the Son, who truly is, and is in the bosom of the Father, is simple
and uncompounded, and that, He Who redeemed us from bondage is not under dominion
of the Father, nor in a state of slavery: and that otherwise not He alone, but also the
Father Who is in the Son and is One with Him, must be a slave; and that the word “being”
is formed from the word to “be.” And having excellently and notably discussed all these
matters, he concludes the book.</head>
<p>But not yet has the most grievous part of his profanity been examined, which the sequel
of his treatise goes on to add. Well, let us consider his words sentence by sentence. Yet I
know not how I can dare to let my mouth utter the horrible and godless language of him
who fights against Christ. For I fear lest, like some baleful drugs, the remnant of the pernicious
bitterness should be deposited upon the lips through which the words pass. “He that
cometh unto God,” says the Apostle, “must believe that He is952.” Accordingly, true existence
is the special distinction of Godhead. But Eunomius makes out Him Who truly is, either
not to exist at all, or not to exist in a proper sense, which is just the same as not existing at
all; for he who does not properly exist, does not really exist at all; as, for example, he is said
to “run” in a dream who in that state fancies he is exerting himself in the race, while, since
he untruly acts the semblance of the real race, his fancy that he is running is not for this
reason a race. But even though in an inexact sense it is so called, still the name is given to it
falsely. Accordingly, he who dares to assert that the Only-begotten God either does not
properly exist, or does not exist at all, manifestly blots out of his creed all faith in Him. For
who can any longer believe in something non-existent? or who would resort to Him Whose
being has been shown by the enemies of the true Lord to be improper and unsubstantial?</p>
<p>But that our statement may not be thought to be unfair to our opponents, I will set side
by side with it the language of the impious persons, which runs as follows:—“He Who is in
the bosom of the Existent, and Who is in the beginning and is with God, not being, or at all
events not being in a strict sense, even though Basil, neglecting this distinction and addition,
uses the title of ‘Existent’ interchangeably, contrary to the truth—” What do you say? that
He Who is in the Father is not, and that He Who is in the beginning, and Who is in the
bosom of the Father, is not, for this very reason, that He is in the beginning and is in the
Father, and is discerned in the bosom of the Existent, and hence does not in a strict sense
exist, because He is in the Existent? Alas for the idle and irrational tenets! Now for the first
time we have heard this piece of vain babbling,—that the Lord, by Whom are all things,
does not in a strict sense exist. And we have not yet got to the end of this appalling statement;
but something yet more startling remains behind, that he not only affirms that He does not
exist, or does not strictly speaking exist, but also that the Nature in which He is conceived
to reside is various and composite. For he says “not being, or not being simple.” But that to
<note type="footnote">952 Heb. xi. 6.</note>

<pb n="432"/>
which simplicity does not belong is manifestly various and composite. How then can the
same Person be at once non-existent and composite in essence? For one of two alternatives
they must choose: if they predicate of Him non-existence they cannot speak of Him as
composite, or if they affirm Him to be composite they cannot rob Him of existence. But
that their blasphemy may assume many and varied shapes, it jumps at every godless notion
when it wishes to contrast Him with the existent, affirming that, strictly speaking, He does
not exist, and in His relation to the uncompounded Nature denying Him the attribute of
simplicity:—“not existing, not existing simply, not existing in the strict sense.” Who among
those who have transgressed the word and forsworn the Faith was ever so lavish in utterances
denying the Lord? He has stood up in rivalry with the divine proclamation of John. For as
often as the latter has attested “was” of the Word, so often does he apply to Him Who is an
opposing “was not.” And he contends against the holy lips of our father Basil, bringing
against him the charge that he “neglects these distinctions,” when he says that He Who is
in the Father, and in the beginning, and in the bosom of the Father, exists, holding the view
that the addition of “in the beginning,” and “in the bosom of the Father,” bars the real existence
of Him Who is. Vain learning! What things the teachers of deceit teach! what strange
doctrines they introduce to their hearers! they instruct them that that which is in something
else does not exist! So, Eunomius, since your heart and brain are within you, neither of
them, according to your distinction, exists. For if the Only-begotten God does not, strictly
speaking, exist, for this reason, that He is in the bosom of the Father, then everything that
is in something else is thereby excluded from existence. But certainly your heart exists in
you, and not independently; therefore, according to your view, you must either say that it
does not exist at all, or that it does not exist in the strict sense. However, the ignorance and
profanity of his language are so gross and so glaring, as to be obvious even before our argument,
at all events to all persons of sense: but that his folly as well as his impiety may be
more manifest, we will add thus much to what has gone before. If one may only say that
that in the strict sense exists, of which the word of Scripture attests the existence detached
from all relation to anything else, why do they, like those who carry water, perish with thirst
when they have it in their power to drink? Even this man, though he had at hand the antidote
to his blasphemy against the Son, closed his eyes and ran past it as though fearing to be
saved, and charges Basil with unfairness for having suppressed the qualifying words, and
for only quoting the “was” by itself, in reference to the Only-Begotten. And yet it was quite
in his power to see what Basil saw and what every one who has eyes sees. And herein the
sublime John seems to me to have been prophetically moved, that the mouths of those
fighters against Christ might be stopped, who on the ground of these additions deny the
existence, in the strict sense, of the Christ, saying simply and without qualification “The
Word was God,” and was Life, and was Light953, not merely speaking of Him as being in
<note type="footnote">953 Cf. S. John i. 1, 4</note>

<pb n="433"/>
the beginning, and with God, and in the bosom of the Father, so that by their relation the
absolute existence of the Lord should be done away. But his assertion that He was God, by
this absolute declaration detached from all relation to anything else, cuts off every subterfuge
from those who in their reasonings run into impiety; and, in addition to this, there is
moreover something else which still more convincingly proves the malignity of our adversaries.
For if they make out that to exist in something is an indication of not existing in the
strict sense, then certainly they allow that not even the Father exists absolutely, as they have
learnt in the Gospel, that just as the Son abides in the Father, so the Father abides in the
Son, according to the words of the Lord954. For to say that the Father is in the Son is equi-
valent to saying that the Son is in the bosom of the Father. And in passing let us make this
further inquiry. When the Son, as they say, “was not,” what did the bosom of the Father
contain? For assuredly they must either grant that it was full, or suppose it to have been
empty. If then the bosom was full, certainly the Son was that which filled the bosom. But if
they imagine that there was some void in the bosom of the Father, they do nothing else than
assert of Him perfection by way of augmentation, in the sense that He passed from the state
of void and deficiency to the state of fulness and perfection. But “they knew not nor understood,”
says David of those that “walk on still in darkness955.” For he who has been rendered
hostile to the true Light cannot keep his soul in light. For this reason it was that they did
not perceive lying ready to their hand in logical sequence that which would have corrected
their impiety, smitten, as it were, with blindness, like the men of Sodom.</p>
<p>But he also says that the essence of the Son is controlled by the Father, his exact words
being as follows:—“For He Who is and lives because of the Father, does not appropriate
this dignity, as the essence which controls even Him attracts to itself the conception of the
Existent.” If these doctrines approve themselves to some of the sages “who are without,” let
not the Gospels nor the rest of the teaching of the Holy Scripture be in any way disturbed.
For what fellowship is there between the creed of Christians and the wisdom that has been
made foolish956? But if he leans upon the support of the Scriptures, let him show one such
declaration from the holy writings, and we will hold our peace. I hear Paul cry aloud, “There
is one Lord Jesus Christ957.” But Eunomius shouts against Paul, calling Christ a slave. For
we recognize no other mark of a slave than to be subject and controlled. The slave is assuredly
a slave, but the slave cannot by nature be Lord, even though the term be applied to Him by
inexact use. And why should I bring forward the declarations of Paul in evidence of the
lordship of the Lord? For Paul’s Master Himself tells His disciples that He is truly Lord, ac-

<pb n="434"/>
cepting as He does the confession of those who called Him Master and Lord. For He says,
“Ye call Me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am958.” And in the same way He enjoined
that the Father should be called Father by them, saying, “Call no man master upon
earth: for one is your Master, even Christ: and call no man father upon earth, for one is your
Father, Which is in heaven959.” To which then ought we to give heed, as we are thus hemmed
in between them? On one side the Lord Himself, and he who has Christ speaking in him960,
enjoin us not to think of Him as a slave, but to honour Him even as the Father is honoured,
and on the other side Eunomius brings his suit against the Lord, claiming Him as a slave,
when he says that He on Whose shoulders rests the government of the universe is under
dominion. Can our choice what to do be doubtful, or is the decision which is the more advantageous
course unimportant? Shall I slight the advice of Paul, Eunomius? shall I deem
the voice of the Truth less trustworthy than thy deceit? But “if I had not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had sin961.” Since then, He has spoken to them, truly declaring
Himself to be Lord, and that He is not falsely named Lord (for He says, “I am,” not “I am
called”), what need is there that they should do that, whereon the vengeance is inevitable
because they are forewarned?</p>
<p>But perhaps, in answer to this, he will again put forth his accustomed logic, and will say
that the same Being is both slave and Lord, dominated by the controlling power but lording
it over the rest. These profound distinctions are talked of at the cross-roads, circulated by
those who are enamoured of falsehood, who confirm their idle notions about the Deity by
illustrations from the circumstances of ordinary life. For since the occurrences of this world
give us examples of such arrangements962 (thus in a wealthy establishment one may see the
more active and devoted servant set over his fellow-servants by the command of his master,
and so invested with superiority over others in the same rank and station), they transfer this
notion to the doctrines concerning the Godhead, so that the Only-begotten God, though
subject to the sovereignty of His superior, is no way hindered by the authority of His sovereign
in the direction of those inferior to Him. But let us bid farewell to such philosophy,
and proceed to discuss this point according to the measure of our intelligence. Do they
confess that the Father is by nature Lord, or do they hold that He arrived at this position by
some kind of election? I do not think that a man who has any share whatever of intellect
could come to such a pitch of madness as not to acknowledge that the lordship of the God
of all is His by nature. For that which is by nature simple, uncompounded, and indivisible,

<pb n="435"/>
whatever it happens to be, that it is throughout in all its entirety, not becoming one thing
after another by some process of change, but remaining eternally in the condition in which
it is. What, then, is their belief about the Only-begotten? Do they own that His essence is
simple, or do they suppose that in it there is any sort of composition? If they think that He
is some multiform thing, made up of many parts, assuredly they will not concede Him even
the name of Deity, but will drag down their doctrine of the Christ to corporeal and material
conceptions: but if they agree that He is simple, how is it possible in the simplicity of the
subject to recognize the concurrence of contrary attributes? For just as the contradictory
opposition of life and death admits of no mean, so in its distinguishing characteristics is
domination diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to servitude. For if one were to consider
each of these by itself, one could not properly frame any definition that would apply alike
to both, and where the definition of things is not identical, their nature also is assuredly
different. If then the Lord is simple and uncompounded in nature, how can the conjunction
of contraries be found in the subject, as would be the case if servitude mingled with lordship?
But if He is acknowledged to be Lord, in accordance with the teaching of the saints, the
simplicity of the subject is evidence that He can have no part or lot in the opposite condition:
while if they make Him out to be a slave, then it is idle for them to ascribe to Him the title
of lordship. For that which is simple in nature is not parted asunder into contradictory attributes.
But if they affirm that He is one, and is called the other, that He is by nature slave
and Lord in name alone, let them boldly utter this declaration and relieve us from the long
labour of answering them. For who can afford to be so leisurely in his treatment of inanities
as to employ arguments to demonstrate what is obvious and unambiguous? For if a man
were to inform against himself for the crime of murder, the accuser would not be put to any
trouble in bringing home to him by evidence the charge of blood-guiltiness. In like manner
we shall no longer bring against our opponents, when they advance so far in impiety, a
confutation framed after examination of their case. For he who affirms the Only-begotten
to be a slave, makes Him out by so saying to be a fellow-servant with himself: and hence
will of necessity arise a double enormity. For either he will despise his fellow-slave and deny
the faith, having shaken off the yoke of the lordship of Christ, or he will bow before the
slave, and, turning away from the self-determining nature that owns no Lord over it, will
in a manner worship himself instead of God. For if he sees himself in slavery, and the object
of his worship also in slavery, he of course looks at himself, seeing the whole of himself in
that which he worships. But what reckoning can count up all the other mischiefs that necessarily
accompany this pravity of doctrine? For who does not know that he who is by nature
a slave, and follows his avocation under the constraint imposed by a master, cannot be removed
even from the emotion of fear? And of this the inspired Apostle is a witness, when
he says, “Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear963.” So that they will be
<note type="footnote">963 Rom. viii. 15.</note>

<pb n="436"/>
found to attribute, after the likeness of men, the emotion of fear also to their fellow-servant
God.</p>
<p>Such is the God of heresy. But what we, who, in the words of the Apostle, have been
called to liberty by Christ964, Who hath freed us from bondage, have been taught by the
Scriptures to think, I will set forth in few words. I take my start from the inspired teaching,
and boldly declare that the Divine Word does not wish even us to be slaves, our nature
having now been changed for the better, and that He Who has taken all that was ours, on
the terms of giving to us in return what is His, even as He took disease, death, curse, and
sin, so took our slavery also, not in such a way as Himself to have what He took, but so as
to purge our nature of such evils, our defects being swallowed up and done away with in
His stainless nature. As therefore in the life that we hope for there will be neither disease,
nor curse, nor sin, nor death, so slavery also along with these will vanish away. And that
what I say is true I call the Truth Himself to witness, Who says to His disciples “I call you
no more servants, but friends965.” If then our nature will be free at length from the reproach
of slavery, how comes the Lord of all to be reduced to slavery by the madness and infatuation
of these deranged men, who must of course, as a logical consequence, assert that He does
not know the counsels of the Father, because of His declaration concerning the slave, which
tells us that “the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth966”? But when they say this, let
them hear that the Son has in Himself all that pertains to the Father, and sees all things that
the Father doeth, and none of the good things that belong to the Father is outside the
knowledge of the Son. For how can He fail to have anything that is the Father’s, seeing He
has the Father wholly in Himself? Accordingly, if “the servant knoweth not what his lord
doeth,” and if He has in Himself all things that are the Father’s, let those who are reeling
with strong drink at last become sober, and let them now, if never before, look up at the
truth, and see that He who has all things that the Father has is lord of all, and not a slave.
For how can the personality that owns no lord over it bear on itself the brand of slavery?
How can the King of all fail to have His form of like honour with Himself? how can dishonour—
for slavery is dishonour—constitute the brightness of the true glory? and how is the
King’s son born into slavery? No, it is not so. But as He is Light of Light, and Life of Life,
and Truth of Truth, so is He Lord of Lord, King of King, God of God, Supreme of Supreme;
for having in Himself the Father in His entirety, whatever the Father has in Himself He also
assuredly has, and since, moreover, all that the Son has belongs to the Father, the enemies
of God’s glory are inevitably compelled, if the Son is a slave, to drag down to servitude the
Father as well. For there is no attribute of the Son which is not absolutely the Father’s. “For

<pb n="437"/>
all Mine are Thine,” He says, “and Thine are Mine967.” What then will the poor creatures
say? Which is more reasonable—that the Son, Who has said, “Thine are Mine, and I am
glorified in them968,” should be glorified in the sovereignty of the Father, or that insult
should be offered to the Father by the degradation involved in the slavery of the Son? For
it is not possible that He Who contains in Himself all that belongs to the Son, and Who is
Himself in the Son, should not also absolutely be in the slavery of the Son, and have slavery
in Himself. Such are the results achieved by Eunomius’ philosophy, whereby he inflicts upon
his Lord the insult of slavery, while he attaches the same degradation to the stainless glory
of the Father.</p>
<p>Let us however return once more to the course of his treatise. What does Eunomius say
concerning the Only-begotten? That He “does not appropriate the dignity,” for he calls the
appellation of “being” a “dignity.” A startling piece of philosophy! Who of all men that have
ever been, whether among Greeks or barbarian sages, who of the men of our own day, who
of the men of all time ever gave “being” the name of “dignity”? For everything that is regarded
as subsisting969 is said, by the common custom of all who use language, to “be”: and from
the word “be” has been formed the term “being.” But now the expression “dignity” is applied
in a new fashion to the idea expressed by “being.” For he says that “the Son, Who is and
lives because of the Father, does not appropriate this dignity,” having no Scripture to support
his statement, and not conducting his statement to so senseless a conclusion by any process
of logical inference, but as if he had taken into his intestines some windy food, he belches
forth his blasphemy in its crude and unmethodized form, like some unsavoury breath. “He
does not appropriate this dignity.” Let us concede the point of “being” being called “dignity.”
What then? does He Who is not appropriate being? “No,” says Eunomius, “because He exists
by reason of the Father.” Do you not then say that He Who does not appropriate being is
not? for “not to appropriate” has the same force as “to be alien from”, and the mutual opposition
of the ideas970 is evident. For that which is “proper” is not “alien,” and that which
is “alien” is not “proper.” He therefore Who does not “appropriate” being is obviously alien
from being: and He Who is alien from being is nonexistent.</p>
<p>But his cogent proof of this absurdity he brings forward in the words, “as the essence
which controls even Him attracts to itself the conception of the Existent.” Let us say nothing
about the awkwardness of the combination here: let us examine his serious meaning. What
argument ever demonstrated this? He superfluously reiterates to us his statement of the
Essence of the Father having sovereignty over the Son. What evangelist is the patron of this

<pb n="438"/>
doctrine? What process of dialectic conducts us to it. What premises support it? What line
of argument ever demonstrated by any logical consequence that the Only-begotten God is
under dominion? “But,” says he, “the essence that is dominant over the Son attracts to itself
the conception of the Existent.” What is the meaning of the attraction of the existent? and
how comes the phrase of “attracting” to be flung on the top of what he has said before? Assuredly
he who considers the force of words will judge for himself. About this, however, we
will say nothing: but we will take up again that argument that he does not grant essential
being to Him to Whom he does not leave the title of the Existent. And why does he idly
fight with shadows, contending about the non-existent being this or that? For that which
does not exist is of course neither like anything else, nor unlike. But while granting that He
is existent he forbids Him to be so called. Alas for the vain precision of haggling about the
sound of a word while making concessions on the more important matter! But in what sense
does He, Who, as he says, has dominion over the Son, “attract to Himself the conception
of the Existent”? For if he says that the Father attracts His own essence, this process of attraction
is superfluous: for existence is His already, without being attracted. If, on the other
hand, his meaning is that the existence of the Son is attracted by the Father, I cannot make
out how existence is to be wrenched from the Existent, and to pass over to Him Who “attracts”
it. Can he be dreaming of the error of Sabellius, as though the Son did not exist in
Himself, but was painted on to the personal existence of the Father? is this his meaning in
the expression that the conception of the Existent is attracted by the essence which exercises
domination over the Son? or does he, while not denying the personal existence of the Son,
nevertheless say that He is separated from the meaning conveyed by the term “the Existent”?
And yet, how can “the Existent” be separated from the conception of existence? For as long
as anything is what it is, nature does not admit that it should not be what it is.</p>

<head>§1. The eleventh book shows that the title of “Good” is due, not to the Father alone, as Eunomius,
the imitator of Manichæus and Bardesanes, alleges, but to the Son also, Who formed
man in goodness and loving-kindness, and reformed him by His Cross and Death.</head>
<p>Let us now go on to the next stage in his argument:—“<gap reason="omitted"/>.the Only-begotten Himself
ascribing to the Father the title due of right to Him alone. For He Who has taught us that
the appellation ‘good’ belongs to Him alone Who is the cause of His own971 goodness and
of all goodness, and is so at all times, and Who refers to Him all good that has ever come
into being, would be slow to appropriate to Himself the authority over all things that have
come into being, and the title of ‘the Existent.’” Well, so long as he concealed his blasphemy
under some kind of veil, and strove to entangle his deluded hearers unawares in the mazes
of his dialectic, I thought it necessary to watch his unfair and clandestine dealings, and as
far as possible to lay bare in my argument the lurking mischief. But now that he has stripped
his falsehood of every mask that could disguise it, and publishes his profanity aloud in categorical
terms, I think it superfluous to undergo useless labour in bringing logical modes
of confutation to bear upon those who make no secret of their impiety. For what further
means could we discover to demonstrate their malignity so efficacious as that which they
themselves show us in their writings ready to our hand? He says that the Father alone is
worthy of the title of “good,” that to Him alone such a name is due, on the plea that even
the Son Himself agrees that goodness belongs to Him alone. Our accuser has pleaded our
cause for us: for perhaps in my former statements I was thought by my readers to show a
certain wanton insolence when I endeavoured to demonstrate that the fighters against Christ
made Him out to be alien from the goodness of the Father. But I think it has now been
proved by the confession of our opponents that in bringing such a charge against them we
were not acting unfairly. For he who says that the title of “good” belongs of right to the
Father only, and that such an address befits Him alone, publishes abroad, by thus disclosing
his real meaning, the villainy which he had previously wrapped up in disguise. He says that
the title of “good” befits the Father only. Does he mean the title with the signification which
belongs to the expression, or the title detached from its proper meaning? If on the one side
he merely ascribes to the Father the title of “good” in a special sense, he is to be pitied for
his irrationality in allowing to the Father merely the sound of an empty name. But if he
thinks that the conception expressed by the term “good” belongs to God the Father only,
he is to be abominated for his impiety, reviving as he does the plague of the Manichæan
heresy in his own opinions. For as health and disease, even so goodness and badness exist
<note type="footnote">971 That is, of the Son’s goodness: for S. Gregory’s comment on the awkward use of the pronoun σφετέρας,
see p. 233, inf.</note>

<pb n="440"/>
on terms of mutual destruction, so that the absence of the one is the presence of the other.
If then he says that goodness belongs to the Father only, he cuts off these from every conceivable
object in existence except the Father, so that, along with all, the Only-begotten God
is shut out from good. For as he who affirms that man alone is capable of laughter implies
thereby that no other animal shares this property, so he who asserts that good is in the
Father alone separates all things from that property. If then, as Eunomius declares, the
Father alone has by right the title of “good,” such a term will not be properly applied to
anything else. But every impulse of the will either operates in accordance with good, or tends
to the contrary. For to be inclined neither one way nor the other, but to remain in a state of
equipoise, is the property of creatures inanimate or insensible. If the Father alone is good,
having goodness not as a thing acquired, but in His nature, and if the Son, as heresy will
have it, does not share in the nature of the Father, then he who does not share the good essence
of the Father is of course at the same time excluded also from part and lot in the title
of “good.” But he who has no claim either to the nature or to the name of “good”—what he
is assuredly not unknown, even though I forbear the blasphemous expression. For it is plain
to all that the object for which Eunomius is so eager is to import into the conception of the
Son a suspicion of that which is evil and opposite to good. For what kind of name belongs
to him who is not good is manifest to every one who has a share of reason. As he who is not
brave is cowardly, as he who is not just is unjust, and as he who is not wise is foolish, so he
who is not good clearly has as his own the opposite name, and it is to this that the enemy
of Christ wishes to press the conception of the Only-begotten, becoming thereby to the
Church another Manes or Bardesanes. These are the sayings in regard of which we say that
our utterance would be no more effective than silence. For were one to say countless things,
and to arouse all possible arguments, one could not say anything so damaging of our opponents
as what is openly and undisguisedly proclaimed by themselves. For what more bitter
charge could one invent against them for malice than that of denying that He is good “Who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God972,” but yet condescended
to the low estate of human nature, and did so solely for the love of man? In return
for what, tell me, “do ye thus requite the Lord973?” (for I will borrow the language of Moses
to the Israelites); is He not good, Who when thou wast soulless dust invested thee with
Godlike beauty, and raised thee up as an image of His own power endowed with soul? Is
He not good, Who for thy sake took on Him the form of a servant, and for the joy set before
Him974 did not shrink from bearing the sufferings due to thy sin, and gave Himself a ransom
for thy death, and became for our sakes a curse and sin?</p>

<head>§2. He also ingeniously shows from the passage of the Gospel which speaks of “Good Master,”
from the parable of the Vineyard, from Isaiah and from Paul, that there is not a dualism
in the Godhead of good and evil, as Eunomius’ ally Marcion supposes, and declares that
the Son does not refuse the title of “good” or “Existent,” or acknowledge His alienation
from the Father, but that to Him also belongs authority over all things that come into
being.</head>
<p>Not even Marcion himself, the patron of your opinions, supports you in this. It is true
that in common with you he holds a dualism of gods, and thinks that one is different in
nature from the other, but it is the more courteous view to attribute goodness to the God
of the Gospel. You however actually separate the Only-begotten God from the nature of
good, that you may surpass even Marcion in the depravity of your doctrines. However, they
claim the Scripture on their side, and say that they are hardly treated when they are accused
for using the very words of Scripture. For they say that the Lord Himself has said, “There
is none good but one, that is, God975.” Accordingly, that misrepresentation may not prevail
against the Divine words, we will briefly examine the actual passage in the Gospel. The history
regards the rich man to whom the Lord spoke this word as young—the kind of person, I
suppose, inclined to enjoy the pleasures of this life—and attached to his possessions; for it
says that he was grieved at the advice to part with what he had, and that he did not choose
to exchange his property for life eternal. This man, when he heard that a teacher of eternal
life was in the neighbourhood, came to him in the expectation of living in perpetual luxury,
with life indefinitely extended, flattering the Lord with the title of “good,”—flattering, I
should rather say, not the Lord as we conceive Him, but as He then appeared in the form
of a servant. For his character was not such as to enable him to penetrate the outward veil
of flesh, and see through it into the inner shrine of Deity. The Lord, then, Who seeth the
hearts, discerned the motive with which the young man approached Him as a suppliant,—that
he did so, not with a soul intently fixed upon the Divine, but that it was the man whom he
besought, calling Him “Good Master,” because he hoped to learn from Him some lore by
which the approach of death might be hindered. Accordingly, with good reason did He
Who was thus besought by him answer even as He was addressed976. For as the entreaty
was not addressed to God the Word, so correspondingly the answer was delivered to the
applicant by the Humanity of Christ, thereby impressing on the youth a double lesson. For
He teaches him, by one and the same answer, both the duty of reverencing and paying
homage to the Divinity, not by flattering speeches but by his life, by keeping the commandments
and buying life eternal at the cost of all possessions, and also the truth that humanity,
having been sunk in depravity by reason of sin, is debarred from the title of “Good”: and
<note type="footnote">975 Cf. S. Matt. xix. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">976 i.e.as man, and not as God.</note>

<pb n="442"/>
for this reason He says, “Why callest Thou Me good?” suggesting in His answer by the word
“Me” that human nature which encompassed Him, while by attributing goodness to the
Godhead He expressly declared Himself to be good, seeing that He is proclaimed to be God
by the Gospel. For had the Only-begotten Son been excluded from the title of God, it would
perhaps not have been absurd to think Him alien also from the appellation of “good.” But
if, as is the case, prophets, evangelists, and Apostles proclaim aloud the Godhead of the
Only-begotten, and if the name of goodness is attested by the Lord Himself to belong to
God, how is it possible that He Who is partaker of the Godhead should not be partaker of
the goodness too? For that both prophets, evangelists, disciples and apostles acknowledge
the Lord as God, there is none so uninitiated in Divine mysteries as to need to be expressly
told. For who knows not that in the forty-fourth977 Psalm the prophet in his word affirms
the Christ to be God, anointed by God? And again, who of all that are conversant with
prophecy is unaware that Isaiah, among other passages, thus openly proclaims the Godhead
of the Son, where he says: “The Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and shall
be servants unto thee: they shall come after thee bound in fetters, and in thee shall they make
supplication, because God is in thee, and there is no God beside thee; for thou art God978.”
For what other God there is Who has God in Himself, and is Himself God, except the Onlybegotten,
let them say who hearken not to the prophecy; but of the interpretation of Emmanuel,
and the confession of Thomas after his recognition of the Lord, and the sublime
diction of John, as being manifest even to those who are outside the faith, I will say nothing.
Nay, I do not even think it necessary to bring forward in detail the utterances of Paul, since
they are, as one may say, in all men’s mouths, who gives the Lord the appellation not only
of “God,” but of “great God” and “God over all,” saying to the Romans, “Whose are the
fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed
for ever979,” and writing to his disciple Titus, “According to the appearing of Jesus Christ
the great God and our Saviour980,” and to Timothy, proclaims in plain terms, “God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit981.” Since then the fact has been demonstrated
on every side that the Only-begotten God is God982, how is it that he who says that goodness
belongs to God, strives to show that the Godhead of the Son is alien from this ascription,

and this though the Lord has actually claimed for Himself the epithet “good” in the parable
of those who were hired into the vineyard? For there, when those who had laboured before
the others were dissatisfied at all receiving the same pay, and deemed the good fortune of
the last to be their own loss, the just judge says to one of the murmurers983, “Friend, I do
thee no wrong: did I not agree with thee for a penny a day? Lo, there thou hast that is thine984:
I will bestow upon this last even as upon thee. Have I not power to do what I will with mine
own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?” Of course no one will contest the point that to
distribute recompense according to desert is the special function of the judge; and all the
disciples of the Gospel agree that the Only-begotten God is Judge; “for the Father,” He saith,
“judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son985.” But they do not set
themselves in opposition986 to the Scriptures. For they say that the word “one” absolutely
points to the Father. For He saith, “There is none good but one, that is God.” Will truth
then lack vigour to plead her own cause? Surely there are many means easily to convict of
deception this quibble also. For He Who said this concerning the Father spake also to the
Father that other word, “All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in
them987.” Now if He says that all that is the Father’s is also the Son’s, and goodness is one
of the attributes pertaining to the Father, either the Son has not all things if He has not this,
and they will be saying that the Truth lies, or if it is impious to suspect the very Truth of
being carried away into falsehood, then He Who claimed all that is the Father’s as His own,
thereby asserted that He was not outside of goodness. For He Who has the Father in Himself,
and contains all things that belong to the Father, manifestly has His goodness with “all
things.” Therefore the Son is Good. But “there is none good,” he says, “but one, that is God.”
This is what is alleged by our adversaries: nor do I myself reject the statement. I do not,
however, for this cause deny the Godhead of the Son. But he who confesses that the Lord
is God, by that very confession assuredly also asserts of Him goodness. For if goodness is a
property of God, and if the Lord is God, then by our premises the Son is shown to be God.
“But,” says our opponent, “the word ‘one’ excludes the Son from participation in goodness.”
It is easy, however, to show that not even the word “one” separates the Father from the Son.
For in all other cases, it is true, the term “one” carries with it the signification of not being
coupled with anything else, but in the case of the Father and the Son “one” does not imply

kind of unity is contemplated in the Father and the Son, it follows that the Lord, in predicating

Who is one with the Father, and not severed from oneness of nature.</p>

<head>§3. He then exposes the ignorance of Eunomius, and the incoherence and absurdity of his arguments,
in speaking of the Son as “the Angel of the Existent,” and as being as much below
the Divine Nature as the Son is superior to the things created by Himself. And in this
connection there is a noble and forcible counter-statement and an indignant refutation,
showing that He Who gave the oracles to Moses is Himself the Existent, the Only-begotten
Son, Who to the petition of Moses, “If Thou Thyself goest not with us, carry me not up
hence,” said, “I will do this also that thou hast said”; Who is also called “Angel” both by
Moses and Isaiah: wherein is cited the text, “Unto us a Child is born.”</head>
<p>But that the research and culture of our imposing author may be completely disclosed,
we will consider sentence by sentence his presentment of his sentiments. “The Son,” he says,
“does not appropriate the dignity of the Existent,” giving the name of “dignity” to the actual
fact of being:—(with what propriety he knows how to adapt words to things!)—and since
He is “by reason of the Father,” he says that He is alienated from Himself on the ground
that the essence which is supreme over Him attracts to itself the conception of the Existent.
This is much the same as if one were to say that he who is bought for money, in so far as he
is in his own existence, is not the person bought, but the purchaser, inasmuch as his essential
personal existence is absorbed into the nature of him who has acquired authority over him.
Such are the lofty conceptions of our divine: but what is the demonstration of his statements?….“
the Only-begotten,” he says, “Himself ascribing to the Father the title due of right
to Him alone,” and then he introduces the point that the Father alone is good. Where in
this does the Son disclaim the title of “Existent”? Yet this is what Eunomius is driving at
when he goes on word for word as follows:—“For He Who has taught us that the appellation
‘good’ belongs to Him alone Who is the cause of His own goodness and of all goodness, and
is so at all times, and Who refers to Him all good that has ever come into being, would be
slow to appropriate to Himself the authority over all things that have come into being, and
the title of ‘the Existent.’” What has “authority” to do with the context? and how along with
this is the Son also alienated from the title of “Existent”? But really I do not know what one
ought rather to do at this,—to laugh at the want of education, or to pity the pernicious folly
which it displays. For the expression, “His own,” not employed according to the natural
meaning, and as those who know how to use language are wont to use it, attests his extensive
knowledge of the grammar of pronouns, which even little boys get up with their masters
without trouble, and his ridiculous wandering from the subject to what has nothing to do
either with his argument or with the form of that argument, considered as syllogistic, namely,
that the Son has no share in the appellation of “Existent”—an assertion adapted to his

<pb n="446"/>
monstrous inventions989,—this and similar absurdities seem combined together for the
purpose of provoking laughter; so that it may be that readers of the more careless sort experience
some such inclination, and are amused by the disjointedness of his arguments. But
that God the Word should not exist, or that He at all events should not be good (and this
is what Eunomius maintains when he says that He does not “appropriate the title” of “Existent”
and “good”), and to make out that the authority over all things that come into being
does not belong to him,—this calls for our tears, and for a wail of mourning.</p>
<p>For it is not as if he had but let fall something of the kind just once under some headlong
and inconsiderate impulse, and in what followed had striven to retrieve his error: no, he
dallies lingeringly with the malignity, striving in his later statements to surpass what had
gone before. For as he proceeds, he says that the Son is the same distance below the Divine
Nature as the nature of angels is subjected below His own, not indeed saying this in so many
words, but endeavouring by what he does say to produce such an impression. The reader
may judge for himself the meaning of his words: they run as follows,—“Who, by being called
‘Angel,’ clearly showed by Whom He published His words, and Who is the Existent, while
by being addressed also as God, He showed His superiority over all things. For He Who is
the God of all things that were made by Him, is the Angel of the God over all.” Indignation
rushes into my heart and interrupts my discourse, and under this emotion arguments are
lost in a turmoil of anger roused by words like these. And perhaps I may be pardoned for
feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be stirred within him at such profanity,
when he remembers how the Apostle proclaims that every angelic nature is subject
to the Lord, and in witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the prophets:—“
When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the angels
of God worship Him,” and, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,” and, “Thou art the
same, and Thy years shall not fail990”? When the Apostle has gone through all this argument
to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel
when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,—
and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength
to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no
superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, “This is he of whom
it is written, ‘Behold I send my angel before thy face991.’” John therefore is an angel. But the

enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to
be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was
constituted a god to the Egyptians992. And yet this phrase, “over all,” as has been previously
observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such
a title to Him, when he says, “Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God
over all993.” But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he
had not heard that the angels are “ministering spirits,” and “a flame of fire994.” For by the
use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several
subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be “spirits” and “fire,”
and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are
so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts
up his single voice, calling the Christ “an angel of the God over all,” defining Him, by thus
contrasting Him with the “God over all,” to be one of the “all things,” and, by giving Him
the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature:
for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be
different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who
proclaims in so many words that the “Angel” does not publish His own word, but that of
the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the
beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some
other Word, being its minister and “angel.” And who knows not that the only opposite to
the “Existent” is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is
clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten.
For in saying that He is excluded from the title of the “Existent,” he is assuredly trying to
establish also that He is outside the pale of existence: for surely if he grants Him existence,
he will not quarrel about the sound of the word.</p>
<p>But he strives to prop up his absurdity by the testimony of Scripture, and puts forth
Moses as his advocate against the truth. For as though that were the source from which he
drew his arguments, he freely sets forth to us his own fables, saying, “He Who sent Moses
was the Existent Himself, but He by Whom He sent and spake was the Angel of the Existent,
and the God of all else.” That his statement, however, is not drawn from Scripture, may be
conclusively proved by Scripture itself. But if he says that this is the sense of what is written,
we must examine the original language of Scripture. Moreover let us first notice that Eunomius,
after calling the Lord God of all things after Him, allows Him no superiority in comparison
with the angelic nature. For neither did Moses, when he heard that he was made a

god to Pharaoh995, pass beyond the bounds of humanity, but while in nature he was on an
equality with his fellows, he was raised above them by superiority of authority, and his being
called a god did not hinder him from being man. So too in this case Eunomius, while making
out the Son to be one of the angels, salves over such an error by the appellation of Godhead,
in the manner expressed, allowing Him the title of God in some equivocal sense. Let us once
more set down and examine the very words in which he delivers his blasphemy. “He Who
sent Moses was the Existent Himself, but He by Whom He sent was the Angel of the Existent”—
this, namely “Angel,” being the title he gives his Lord. Well, the absurdity of our author
is refuted by the Scripture itself, in the passage where Moses beseeches the Lord not to entrust
an angel with the leadership of the people, but Himself to conduct their march. The passage
runs thus: God is speaking, “Go, get thee down, guide this people unto the place of which
I have spoken unto thee: behold Mine Angel shall go before thee in the day when I visit996.”
And a little while after He says again, “And I will send Mine Angel before thee997.” Then,
a little after what immediately follows, comes the supplication to God on the part of His
servant, running on this wise, “If I have found grace in Thy sight, let my Lord go among
us998,” and again, “If Thou Thyself go not with us, carry me not up hence999”; and then the
answer of God to Moses, “I will do for thee this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou
hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee above all men1000.” Accordingly, if Moses
begs that the people may not be led by an angel, and if He Who was discoursing with him
consents to become his fellow-traveller and the guide of the army, it is hereby manifestly
shown that He Who made Himself known by the title of “the Existent” is the Only-begotten
God.</p>
<p>If any one gainsays this, he will show himself to be a supporter of the Jewish persuasion
in not associating the Son with the deliverance of the people. For if, on the one hand, it was
not an angel that went forth with the people, and if, on the other, as Eunomius would have
it, He Who was manifested by the name of the Existent is not the Only-begotten, this amounts
to nothing less than transferring the doctrines of the synagogue to the Church of God. Accordingly,
of the two alternatives they must needs admit one, namely, either that the Onlybegotten
God on no occasion appeared to Moses, or that the Son is Himself the “Existent,”
from Whom the word came to His servant. But he contradicts what has been said above,
alleging the Scripture itself1001 which informs us that the voice of an angel was interposed,

and that it was thus that the discourse of the Existent was conveyed. This, however, is no
contradiction, but a confirmation of our view. For we too say plainly, that the prophet,
wishing to make manifest to men the mystery concerning Christ, called the Self-Existent
“Angel,” that the meaning of the words might not be referred to the Father, as it would have
been if the title of “Existent” alone had been found throughout the discourse. But just as
our word is the revealer and messenger (or “angel”) of the movements of the mind, even so
we affirm that the true Word that was in the beginning, when He announces the will of His
own Father, is styled “Angel” (or “Messenger”), a title given to Him on account of the operation
of conveying the message. And as the sublime John, having previously called Him
“Word,” so introduces the further truth that the Word was God, that our thoughts might
not at once turn to the Father, as they would have done if the title of God had been put first,
so too does the mighty Moses, after first calling Him “Angel,” teach us in the words that
follow that He is none other than the Self-Existent Himself, that the mystery concerning
the Christ might be foreshown, by the Scripture assuring us by the name “Angel,” that the
Word is the interpreter of the Father’s will, and, by the title of the “Self-Existent,” of the
closeness of relation subsisting between the Son and the Father. And if he should bring
forward Isaiah also as calling Him “the Angel of mighty counsel1002,” not even so will he
overthrow our argument. For there, in clear and uncontrovertible terms, there is indicated
by the prophecy the dispensation of His Humanity; for “unto us,” he says, “a Child is born,
unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name is
called the Angel of mighty counsel.” And it is with an eye to this, I suppose, that David describes
the establishment of His kingdom, not as though He were not a King, but in the view
that the humiliation to the estate of a servant to which the Lord submitted by way of dispensation,
was taken up and absorbed into the majesty of His Kingdom. For he says, “I was established
King by Him on His holy hill of Sion, declaring the ordinance of the Lord.”1003
Accordingly, He Who through Himself reveals the goodness of the Father is called “Angel”
and “Word,” “Seal” and “Image,” and all similar titles with the same intention. For as the
“Angel” (or “Messenger”) gives information from some one, even so the Word reveals the
thought within, the Seal shows by Its own stamp the original mould, and the Image by Itself
interprets the beauty of that whereof It is the image, so that in their signification all these
terms are equivalent to one another. For this reason the title “Angel” is placed before that
of the “Self-Existent,” the Son being termed “Angel” as the exponent of His Father’s will,
and the “Existent” as having no name that could possibly give a knowledge of His essence,
but transcending all the power of names to express. Wherefore also His name is testified by

the writing of the Apostle to be “above every name1004,” not as though it were some one

that He Who verily is is above every name.</p>

<head>§4. After this, fearing to extend his reply to great length, he passes by most of his adversary’s
statements as already refuted. But the remainder, for the sake of those who deem them of
much force, he briefly summarizes, and refutes the blasphemy of Eunomius, who says of
the Lord also that He is what animals and plants in all creation are, non-existent before
their own generation; and so with the production of frogs; alas for the blasphemy!</head>
<p>But I must hasten on, for I see that my treatise has already extended beyond bounds,
and I fear that I may be thought garrulous and inordinate in my talk, if I prolong my answer
to excess, although I have intentionally passed by many parts of my adversary’s treatise, that
my argument might not be spun out to many myriads of words. For to the more studious
even the want of conciseness gives an occasion for disparagement; but as for those whose
mind looks not to what is of use, but to the fancy of those who are idle and not in earnest,
their wish and prayer is to get over as much of the journey as they can in a few steps. What
then ought we to do when Eunomius’ profanity draws us on? Are we to track his every turn?
or is it perhaps superfluous and merely garrulous to spend our energies over and over again
on similar encounters? For all their argument that follows is in accordance with what we
have already investigated, and presents no fresh point in addition to what has gone before.
If then we have succeeded in completely overthrowing his previous statements, the remainder
fall along with them. But in case the contentious and obstinate should think that the strongest
part of their case is in what I have omitted, for this reason it may perhaps be necessary to
touch briefly upon what remains.</p>
<p>He says that the Lord did not exist before His own generation—he who cannot prove
that He was in anything separated from the Father. And this he says, not quoting any
Scripture as a warrant for his assertion, but maintaining his proposition by arguments of
his own. But this characteristic has been shown to be common to all parts of the creation.
Not a frog, not a worm, not a beetle, not a blade of grass, nor any other of the most insignificant
objects, existed before its own formation: so that what by aid of his dialectic skill he
tries with great labour and pains to establish to be the case with the Son, has previously been
acknowledged to be true of any chance portions of the creation, and our author’s mighty
labour is to show that the Only-begotten God, by participation of attributes, is on a level
with the lowest of created things. Accordingly the fact of the coincidence of their opinions
concerning the Only-begotten God, and their view of the mode in which frogs come into
being, is a sufficient indication of their doctrinal pravity. Next he urges that not to be before
His generation, is equivalent in fact and meaning to not being ungenerate. Once more the
same argument will fit my hand in dealing with this too,—that a man would not be wrong
in saying the same thing of a dog, or a flea, or a snake, or any one you please of the meanest
creatures, since for a dog not to exist before his generation is equivalent in fact and meaning
to his not being ungenerate. But if, in accord with the definition they have so often laid
down, all things that share in attributes share also in nature, and if it is an attribute of the

<pb n="452"/>
dog, and of the rest severally, not to exist before generation, which is what Eunomius thinks
fit to maintain also of the Son, the reader will by logical process see for himself the conclusion
of this demonstration.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">

<head>§5. 1005Eunomius again speaks of the Son as Lord and God, and Maker of all creation intelligible
and sensible, having received from the Father the power and the commission for
creation, being entrusted with the task of creation as if He were an artizan commissioned
by some one hiring Him, and receiving His power of creation as a thing adventitious, ab
extra, as a result of the power allotted to Him in accordance with such and such combinations
and positions of the stars, as destiny decrees their lot in life to men at their nativity.
Thus, passing by most of what Eunomius had written, he confutes his blasphemy that the
Maker of all things came into being in like manner with the earth and with angels, and
that the subsistence of the Only-begotten differs not at all from the genesis of all things,
and reproaches Him with reverencing neither the Divine mystery nor the custom of the
Church, nor following in his attempt to discover godliness any teacher of pious doctrine,
but Manichæus, Colluthus, Arius, Aetius, and those like to them, supposing that Chris-
tianity in general is folly, and that the customs of the Church and the venerable sacraments
are a jest, wherein he differs in nothing from the pagans, who borrowed from our doctrine
the idea of a great God supreme over all. So, too, this new idolater preaches in the same
fashion, and in particular that baptism is “into an artificer and creator,” not fearing the
curse of those who cause addition or diminution to the Holy Scriptures. And he closes his
book with showing him to be Antichrist.</head>
<p>Afterwards, however, he gives his discourse a more moderate turn, imparting to it even
a touch of gentleness, and, though he had but a little earlier partitioned off the Son from
the title of Existent, he now says,—“We affirm that the Son is not only existent, and above
all existent things, but we also call Him Lord and God, the Maker of every being1006, sensible
and intelligible.” What does he suppose this “being” to be? created? or uncreated? For if he
confesses Jesus to be Lord, God, and Maker of all intelligible being, it necessarily follows, if
he says it is uncreated, that he speaks falsely, ascribing to the Son the making of the uncreated
Nature. But if he believes it to be created, he makes Him His own Maker. For if the act of
creation be not separated from intelligible nature in favour of Him Who is independent and
uncreated, there will no longer remain any mark of distinction, as the sensible creation and
the intelligible being will be thought of under one head1007. But here he brings in the assertion
<note type="footnote">1005 The grammar of this section of the analysis is in parts very much confused; the general drift of its intention,
rather than its literal meaning, is given in the translation. Grammatically speaking it appears to attribute to S.

that “in the creation of existent things He has been entrusted by the Father with the construction
of all things visible and invisible, and with the providential care over all that comes into
being, inasmuch as the power allotted to Him from above is sufficient for the production
of those things which have been constructed1008.” The vast length to which our treatise has
run compels us to pass over these assertions briefly: but, in a sense, profanity surrounds the
argument, containing a vast swarm of notions like venomous wasps. “He was entrusted,”
he says, “with the construction of things by the Father.” But if he had been talking about
some artizan executing his work at the pleasure of his employer, would he not have used
the same language? For we are not wrong in saying just the same of Bezaleel, that being entrusted
by Moses with the building of the tabernacle, he became the constructor of those
things there1009 mentioned, and would not have taken the work in hand had he not previously
acquired his knowledge by Divine inspiration, and ventured upon the undertaking on Moses’
entrusting him with its execution. Accordingly the term “entrusted” suggests that His office
and power in creation came to Him as something adventitious, in the sense that before He
was entrusted with that commission He had neither the will nor the power to act, but when
He received authority to execute the works, and power sufficient for the works, then He
became the artificer of things that are, the power allotted to Him from on high being, as
Eunomius says, sufficient for the purpose. Does he then place even the generation of the
Son, by some astrological juggling1010, under some destiny, just as they who practise this
vain deceit affirm that the appointment of their lot in life comes to men at the time of their
birth, by such and such conjunctions or oppositions of the stars, as the rotation above moves
on in a kind of ordered train, assigning to those who are coming into being their special
faculties? It may be that something of this kind is in the mind of our sage, and he says that
to Him that is above all rule, and authority, and dominion, and above every name that is
named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, there has been allotted, as
though He were pent in some hollow spaces, power from on high, measured out in accordance

treatise also summarily, letting fall from a slight commencement of investigation, for the
more intelligent sort of readers, seeds to enable them to discern his profanity. Moreover, in

what follows, there is ready written a kind of apology for ourselves. For we cannot any longer
be thought to be missing the intention of his discourse, and misinterpreting his words to
render them subject to criticism, when his own voice acknowledges the absurdity of his
doctrine. His words stand as follows:—“What? did not earth and angel come into being,
when before they were not?” See how our lofty theologian is not ashamed to apply the same
description to earth and angels and to the Maker of all! Surely if he thinks it fit to predicate
the same of earth and its Lord, he must either make a god of the one, or degrade the other
to a level with it.</p>
<p>Then he adds to this something by which his profanity is yet more completely stripped
of all disguise, so that its absurdity is obvious even to a child. For he says,—“It would be a
long task to detail all the modes of generation of intelligible objects, or the essences which
do not all possess the nature of the Existent in common, but display variations according
to the operations of Him Who constructed them.” Without any words of ours, the blasphemy
against the Son which is here contained is glaring and conspicuous, when he acknowledges
that that which is predicated of every mode of generation and essence in nowise differs from
the description of the Divine subsistence1011 of the Only-begotten. But it seems to me best
to pass over the intermediate passages in which he seeks to maintain his profanity, and to
hasten to the head and front of the accusation which we have to bring against his doctrines.
For he will be found to exhibit the sacrament of regeneration as an idle thing, the mystic
oblation as profitless, and the participation in them as of no advantage to those who are
partakers therein. For after those high-wrought æons1012 in which, by way of disparagement
of our doctrine, he names as its supporters a Valentinus, a Cerinthus, a Basilides, a Montanus,
and a Marcion, and after laying it down that those who affirm that the Divine nature is unknowable,
and the mode of His generation unknowable, have no right or title whatever to
the name of Christians, and after reckoning us among those whom he thus disparages, he
proceeds to develop his own view in these terms:—“But we, in agreement with holy and
blessed men; affirm that the mystery of godliness does not consist in venerable names, nor
in the distinctive character of customs and sacramental tokens, but in exactness of doctrine.”
That when he wrote this, he did so not under the guidance of evangelists, apostles, or any
of the authors of the Old Testament, is plain to every one who has any acquaintance with
the sacred and Divine Scripture. We should naturally be led to suppose that by “holy and
blessed men” he meant Manichæus, Nicolaus, Colluthus, Aetius, Arius, and the rest of the
same band, with whom he is in strict accord in laying down this principle, that neither the
confession of sacred names, nor the customs of the Church, nor her sacramental tokens,
are a ratification of godliness. But we, having learnt from the holy voice of Christ that “except

a man be born again of water and of the Spirit he shall not enter into the kingdom of God1013”
and that “He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, shall live for ever1014,” are persuaded
that the mystery of godliness is ratified by the confession of the Divine Names—the
Names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that our salvation is confirmed by
participation in the sacramental customs and tokens. But doctrines have often been carefully
investigated by those who have had no part or lot in that mystery, and one may hear many
such putting forward the faith we hold as a subject for themselves in the rivalry of debate,
and some of them often even succeeding in hitting the truth, and for all that none the less
estranged from the faith. Since, then, he despises the revered Names, by which the power
of the more Divine birth distributes grace to them who come for it in faith, and slights the
fellowship of the sacramental customs and tokens from which the Christian profession
draws its vigour, let us, with a slight variation, utter to those who listen to his deceit the
word of the prophet:—“How long will ye be slow of heart? Why do ye love destruction and
seek after leasing1015?” How is it that ye do not see the persecutor of the faith inviting those
who consent unto him to violate their Christian profession? For if the confession of the
revered and precious Names of the Holy Trinity is useless, and the customs of the Church
unprofitable, and if among these customs is the sign of the cross1016, prayer, baptism, confession
of sins, a ready zeal to keep the commandment, right ordering of character, sobriety
of life, regard to justice, the effort not to be excited by passion, or enslaved by pleasure, or
to fall short in moral excellence,—if he says that none of such habits as these is cultivated
to any good purpose, and that the sacramental tokens do not, as we have believed, secure
spiritual blessings, and avert from believers the assaults directed against them by the wiles
of the evil one, what else does he do but openly proclaim aloud to men that he deems the
mystery which Christians cherish a fable, laughs at the majesty of the Divine Names, considers
the customs of the Church a jest, and all sacramental operations idle prattle and folly? What
beyond this do they who remain attached to paganism bring forward in disparagement of
our creed? Do not they too make the majesty of the sacred Names, in which the faith is ratified,
an occasion of laughter? Do not they deride the sacramental tokens and the customs
which are observed by the initiated? And of whom is it so much a distinguishing peculiarity
as of the pagans, to think that piety should consist in doctrines only? since they also say that
according to their view, there is something more persuasive than the Gospel which we

preach, and some of them hold that there is some one great God preeminent above the rest,
and acknowledge some subject powers, differing among themselves in the way of superiority
or inferiority, in some regular order and sequence, but all alike subject to the Supreme. This,
then, is what the teachers of the new idolatry preach, and they who follow them have no
dread of the condemnation that abideth on transgressors, as though they did not understand
that actually to do some improper thing is far more grievous than to err in word alone. They,
then, who in act deny the faith, and slight the confession of the sacred Names, and judge
the sanctification effected by the sacramental tokens to be worthless, and have been persuaded
to have regard to cunningly devised fables, and to fancy that their salvation consists in
quibbles about the generate and the ungenerate,—what else are they than transgressors of
the doctrines of salvation?</p>
<p>But if any one thinks that these charges are brought against them by us ungenerously
and unfairly, let him consider independently our author’s writings, both what we have previously
alleged, and what is inferred in logical connection with our citations. For in direct
contravention of the law of the Lord—(for the deliverance to us of the means of initiation
constitutes a law),—he says that baptism is not into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
as Christ commanded His disciples when He delivered to them the mystery, but into an
artificer and creator, and “not only Father,” he says, “of the Only-begotten, but also His
God1017.” Woe unto him who gives his neighbour to drink turbid mischief1018! How does
he trouble and befoul the truth by flinging his mud into it! How is it that he feels no fear of
the curse that rests upon those who add aught to the Divine utterance, or dare to take aught
away? Let us read the declaration of the Lord in His very words—“Go,” He says, “teach all
nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
Where did He call the Son a creature? Where did the Word teach that the Father is creator
and artificer of the Only-begotten? Where in the words cited is it taught that the Son is a
servant of God? Where in the delivery of the mystery is the God of the Son proclaimed? Do
ye not perceive and understand, ye who are dragged by guile to perdition, what sort of guide
ye have put in charge of your souls,—one who interpolates the Holy Scriptures, who garbles
the Divine utterances, who with his own mud befouls the purity of the doctrines of godliness,
who not only arms his own tongue against us, but also attempts to tamper with the sacred
voices of truth, who is eager to invest his own perversion with more authority than the
teaching of the Lord? Do ye not perceive that he stirs himself up against the Name at which

are more authoritative than those of Christ, and of transforming the faith from the Divine
Names and the sacramental customs and tokens to his own deceit,—what else, I say, could

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">       
<head>§1. This twelfth book gives a notable interpretation of the words of the Lord to Mary, “Touch
Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father.”</head>
<p>But let us see what is the next addition that follows upon this profanity, an addition
which is in fact the key of their defence of their doctrine. For those who would degrade the
majesty of the glory of the Only-begotten to slavish and grovelling conceptions think that
they find the strongest proof of their assertions in the words of the Lord to Mary, which He
uttered after His resurrection, and before His ascension into heaven, saying, “Touch Me
not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren and say unto them, I
ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God1019.” The orthodox
interpretation of these words, the sense in which we have been accustomed to believe that
they were spoken to Mary, is I think manifest to all who have received the faith in truth.
Still the discussion of this point shall be given by us in its proper place; but meantime it is
worth while to inquire from those who allege against us such phrases as “ascending,” “being
seen,” “being recognized by touch,” and moreover “being associated with men by brotherhood,”
whether they consider them to be proper to the Divine or to the Human Nature. For
if they see in the Godhead the capacity of being seen and touched, of being supported by
meat and drink, kinship and brotherhood with men, and all the attributes of corporeal
nature, then let them predicate of the Only-begotten God both these and whatsoever else
they will, as motive energy and local change, which are peculiar to things circumscribed by
a body. But if He by Mary is discoursing with His brethren, and if the Only-begotten has
no brethren, (for how, if He had brethren, could the property of being Only-begotten be
preserved?) and if the same Person Who said, “God is a Spirit1020,” says to His disciples,
“Handle Me1021,” that He may show that while the Human Nature is capable of being
handled the Divinity is intangible, and if He Who says, “I go,” indicates local change, while
He who contains all things, “in Whom,” as the Apostle says, “all things were created, and
in Whom all things consist1022,” has nothing in existent things external to Himself to which
removal could take place by any kind of motion, (for motion cannot otherwise be effected
than by that which is removed leaving the place in which it is, and occupying another place
instead, while that which extends through all, and is in all, and controls all, and is confined
by no existent thing, has no place to which to pass, inasmuch as nothing is void of the Divine
fulness,) how can these men abandon the belief that such expressions arise from that which

is apparent, and apply them to that Nature which is Divine and which surpasseth all understanding,
when the Apostle has in his speech to the Athenians plainly forbidden us to imagine
any such thing of God, inasmuch as the Divine power is not discoverable by touch1023, but
by intelligent contemplation and faith? Or, again, whom does He Who did eat before the
eyes of His disciples, and promised to go before them into Galilee and there be seen of
them,—whom does He reveal Him to be Who should so appear to them? God, Whom no
man hath seen or can see1024? or the bodily image, that is, the form of a servant in which
God was? If then what has been said plainly proves that the meaning of the phrases alleged
refers to that which is visible, expressing shape, and capable of motion, akin to the nature
of His disciples, and none of these properties is discernible in Him Who is invisible, incorporeal,
intangible, and formless, how do they come to degrade the very Only-begotten God,
Who was in the beginning, and is in the Father, to a level with Peter, Andrew, John, and the
rest of the Apostles, by calling them the brethren and fellow-servants of the Only-begotten?
And yet all their exertions are directed to this aim, to show that in majesty of nature there
is as great a distance between the Father and the dignity, power, and essence of the Onlybegotten,
as there is between the Only-begotten and humanity. And they press this saying
into the support of this meaning, treating the name of the God and Father as being of
common significance in respect of the Lord and of His disciples, in the view that no difference
in dignity of nature is conceived while He is recognized as God and Father both of Him and
of them in a precisely similar manner.
And the mode in which they logically maintain their profanity is as follows;—that either
by the relative term employed there is expressed community of essence also between the
disciples and the Father, or else we must not by this phrase bring even the Lord into communion
in the Father’s Nature, and that, even as the fact1025 that the God over all is named
as their God implies that the disciples are His servants so by parity of reasoning, it is acknowledged,
by the words in question, that the Son also is the servant of God. Now that the words
addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn
from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level
with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He
then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the
sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words,
following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from
Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of

the Apostle. “For there is one God,” he says, “and Father, of Whom are all things1026.” Accordingly
human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow
spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution
none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the
authority of oversight or of foresight1027, imports a certain relation to humanity. For He
Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what
He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience,
our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father’s image, but
was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of
similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and
Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own
depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the
Apostle says, “by nature were no Gods1028,” and in the place of the Father, he was deemed
father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, “The partridge
called, she gathered together what she hatched not1029.” Since, then, this was the sum of
our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the
Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational
creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved
by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature1030. For human
nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away
from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant
and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged
from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the
Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us1031, and frees us from the curse by taking
on Him our curse as His own1032, and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle,
“slain” in Himself “the enmity1033” which by means of sin had come between us and
God,—(in fact sin was “the enmity”)—and having become what we were, He through

Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship
with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God1034, in Whom dwelt
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily1035, He drew with Him into the same grace all the
nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims
through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day
become disciples of the Word,—the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor
cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned
to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is
hallowed1036. “For behold,” He says, “I and the children whom God hath given Me1037.”
He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you
back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin1038. And
so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and
our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this
benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings
of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ’s Humanity is a
common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of
the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens,
we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also “shall be caught up in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air1039,” even so, when we hear that the true God and Father
has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God
has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt that we shall come to the
same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner1040. And the fact too that
this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we
have given. For since, as the Apostle tells us, “the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression1041,”
and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause
she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection
the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning
a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought

into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering1042
to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men
the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It
is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text
may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout
reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with
that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory
of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the
dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable,
and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity,
that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.</p>

<head>§2. Then referring to the blasphemy of Eunomius, which had been refuted by the great Basil,
where he banished the Only-begotten God to the realm of darkness, and the apology or
explanation which Eunomius puts forth for his blasphemy, he shows that his present
blasphemy is rendered by his apology worse than his previous one; and herein he very ably
discourses of the “true” and the “unapproachable” Light.</head>
<p>Let us also investigate this point as well,—what defence he has to offer on those matters
on which he was convicted of error by the great Basil, when he banishes the Only-begotten
God to the realm of darkness, saying, “As great as is the difference between the generate
and the ungenerate, so great is the divergence between Light and Light.” For as he has already
shown that the difference between the generate and the ungenerate is not merely one of
greater or less intensity, but that they are diametrically opposed as regards their meaning;
and since he has inferred by logical consequence from his premises that, as the difference
between the light of the Father and that of the Son corresponds to ungeneracy and generation,
we must necessarily suppose in the Son not a diminution of light, but a complete alienation
from light. For as we cannot say that generation is a modified ungeneracy, but the signification
of the terms γέννησις and ἀγεννησία are absolutely contradictory and mutually exclusive,
so, if the same distinction is to be preserved between the Light of the Father and
that conceived as existing in the Son, it will be logically concluded that the Son is not
henceforth to be conceived as Light, as he is excluded alike from ungeneracy itself, and from
the light which accompanies that condition,—and He Who is something different from
light will evidently, by consequence, have affinity with its contrary,—since this absurdity, I
say, results from his principles, Eunomius endeavours to explain it away by dialectic artifices,
delivering himself as follows: “For we know, we know the true Light, we know Him who
created the light after the heavens and the earth, we have heard the Life and Truth Himself,
even Christ, saying to His disciples, ‘Ye are the light of the world1043,’ we have learned from
the blessed Paul, when he gives the title of ‘Light unapproachable1044’ to the God over all,
and by the addition defines and teaches us the transcendent superiority of His Light; and
now that we have learnt that there is so great a difference between the one Light and the
other, we shall not patiently endure so much as the mere mention of the notion that the
conception of light in either case is one and the same.” Can he be serious when he advances
such arguments in his attempts against the truth, or is he experimenting upon the dulness
of those who follow his error to see whether they can detect so childish and transparent a
fallacy, or have no sense to discern such a barefaced imposition? For I suppose that no one
is so senseless as not to perceive the juggling with equivocal terms by which Eunomius deludes
both himself and his admirers. The disciples, he says, were termed light, and that
<note type="footnote">1043 S. Matt. v. 14</note>
<note type="footnote">1044 Cf. 1 Tim. vi. 16. The quotation, as S. Gregory points out, is inexact.</note>

<pb n="465"/>
which was produced in the course of creation is also called light. But who does not know
that in these only the name is common, and the thing meant in each case is quite different?
For the light of the sun gives discernment to the sight, but the word of the disciples implants
in men’s souls the illumination of the truth. If, then, he is aware of this difference even in
the case of that light, so that he thinks the light of the body is one thing, and the light of the
soul another, we need no longer discuss the point with him, since his defence itself condemns
him if we hold our peace. But if in that light he cannot discover such a difference as regards
the mode of operation, (for it is not, he may say, the light of the eyes that illumines the flesh,
and the spiritual light which illumines the soul, but the operation and the potency of the
one light and of the other is the same, operating in the same sphere and on the same objects,)
then how is it that from the difference between the light of the beams of the sun and that of
the words of the Apostles, he infers a like difference between the Only-begotten Light and
the Light of the Father? “But the Son,” he says, “is called the ‘true’ Light, the Father ‘Light
unapproachable.’” Well, these additional distinctions import a difference in degree only,
and not in kind, between the light of the Son and the light of the Father. He thinks that the
“true” is one thing, and the “unapproachable” another. I suppose there is no one so idiotic
as not to see the real identity of meaning in the two terms. For the “true” and the “unapproachable”
are each of them removed in an equally absolute degree from their contraries.
For as the “true” does not admit any intermixture of the false, even so the “unapproachable”
does not admit the access of its contrary. For the “unapproachable” is surely unapproachable
by evil. But the light of the Son is not evil; for how can any one see in evil that which is true?
Since, then, the truth is not evil, no one can say that the light which is in the Father is unapproachable
by the truth. For if it were to reject the truth it would of course be associated
with falsehood. For the nature of contradictories is such that the absence of the better involves
the presence of its opposite. If, then, any one were to say that the Light of the Father was
contemplated as remote from the presentation of its opposite, he would interpret the term
“unapproachable” in a manner agreeable to the intention of the Apostle. But if he were to
say that “unapproachable” signified alienation from good, he would suppose nothing else
than that God was alien from, and at enmity with, Himself, being at the same time good
and opposed to good. But this is impossible: for the good is akin to good. Accordingly the
one Light is not divergent from the other. For the Son is the true Light, and the Father is
Light unapproachable. In fact I would make bold to say that the man who should interchange
the two attributes would not be wrong. For the true is unapproachable by the false, and on
the other side, the unapproachable is found to be in unsullied truth. Accordingly the unapproachable
is identical with the true, because that which is signified by each expression is
equally inaccessible to evil. What is the difference then, that is imagined to exist in these by
him who imposes on himself and his followers by the equivocal use of the term “Light”?
But let us not pass over this point either without notice, that it is only after garbling the

<pb n="466"/>
Apostle’s words to suit his own fancy that he cites the phrase as if it came from him. For
Paul says, “dwelling in light unapproachable1045.” But there is a great difference between
being oneself something and being in something. For he who said, “dwelling in light unapproachable,”
did not, by the word “dwelling,” indicate God Himself, but that which surrounds
Him, which in our view is equivalent to the Gospel phrase which tells us that the Father is
in the Son. For the Son is true Light, and the truth is unapproachable by falsehood; so then
the Son is Light unapproachable in which the Father dwells, or in Whom the Father is.</p>

<head>§3. He further proceeds notably to interpret the language of the Gospel, “In the beginning was
the Word,” and “Life” and “Light,” and “The Word was made flesh,” which had been
misinterpreted by Eunomius; and overthrows his blasphemy, and shows that the dispensation
of the Lord took place by loving-kindness, not by lack of power, and with the cooperation
of the Father.</head>
<p>But he puts his strength into his idle contention and says, “From the facts themselves,
and from the oracles that are believed, I present the proof of my statement.” Such is his
promise, but whether the arguments he advances bear out his professions, the discerning
reader will of course consider. “The blessed John,” he says, “after saying that the Word was
in the beginning, and after calling Him Life, and subsequently giving the Life the further
title of ‘Light,’ says, a little later, ‘And the Word was made flesh1046.’ If then the Light is Life,
and the Word is Life, and the Word was made flesh, it thence becomes plain that the Light
was incarnate.” What then? because the Light and the Life, and God and the Word, was
manifested in flesh, does it follow that the true Light is divergent in any degree from the
Light which is in the Father? Nay, it is attested by the Gospel that, even when it had place
in darkness, the light remained unapproachable by the contrary element: for “the Light,”
he says, “shined in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not1047.” If then the light
when it found place in darkness had been changed to its contrary, and overpowered by
gloom, this would have been a strong argument in support of the view of those who wish
to show how far inferior is this Light in comparison with that contemplated in the Father.
But if the Word, even though it be in the flesh, remains the Word, and if the Light, even
though it shines in darkness, is no less Light, without admitting the fellowship of its contrary,
and if the Life, even though it be in death, remains secure in Itself, and if God, even though
He submit to take upon Him the form of a servant, does not Himself become a servant, but
takes away the slavish subordination and absorbs it into lordship and royalty, making that
which was human and lowly to become both Lord and Christ,—if all this be so, how does
he show by this argument variation of the Light to inferiority, when each Light has in equal
measure the property of being inconvertible to evil, and unalterable? And how is it that he
also fails to observe this, that he who looked on the incarnate Word, Who was both Light
and Life and God, recognized, through the glory which he saw, the Father of glory, and says,
“We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father1048”?</p>

<pb n="468"/>
<p>But he has reached the irrefutable argument which we long ago detected lurking in the
sequel of his statements1049, but which is here proclaimed aloud without disguise. For he
wishes to show that the essence of the Son is subject to passion, and to decay, and in no wise
differs from material nature, which is in a state of flux, that by this means he may demonstrate
His difference from the Father. For he says, “If he can show that the God Who is over all,
Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate or could be incarnate, came under authority,
obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, let him say that the Light
is equal to the Light.” If these words had been brought forward by us as following by necessary
consequence from premises laid down by Eunomius, who would not have charged us with
unfairness, in employing an over-subtle dialectic to reduce our adversaries’ statement to
such an absurdity? But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to
suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our
contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured
the argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against
the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of
disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose,
but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering
of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise
upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so
that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink
downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and
that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature
of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of
evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was
incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the
Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he
either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness. For if to partake of our
flesh is evil, then he predicates evil of the Only-begotten God; but if the lovingkindness to
man was good, then he makes out the Father to be powerless for good, by saying that it
would not have been in His power to have effectually bestowed such grace by taking flesh.
And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation
both in the Father and in the Son? “For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth
them,” He says, “even so the Son quickeneth whom He will1050,”—meaning obviously by
“dead” us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth,
and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the

<note type="footnote">1050 S. John v. 21</note>

<pb n="469"/>
adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing
to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But
“Light,” he says, “is not equal to Light,” because the one he calls “true,” and the other “unapproachable.”
Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why
so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be
greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel “true
God1051,” the other “God1052” without the addition of “true.” How then does the same term,
as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to
Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is
true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the
Father, because the former is called “true Light1053,” and the latter not so. “But this Light,”
says Eunomius, “carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative
with respect to that gracious action.” A new and strange mode of determining priority in
dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that
which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst
Christians,—a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has
not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing
is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation
carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy
will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not
this that He indicates Who said, “He that sent Me is with Me1054,” and “The Father that
dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works1055.” With what right then does heresy attribute to the
Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from
having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of
thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside
the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten
Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be
directed against the majesty of the Father? And this seems to me to be a necessary result of
their method of proceeding. For if he that honoureth the Son honoureth the Father1056,
according to the Divine declaration, it is plain on the other side that an assault upon the
Son strikes at the Father. But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the

preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal
thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the
Father’s will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is “that all men should be saved1057”),
they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation
would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation
for us through His own power. And we have learnt from the Scripture that the Son is
the power of the Father1058.</p>

<head>§4. He then again charges Eunomius with having learnt his term ἀγεννησίαfrom the hieroglyphic
writings, and from the Egyptian mythology and idolatry, and with bringing in
Anubis, Osiris, and Isis to the creed of Christians, and shows that, considered as admitting
His sufferings of necessity and not voluntarily, the Only-begotten is entitled to no gratitude
from men: and that fire has none for its warmth, nor water for its fluidity, as they do not
refer their results to self-determining power, but to necessity of nature1059.</head>
<p>Let us once more notice the passage cited. “If he can show,” he says, “that the God Who
is over all, Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate, or could be incarnate,….then
let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.” The purport of his words is plain from the
very form of the sentence, namely, that he does not think that it was by His almighty Godhead
that the Son proved strong for such a form of loving-kindness, but that it was by being of a
nature subject to passion that He stooped to the suffering of the Cross. Well, as I pondered
and inquired how Eunomius came to stumble into such notions about the Deity, as to think
that on the one side the ungenerate Light was unapproachable by its contrary, and entirely
unimpaired and free from every passion and affection, but that on the other the generate
was intermediate in its nature, so as not to preserve the Divine unsullied and pure in impassibility,
but to have an essence mixed and compounded of contraries, which at once
stretched out to partake of good, and at the same time melted away into a condition subject
to passion, since it was impossible to obtain from Scripture premises to support so absurd
a theory, the thought struck me, whether it could be that he was an admirer of the speculations
of the Egyptians on the subject of the Divine, and had mixed up their fancies with his
views concerning the Only-begotten. For it is reported that they say that their fantastic mode
of compounding their idols, when they adapt the forms of certain irrational animals to human
limbs, is an enigmatic symbol of that mixed nature which they call “dæmon,” and that this
is more subtle than that of men, and far surpasses our nature in power, but has the Divine
element in it not unmingled or uncompounded, but is combined with the nature of the soul
and the perceptions of the body, and is receptive of pleasure and pain, neither of which finds
place with the “ungenerate God.” For they too use this name, ascribing to the supreme God,
as they imagine Him, the attribute of ungeneracy. Thus our sage theologian seems to us to
be importing into the Christian creed an Anubis, Isis, or Osiris from the Egyptian shrines,
all but the acknowledgment of their names: but there is no difference in profanity between
him who openly makes profession of the names of idols, and him who, while holding the
belief about them in his heart, is yet chary of their names. If, then, it is impossible to get out
of Holy Scripture any support for this impiety, while their theory draws all its strength from
the riddles of the hieroglyphics, assuredly there can be no doubt what right-minded persons
ought to think of this. But that this accusation which we bring is no insulting slander, Eun-

<pb n="472"/>
omius shall testify for us by his own words, saying as he does that the ungenerate Light is
unapproachable, and has not the power of stooping to experience affections, but affirming
that such a condition is germane and akin to the generate: so that man need feel no gratitude
to the Only-begotten God for what He suffered, if, as they say, it was by the spontaneous
action of His nature that He slipped down to the experience of affections, His essence, which
was capable of being thus affected, being naturally dragged down thereto, which demands
no thanks. For who would welcome as a boon that which takes place by necessity, even if it
be gainful and profitable? For we neither thank fire for its warmth nor water for its fluidity,
as we refer these qualities to the necessity of their several natures, because fire cannot be
deserted by its power of warming, nor can water remain stationary upon an incline, inasmuch
as the slope spontaneously draws its motion onwards. If, then, they say that the benefit
wrought by the Son through His incarnation was by a necessity of His nature, they certainly
render Him no thanks, inasmuch as they refer what He did, not to an authoritative power,
but to a natural compulsion. But if, while they experience the benefit of the gift, they disparage
the lovingkindness that brought it, I fear lest their impiety should work round to the opposite
error, and lest they should deem the condition of the Son, that could be thus affected, worthy
of more honour than the freedom from such affections possessed by the Father, making
their own advantage the criterion of good. For if the case had been that the Son was incapable
of being thus affected, as they affirm of the Father, our nature would still have remained in
its miserable plight, inasmuch as there would have been none to lift up man’s nature to incorruption
by what He Himself experienced;—and so it escapes notice that the cunning of
these quibblers, by the very means which it employs in its attempt to destroy the majesty of
the Only-begotten God, does but raise men’s conceptions of Him to a grander and loftier
height, seeing it is the case that He Who has the power to act, is more to be honoured than
one who is powerless for good.</p>

<head>§5. Then, again discussing the true Light and unapproachable Light of the Father and of the
Son, special attributes, community and essence, and showing the relation of “generate”
and “ungenerate,” as involving no opposition in sense1060, but presenting an opposition
and contradiction admitting of no middle term, he ends the book.</head>
<p>But I feel that my argument is running away with me, for it does not remain in the
regular course, but, like some hot-blooded and spirited colt, is carried away by the blasphemies
of our opponents to range over the absurdities of their system. Accordingly we
must restrain it when it would run wild beyond the bounds of moderation in demonstration
of absurd consequences. But the kindly reader will doubtless pardon what we have said, not
imputing the absurdity that emerges from our investigation to us, but to those who laid
down such mischievous premises. We must, however, now transfer our attention to another
of his statements. For he says that our God also is composite, in that while we suppose the
Light to be common, we yet separate the one Light from the other by certain special attributes
and various differences. For that is none the less composite which, while united by one
common nature, is yet separated by certain differences and conjunctions of peculiarities1061.
To this our answer is short and easily dismissed. For what he brings as matter of accusation
against our doctrines we acknowledge against ourselves, if he is not found to establish the
same position by his own words. Let us just consider what he has written. He calls the Lord
“true” Light, and the Father Light “unapproachable.” Accordingly, by thus naming each, he
also acknowledges their community in respect to light. But as titles are applied to things
because they fit them, as he has often insisted, we do not conceive that the name of “light”
is used of the Divine Nature barely, apart from some meaning, but rather that it is predicated
by virtue of some underlying reality. Accordingly, by the use of a common name, they recognize
the identity of the objects signified, since they have already declared that the natures
of those things which have the same name cannot be different. Since, then, the meaning of
“Light” is one and the same, the addition of “unapproachable” and “true,” according to the
language of heresy, separates the common nature by specific differences, so that the Light
of the Father is conceived as one thing, and the Light of the Son as another, separated one
from the other by special properties. Let him, then, either overthrow his own positions to
avoid making out by his statements that the Deity is composite, or let him abstain from
charging against us what he may see contained in his own language. For our statement does
not hereby violate the simplicity of the Godhead, since community and specific difference
<note type="footnote">1060 The composer of the analysis seems to have been slightly confused by the discussion on the nature of
contradictory opposition.</note>
<note type="footnote">1061 It is not clear how far the preceding sentences are an exact reproduction of Eunomius: they are probably
a summary of his argument.</note>

<pb n="474"/>
are not essence, so that the conjunction of these should render the subject composite1062.
But on the one side the essence by itself remains whatever it is in nature, being what it is,
while, on the other, every one possessed of reason would say that these—community and
specific difference—were among the accompanying conceptions and attributes: since even
in us men there may be discerned some community with the Divine Nature, but Divinity
is not the more on that account humanity, or humanity Divinity. For while we believe that
God is good, we also find this character predicated of men in Scripture. But the special signification
in each case establishes a distinction in the community arising from the use of
the homonymous term. For He Who is the fountain of goodness is named from it; but he
who has some share of goodness also partakes in the name, and God is not for this reason
composite, that He shares with men the title of “good.” From these considerations it must
obviously be allowed that the idea of community is one thing, and that of essence another,
and we are not on that account any the more to maintain composition or multiplicity of
parts in that simple Nature which has nothing to do with quantity, because some of the attributes
we contemplate in It are either regarded as special, or have a sort of common significance.</p>
<p>But let us pass on, if it seems good, to another of his statements, and dismiss the nonsense
that comes between. He who laboriously reiterates against our argument the Aristotelian
division of existent things, has elaborated “genera,” and “species,” and “differentiæ,” and
“individuals,” and advanced all the technical language of the categories for the injury of our
doctrines. Let us pass by all this, and turn our discourse to deal with his heavy and irresistible
argument. For having braced his argument with Demosthenic fervour, he has started up to
our view as a second Pæanian of Oltiseris1063, imitating that orator’s severity in his struggle
with us. I will transcribe the language of our author word for word. “Yes,” he says, “but if,
as the generate is contrary to the ungenerate, the Generate Light be equally inferior to the
Ungenerate Light, the one will be found to be1064 light, the other darkness.” Let him who
has the leisure learn from his words how pungent is his mode of dealing with this opposition,
and how exactly it hits the mark. But I would beg this imitator of our words either to say
what we have said, or to make his imitation of it as close as may be, or else, if he deals with
our argument according to his own education and ability, to speak in his own person and
not in ours. For I hope that no one will so miss our meaning as to suppose that, while
“generate” is contradictory in sense to “ungenerate,” one is a diminution of the other. For
the difference between contradictories is not one of greater or less intensity, but rests its
<note type="footnote">1062 Oehler’s punctuation seems rather to obscure the sense.</note>
<note type="footnote">1063 That is, a new Demosthenes, with a difference. Demosthenes’ native place was the Attic deme of Pæania.

opposition upon their being mutually exclusive in their signification: as, for example, we
say that a man is asleep or not asleep, sitting or not sitting, that he was or was not, and all
the rest after the same model, where the denial of one is the assertion of its contradictory.
As, then, to live is not a diminution of not living, but its complete opposite, even so we
conceived having been generated not as a diminution of not having been generated, but as
an opposite and contradictory not admitting of any middle term, so that which is expressed
by the one has nothing whatever to do with that which is expressed by the other in the way
of less or more. Let him therefore who says that one of two contradictories is defective as
compared with the other, speak in his own person, not in ours. For our homely language
says that things which correspond to contradictories differ from one another even as their
originals do. So that, even if Eunomius discerns in the Light the same divergence as in the
generate compared with the Ungenerate, I will re-assert my statement, that as in the one
case the one member of the contradiction has nothing in common with its opposite, so if
“light” be placed on the same side as one of the two contradictories, the remaining place in
the figure must of course be assigned to “darkness,” the necessity of the antithesis arranging
the term of light over against its opposite, in accordance with the analogy of the previous
contradictory terms “generate” and “ungenerate.” Such is the clumsy answer which we, who
as our disparaging author says, have attempted to write without logical training, deliver in
our rustic dialect to our new Pæanian. But to see how he contended with this contradiction,
advancing against us those hot and fire-breathing words of his with Demosthenic intensity,
let those who like to have a laugh study the treatise of our orator itself. For our pen is not
very hard to rouse to confute the notions of impiety, but is quite unsuited to the task of ridiculing
the ignorance of untutored minds.</p>

<head>Introduction to ᾽Επινοια</head>
<p>It is important, for the understanding of the following Book, to determine what faculty
of the mind ᾽Επίνοια is. Eunomius, Gregory says, “makes a solemn travesty” of the word.
He reduces its force to its lowest level, and makes it only “fancy the unnatural,” either contracting
or extending the limits of nature, or putting heterogeneous notions together. He
instances colossi, pigmies, centaurs, as the result of this mental operation. “Fancy,” or “notion,”
would thus represent Eunomius’ view of it. But Gregory ascribes every art and every
science to the play of this faculty. “According to my account, it is the method by which we
discover things that are unknown, going on to further discoveries, by means of what adjoins
and follows from our first perception with regard to the thing studied.” He instances Ontology
(!), Arithmetic, Geometry, on the one hand, Agriculture, Navigation, Horology, on the
other, as the result of it. “Any one who should judge this faculty more precious than any
other with the exercise of which we are gifted would not be far mistaken.” “Induction” might
almost represent this view of it. But then Gregory does not deny that “lying wonders are
also fabricated by it.” By means of it “and entertainer might amuse an audience” with firebreathing
monsters, men enfolded in the coils of serpents, U+0026c. He calls it an inventive faculty.
It must therefore be something more spontaneous than ratiocination, whether deductive
or inductive; while it is more reliable than Fancy or Imagination.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by what S. John Damascene, in his Dialectica (c. 65), says of ᾽Επίνοια:
“It is of two sorts. The first is the faculty which analyses and elucidates the view of things
undissected and in the gross (ὁλοσχερῆ): whereby a simple phenomenon becomes complex
speculatively: for instance, man becomes a compound of soul and body. The second, by a
union of perception and fancy, produces fictions out of realities, i.e. divides wholes into
parts, and combines those parts, selected arbitrarily, into new wholes; e.g. Centaurs, Sirens.”
Analysis (scientific) would describe the one; fancy, the other. Basil and Gregory were
thinking of the one, Eunomius of the other; but still both parties used the same expression.</p>
<p>If, then, there is one word that will cover the whole meaning, it would seem to be
“Conception.” This word at all events, both in its outward form and in its intention, stands
to perception in a way strictly analogous to that in which ᾽Επίνοια stands to ῎Εννοια. Both
Conception and ᾽Επίνοια represent some regulated operation of the mind upon data immediately
given. In both cases the mind is led to contemplate in a new light its own contents,
whether sensations or innate ideas. The fitness of Conception as an equivalent of ᾽Επίνοια
will be clear when we consider the real point at issue between Basil and Eunomius. Their
controversy rages round the term Ungenerate. Is it, or is it not, expressive of the substance
(being) of the Deity? To answer this question, it was found necessary to ascertain how such
a name for the Supreme has been acquired. “By a conception,” says Basil. “No,” says Euno-

<pb n="477"/>
mius: “it would be dangerous to trust the naming of the Deity to a common operation of
the mind. The faculty of Conception may and does play us false; it can create monstrosities.
Besides, if the names of the Father are conceptions, the names of the Son are too; for instance,
the Door, the Shepherd, the Axe, the Vine. But as our Lord Himself applied these to Himself,
He would, according to you, be employing the faculty of conception; and it is blasphemous
to think that He employed names which we too might have arrived at by conceiving of Him
in these particular ways. Therefore, Conception is not the Source of the Divine Names; but
rather they come from a perception or intention implanted in us directly from on High.
Ungenerate is such a name; and it reveals to us the very substance of the Deity.” But Gregory
defends Basil’s position. He shows the entire relativity of our knowledge of the Deity. Ungenerate
and every other name of God is due to a conception; in each case we perceive either
an operation of the Deity, or an element of evil, and then we conceive of Him as operating
in the one, or as free from the other; and so name Him. But there is no conception, because
there is no perception, of the substance of the Deity. Scripture, which has revealed His operations,
has not revealed that. “The human mind<gap reason="omitted"/>feels after the unutterable Being in
divers and many-sided ways; and never chases the mystery in the light of one idea alone.
Our grasping of Him would indeed be easy, if there lay before us one single assigned path
to the knowledge of God; but, as it is, from the skill apparent in the Universe, we get the
idea of skill in the Ruler of the Universe;<gap reason="omitted"/>and again, when we see the execrable character
of evil, we grasp His own unalterable pureness as regards this,<gap reason="omitted"/>not that we split up the
subject of such attributes along with them, but, believing that this Being, whatever it be in
substance, is one, we still conceive that it has something in common with all these ideas.”</p>
<p>To sum up, it had suited Eunomius to try to disparage ᾽Επίνοια so far as to make it appear
morally impossible that any name of God, but especially ᾽Αγέννητος, should be derived
from such a source. He scoffs at the orthodox party for treating the privative terms for the
Deity as merely privative, embodying only a “notion,” and for adhering to the truth that
God’s name is “above every name.” He “does not see how God can be above His works
simply by virtue of such things as do not belong to Him;” this is only “giving to words the
prerogative over realities.” He wants, and believes in the existence of, a word for the substance
of God, and he finds it in ᾽Αγέννητος, which according to him is not privative at all; it is the
single name for the single Deity, and all the others are bound up in it. “The universal
Guardian thought it right to engraft these names in our minds by a law of His creation.”
“These utterances are from above.” The importance of this word to the Anomoeans is obvious.
Gregory, as spokesman of the Nicene party, defends the efficacy of the mental operation of
conception to supply terms for the Deity, which, however, can none of them be final. God
is incomprehensible. At the same time there is a spiritual insight of God (an ἔννοια in fact)
which far surpasses Eunomius’ intellectual certainty (see note p. 256).</p>

<head>Answer to Eunomius’ Second Book1065.</head>
<p>The first part of my contentions against Eunomius has with God’s help been sufficiently
established in the preceding work, as all who will may see from what I have worked out,
how in that former part his fallacy has been completely exposed, and its falsehood has no
further force against the truth, except in the case of those who show a very shameless animus
against her. But since, like some robber’s ambuscade, he has got together a second work
against orthodoxy, again with God’s help the truth takes up arms through me against the
array of her enemies, commanding my arguments like a general and directing them at her
pleasure against the foe; following whose steps I shall boldly venture on the second part of
my contentions, nothing daunted by the array of falsehood, notwithstanding its display of
numerous arguments. For faithful is He who has promised that “a thousand shall be chased
by one,” and that “ten thousand shall be put to flight by two”1066, victory in battle being
due not to numbers, but to righteousness. For even as bulky Goliath, when he shook against
the Israelites that ponderous spear we read of, inspired no fear in his opponent, though a
shepherd and unskilled in the tactics of war, but having met him in fight loses his own head
by a direct reversal of his expectations, so our Goliath, the champion of this alien system,
stretching forth his blasphemy against his opponents as though his hand were on a naked
sword, and flashing the while with sophisms fresh from his whetstone, has failed to inspire
us, though no soldiers, with any fear of his prowess, or to find himself free to exult in the
dearth of adversaries; on the contrary, he has found us warriors improvised from the Lord’s
sheepfold, untaught in logical warfare, and thinking it no detriment to be so, but simply
slinging our plain, rude argument of truth against him. Since then, that shepherd who is in
the record, when he had cast down the alien with his sling, and broken his helmet with the
stone, so that it gaped under the violence of the blow, did not confine his valour to gazing
on his fallen foe, but running in upon him, and depriving him of his head, returns bearing
it as a trophy to his people, parading that braggart head through the host of his countrymen;
looking to this example it becomes us also to advance nothing daunted to the second part
<note type="footnote">1065 This Book is entitled in the Munich and Venice mss. “an Antirrhetic against Eunomius’ second Essay
(λόγον)”: in the Paris Editions as “Essay XII. (λόγος I B) of our Father among the Saints, Gregory of Nyssa
against Eunomius (1615), against Eunomius’ second Essay (1638).” The discrepance of number seems to have
arisen from the absence of any title to Book VI. in the Munich and Venice mss. But the Book preceding this, i.e.
Book XII., is named as such by the Paris Editt. of 1638: and cited elsewhere as such. Photius, after saying that
Gregory far excelled, in these books, Theodore (of Mopsuestia), and Sophronius, who also wrote against Eunomius,
particularly praises this last book.</note>

of our labours, but as far as possible to imitate David’s valour, and, like him, after the first
blow to plant our foot upon the fallen foe, so that enemy of the truth may be exhibited as
much as possible as a headless trunk. For separated as he is from the true faith he is far more
truly beheaded than that Philistine. For since Christ is the head of every man, as saith the
Apostle1067, and it is only reasonable that the believer alone should be so termed (for Christ,
I take it, cannot be the head of the unbelieving also), it follows that he who is severed from
the saving faith must be headless like Goliath, being severed from the true head by his own
sword which he had whetted against the truth; which head it shall be our task not to cut off,
but to show that it is cut off.</p>
<p>And let no one suppose that it is through pride or desire of human reputation that I go
down to this truceless and implacable warfare to engage with the foe. For if it were allowed
me to pass a peaceful life meddling with no one, it would be far enough from my disposition
to wantonly disturb my tranquillity, by voluntarily provoking and stirring up a war against
myself. But now that God’s city, the Church, is besieged, and the great wall of the faith is
shaken, battered by the encircling engines of heresy, and there is no small risk of the word
of the Lord being swept into captivity through their devilish onslaught, deeming it a
dreadful thing to decline taking part in the Christian conflict, I have not turned aside to repose,
but have looked on the sweat of toil as more honourable than the relaxation of repose,
knowing well that just as every man, as saith the Apostle, shall receive his own reward1068
according to his own labour, so as a matter of course he shall receive punishment for neglect
of labour proportioned to his strength. Accordingly I supported the first encounter in the
discussion with good courage, discharging from my shepherd’s scrip, i.e. from the teaching
of the Church, my natural and unpremeditated arguments for the subversion of this blasphemy,
needing not at all the equipment of arguments from profane sources to qualify me
for the contest; and now also I do not hang back from the second part of the encounter,
fixing my hope like great David1069 on Him “Who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers
to fight,” if haply the hand of the writer may in my case also be guided by Divine power to
the overthrow of these heretical opinions, and my fingers may serve for the overthrow of
their malignant array by directing my argument with skill and precision against the foe. But
as in human conflicts those who excel in valour and might, secured by their armour and
having previously acquired military skill by their training for facing danger, station themselves
at the head of their column, encountering danger for those ranged behind them, while the
rest of the company, though serving only to give an appearance of numbers, seem nevertheless,
if only by their serried shields, to conduce to the common good, so in these our conflicts

that noble soldier of Christ and vehement champion against the aliens, the mighty spiritual
warrior Basil—equipped as he is with the whole armour described by the Apostle, and secured
by the shield of faith, and ever holding before him that weapon of defence, the sword of the
spirit—fights in the van of the Lord’s host by his elaborated argument against this heresy,
alive and resisting and prevailing over the foe, while we the common herd, sheltering
ourselves beneath the shield of that champion of the faith, shall not hold back from any
conflicts within the compass of our power, according as our captain may lead us on against
the foe. As he, then, in his refutation of the false and untenable opinion maintained by this
heresy, affirms that “ungenerate” cannot be predicated of God except as a mere notion or
conception, whereof he has adduced proofs supported by common sense and the evidence
of Scripture, while Eunomius, the author of the heresy, neither falls in with his statements
nor is able to overturn them, but in his conflict with the truth, the more clearly the light of
true doctrine shines forth, the more, like nocturnal creatures, does he shun the light, and,
no longer able to find the sophistical hiding-places to which he is accustomed, he wanders
about at random, and getting into the labyrinth of falsehood goes round and round in the
same place, almost the whole of his second treatise being taken up with this empty trifling—it
is well accordingly that our battle with those opposed to us should take place on the same
ground whereon our champion by his own treatise has been our leader.</p>
<p>First of all, however, I think it advisable to run briefly over our own doctrinal views and
our opponent’s disagreement with them, so that our review of the propositions in question
may proceed methodically. Now the main point of Christian orthodoxy1070 is to believe
that the Only-begotten God, Who is the truth and the true light, and the power of God and
the life, is truly all that He is said to be, both in other respects and especially in this, that He
is God and the truth, that is to say, God in truth, ever being what He is conceived to be and
what He is called, Who never at any time was not, nor ever will cease to be, Whose being,
such as it is essentially, is beyond the reach of the curiosity that would try to comprehend
it. But to us, as saith the word of Wisdom,1071 He makes Himself known that He is “by the
greatness and beauty of His creatures proportionately” to the things that are known,
vouchsafing to us the gift of faith by the operations of His hands, but not the comprehension
of what He is. Whereas, then, such is the opinion prevailing among all Christians, (such at
least as are truly worthy of the appellation, those, I mean, who have been taught by the law
<note type="footnote">1070 εὐσεβείας. That this is the predominant idea in the word will be seen from the following definitions:
“Piety is a devout life joined with a right faith” (OEcumenius on 1 Tim. iv. p. 754). “Piety is the looking up to the
one only God, Who is believed to be and is the true God, and the life in accordance with this” (Eusebius, P. E.
i. p. 3). “Piety is the science of adoration” (Suidas).</note>

to worship nothing that is not very God, and by that very act of worship confess that the
Only-begotten is God in truth, and not a God falsely so called,) there arose this deadly blight
of the Church, bringing barrenness on the holy seeds of the faith, advocating as it does the
errors of Judaism, and partaking to a certain extent in the impiety of the Greeks. For in its
figment of a created God it advocates the error of the Greeks, and in not accepting the Son
it supports that of the Jews. This school, then, which would do away with the very Godhead
of the Lord and teach men to conceive of Him as a created being, and not that which the
Father is in essence and power and dignity, since these misty ideas find no support when
exposed on all sides to the light of truth, have overlooked all those names supplied by
Scripture for the glorification of God, and predicated in like manner of the Father and of
the Son, and have betaken themselves to the word “ungenerate,” a term fabricated by
themselves to throw contempt on the greatness of the Only-begotten God. For whereas an
orthodox confession teaches us to believe in the Only-begotten God so that all men should
honour the Son even as they honour the Father, these men, rejecting the orthodox terms
whereby the greatness of the Son is signified as on a par with the dignity of the Father, draw
from thence the beginnings and foundations of their heresy in regard to His Divinity. For
as the Only-begotten God, as the voice of the Gospel teaches, came forth from the Father
and is of Him, misrepresenting this doctrine by a change of terms, they make use of them
to rend the true faith in pieces. For whereas the truth teaches that the Father is from no preexisting
cause, these men have given to such a view the name of “ungeneracy,” and signify
the substance of the Only-begotten from the Father by the term “generation,”—then comparing
the two terms “ungenerate” and “generate” as contradictories to each other, they
make use of the opposition to mislead their senseless followers. For, to make the matter
clearer by an illustration, the expressions, He was generated and He was not generated, are
much the same as, He is seated and He is not seated, and all such-like expressions. But they,
forcing these expressions away from the natural significance of the terms, are eager to put
another meaning upon them with a view to the subversion of orthodoxy. For whereas, as
has been said, the words “is seated” and “is not seated” are not equivalent in meaning (the
one expression being contradictory of the other), they pretend that this formal contradiction
in expression indicates an essential difference, ascribing generation to the Son and nongeneration
to the Father as their essential attributes. Yet, as it is impossible to regard a man’s
sitting down or not as the essence of the man (for one would not use the same definition
for a man’s sitting as for the man himself), so, by the analogy of the above example, the nongenerated
essence is in its inherent idea something wholly different from the thing expressed
by “not having been generated.” But our opponents, with an eye to their evil object, that of
establishing their denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten, do not say that the essence
of the Father is ungenerate, but, conversely, they declare ungeneracy to be His essence, in
order that by this distinction in regard to generation they may establish, by the verbal op-

<pb n="482"/>
position, a diversity of natures. In the direction of impiety they look with ten thousand eyes,
but with regard to the impracticability of their own contention they are as incapable of vision
as men who deliberately close their eyes. For who but one whose mental optics are utterly
purblind can fail to discern the loose and unsubstantial character of the principle of their
doctrine, and that their argument in support of ungeneracy as an essence has nothing to
stand upon? For this is the way in which their error would establish itself.</p>
<p>But to the best of my ability I will raise my voice to rebut our enemies’ argument. They
say that God is declared to be without generation, that the Godhead is by nature simple,
and that which is simple admits of no composition. If, then, God Who is declared to be
without generation is by His nature without composition, His title of Ungenerate must belong
to His very nature, and that nature is identical with ungeneracy. To whom we reply that the
terms incomposite and ungenerate are not the same thing, for the former represents the
simplicity of the subject, the other its being without origin, and these expressions are not
convertible in meaning, though both are predicated of one subject. But from the appellation
of Ungenerate we have been taught that He Who is so named is without origin, and from
the appellation of simple that He is free from all admixture (or composition), and these
terms cannot be substituted for each other. There is therefore no necessity that, because the
Godhead is by its nature simple, that nature should be termed ungeneracy; but in that He
is indivisible and without composition, He is spoken of as simple, while in that He was not
generated, He is spoken of as ungenerate.</p>
<p>Now if the term ungenerate did not signify the being without origin, but the idea of
simplicity entered into the meaning of such a term, and He were called ungenerate in their
heretical sense, merely because He is simple and incomposite, and if the terms simple and
ungenerate are the same in meaning, then too must the simplicity of the Son be equivalent
with ungeneracy. For they will not deny that God the Only-begotten is by His nature simple,
unless they are prepared to deny that He is God. Accordingly the term simplicity will in its
meaning have no such connection with being ungenerate as that, by reason of its incomposite
character, His nature should be termed ungeneracy; or they draw upon themselves one of
two absurd alternatives, either denying the Godhead of the Only-begotten, or attributing
ungeneracy to Him also. For if God is simple, and the term simplicity is, according to them,
identical with ungenerate, they must either make out the Son to be of composite nature, by
which term it is implied that neither is He God, or if they allow His Godhead, and God (as
I have said) is simple, then they make Him out at the same time to be ungenerate, if the
terms simple and ungenerate are convertible. But to make my meaning clearer I will recapitulate.
We affirm that each of these terms has its own peculiar meaning, and that the term
indivisible cannot be rendered by ungenerate, nor ungenerate by simple; but by simple we
understand uncompounded, and by ungenerate we are taught to understand what is without
origin. Furthermore we hold that we are bound to believe that the Son of God, being Himself

<pb n="483"/>
God, is Himself also simple, because God is free from all compositeness; and in like manner
in speaking of Him also by the appellation of Son we neither denote simplicity of substance,
nor in simplicity do we include the notion of Son, but the term Son we hold to indicate that
He is of the substance of the Father, and the term simple we hold to mean what the word
bears upon its face. Since, then, the meaning of the term simple in regard to essence is one
and the same whether spoken of the Father or of the Son, differing in no degree, while there
is a wide difference between generate and ungenerate (the one containing a notion not
contained in the other), for this reason we assert that there is no necessity that, the Father
being ungenerate, His essence should, because that essence is simple, be defined by the term
ungenerate. For neither of the Son, Who is simple, and Whom also we believe to be generated,
do we say that His essence is simplicity. But as the essence is simple and not simplicity, so
also the essence is ungenerate and not ungeneracy. In like manner also the Son being generated,
our reason is freed from any necessity that, because His essence is simple, we should
define that essence as generateness; but here again each expression has its peculiar force.
For the term generated suggests to you a source whence, and the term simple implies freedom
from composition. But this does not approve itself to them. For they maintain that since
the essence of the Father is simple, it cannot be considered as other than ungeneracy; on
which account also He is said to be ungenerate. In answer to whom we may also observe
that, since they call the Father both Creator and Maker, whereas He Who is so called is
simple in regard to His essence, it is high time for such sophists to declare the essence of
the Father to be creation and making, since the argument about simplicity introduces into
His essence any signification of any name we give Him. Either, then, let them separate ungeneracy
from the definition of the Divine essence, allowing the term no more than its
proper signification, or, if by reason of the simplicity of the subject they define His essence
by the term ungeneracy, by a parity of reasoning let them likewise see creation and making
in the essence of the Father, not as though the power residing in the essence created and
made, but as though the power itself meant creation and making. But if they reject this as
bad and absurd, let them be persuaded by what logically follows to reject the other proposition
as well. For as the essence of the builder is not the thing built, no more is ungeneracy
the essence of the Ungenerate. But for the sake of clearness and conciseness I will restate
my arguments. If the Father is called ungenerate, not by reason of His having never been
generated, but because His essence is simple and incomposite, by a parity of reasoning the
Son also must be called ungenerate, for He too is a simple and incomposite essence. But if
we are compelled to confess the Son to be generated because He was generated, it is manifest
that we must address the Father as ungenerate, because He was not generated. But if we are
compelled to this conclusion by truth and the force of our premises, it is clear that the term
ungenerate is no part of the essence, but is indicative of a difference of conceptions, distinguishing
that which is generated from that which is ungenerate. But let us discuss this point

<pb n="484"/>
also in addition to what I have said. If they affirm that the term ungenerate signifies the essence1072
(of the Father), and not that He has His substance without origin, what term will
they use to denote the Father’s being without origin, when they have set aside the term ungenerate
to indicate His essence? For if we are not taught the distinguishing difference of
the Persons by the term ungenerate, but are to regard it as indicating His very nature as
flowing in a manner from the subject-matter, and disclosing what we seek in articulate syllables,
it must follow that God is not, or is not to be called, ungenerate, there being no word
left to express such peculiar significance in regard to Him. For inasmuch as according to
them the term ungenerate does not mean without origin, but indicates the Divine nature,
their argument will be found to exclude it altogether, and the term ungenerate slips out of
their teaching in respect to God. For there being no other word or term to represent that
the Father is ungenerate, and that term signifying, according to their fallacious argument,
something else, and not that He was not generated, their whole argument falls and collapses
into Sabellianism. For by this reasoning we must hold the Father to be identical with the
Son, the distinction between generated and ungenerate having been got rid of from their
teaching, so that they are driven to one of two alternatives: either they must again adopt the
view of the term as denoting a difference in the attributes proper to either Person, and not
as denoting the nature, or, abiding by their conclusions as to the word, they must side with
Sabellius. For it is impossible that the difference of the persons should be without confusion,
unless there be a distinction between generated and ungenerate. Accordingly if the term
denotes difference, essence will in no way be denoted by the appellation. For the definitions
of difference and essence are by no means the same. But if they divert the meaning of the
<note type="footnote">1072 Essence, substance, οὐσία. Most of this controversy might have been avoided by agreeing to banish the
word οὐσία entirely from this sort of connection with the Deity. Even Celsus the Neo-platonist had said, “God
does not partake of substance” (οὐσίας). “Exactly,” Origen replies, “God is partaken of, viz., by those who have
His spirit, rather than partakes of anything Himself. Indeed, the subject of substance involves questions complicated
and difficult to decide; most especially on this point. Supposing, that is, an absolute Substance, motionless,
incorporeal, is God beyond this Substance in rank and power, granting a share of it to those to whom according
to His Word He chooses to communicate it? Or is He Himself this Substance, though described as invisible in
that passage about the Saviour (Coloss. i. 15) ‘Who is the image of the invisible God,’ where invisible means incorporeal?
Another point is this: is the Only-Begotten and First-Born of all Creatures to be pronounced the
Substance of substances, the Original Idea of all ideas, while the Father God Himself is beyond all these?” (c.
Cels. vi. 64). (Such a question as this last, however, could not have been asked a century later, when Athanasius
had dispelled all traces of Neo-platonic subordination from the Christian Faith. Uncreated Spirit, not Invisible
First Substance, is the mark of all in the Triune-God. But the effort of Neo-platonism to rise above every term
that might seem to include the Deity had not been thrown away. Even “God is Spirit” is only a conception, not
a definition, of the Deity; while “God is substance” ought to be regarded as an actual contradiction in terms.)</note>

<pb n="485"/>
word so as to signify nature, they must be drawn into the heresy of those who are called
“Son-Fathers1073,” all accuracy of definition in regard to the Persons being rejected from
their account. But if they say that there is nothing to hinder the distinction between generated
and ungenerate from being rendered by the term ungenerate, and that term represents the
essence too, let them distinguish for us the kindred meanings of the word, so that the notion
of ungenerate may properly apply to either of them taken by itself. For the expression of
the difference by means of this term involves no ambiguity, consisting as it does of a verbal
opposition. For as an equivalent to saying “The Son has, and the Father has not, been generated,”
we too assent to the statement that the latter is ungenerate and the former generated,
by a sort of verbal correlation. But from what point of view a clear manifestation of essence
can be made by this appellation, this they are unable to say. But keeping silence on this head,
our novel theologian weaves us a web of trifling subtleties in his former treatise. Because
God, saith he, being simple, is called ungenerate, therefore God is ungeneracy. What has
the notion of simplicity to do with the idea of ungenerate? For not only is the Only-begotten
generated, but, without controversy, He is simple also. But, saith he, He is without parts
also, and incomposite. But what is this to the point? For neither is the Son multiform and
composite: and yet He is not on that account ungenerate.</p>
<p>But, saith he, He is without both quantity and magnitude. Granted: for the Son also is
unlimited by quantity and magnitude, and yet is He the Son. But this is not the point. For
the task set before us is this: in what signification of ungenerate is essence declared? For as
this word marks the difference of the properties, so they maintain that the essence also is
indicated without ambiguity by one of the things signified by the appellation.</p>
<p>But this thing he leaves untold, and only says that ungeneracy should not be predicated
of God as a mere conception. For what is so spoken, saith he, is dissolved, and passes away
with its utterance. But what is there that is uttered but is so dissolved? For we do not keep
undissolved, like those who make pots or bricks, what we utter with our voice in the mould
of the speech which we form once for all with our lips, but as soon as one speech has been
sent forth by our voice, what we have said ceases to exist. For the breath of our voice being
dispersed again into the air, no trace of our words is impressed upon the spot in which such
dispersion of our voice has taken place: so that if he makes this the distinguishing characteristic
of a term that expresses a mere conception, that it does not remain, but vanishes with
the voice that gives it utterance, he may as well at once call every term a mere conception,
inasmuch as no substance remains in any term subsequent to its utterance. No, nor will he
be able to show that ungeneracy itself, which he excepts from the products of conception,
<note type="footnote">1073 i.e.who hold the Father and the Son to be one and the same Person, i.e. Sabellians. “He here overthrows
the heresy of Sabellius, by marking the persons of the Father and the Son: for the Church does not imagine a
Son-Fatherhood (υἰοπατορίαν), such as the figment of that African” (Ammonius caten. ad Joh. I. i. p. 14).</note>

<pb n="486"/>
is indissoluble and fixed when it has been uttered, for this expression of the voice through
the lips does not abide in the air. And from this we may see the unsubstantial character of
his assertions; because, even if without speech we describe in writing our mental conceptions,
it is not as though the substantial objects of our thoughts will acquire their significance from
the letters, while the non-substantial will have no part in what the letters express. For
whatever comes into our mind, whether intellectually existing, or otherwise, it is possible
for us at our discretion to store away in writing. And the voice and letters are of equal value
for the expression of thought, for we communicate what we think by the latter as well as by
the former. What he sees, then, to justify his making the mental conception perish with the
voice only, I fail to comprehend. For in the case of all speech uttered by means of sound,
the passage of the breath indeed which conveys the voice is towards its kindred element,
but the sense of the words spoken is engraved by hearing on the memory of the hearer’s
soul, whether it be true or false. Is not this, then, a weak interpretation of this “conception”
of his that our writer offers, when he characterizes and defines it by the dissolution of the
voice? And for this reason the understanding hearer, as saith Isaiah, objects to this inconceivable
account of mental conception, showing it, to use the man’s own words, to be a
veritably dissoluble and unsubstantial one, and he discusses scientifically the force inherent
in the term, advancing his argument by familiar examples to the contemplation of doctrine.
Against whom Eunomius exalting himself with this pompous writing, endeavours to overthrow
the true account of mental conception, after this manner.</p>
<p>But before we examine what he has written, it may be better to enquire with what purpose
it is that he refuses to admit that ungenerate can be predicated of God by way of conception.
Now the tenet which has been held in common by all who have received the word of our
religion is, that all hope of salvation should be placed in Christ, it being impossible for any
to be found among the righteous, unless faith in Christ supply what is desired. And this
conviction being firmly established in the souls of the faithful, and all honour and glory and
worship being due to the Only-begotten God as the Author of life, Who doeth the works of
the Father, as the Lord Himself saith in the Gospel1074, and Who falls short of no excellence
in all knowledge of that which is good, I know not how they have been so perverted by malignity
and jealousy of the Lord’s honour, that, as though they judged the worship paid by
the faithful to the Only-begotten God to be a detriment to themselves, they oppose His Divine
honours, and try to persuade us that nothing that is said of them is true. For with them
neither is He very God, though called so, it would seem, by Scripture, nor, though called
Son, has He a nature that makes good the appellation, nor has He a community of dignity
or of nature with the Father. For, say they, it is not possible for Him that is begotten to be
of equal honour with Him Who made Him, either in dignity, or in power, or in nature, be-

cause the life of the latter is infinite, and His existence from eternity, while the life of the
Son is in a manner circumscribed, the beginning of His being begotten limiting His life at
the commencement, and preventing it from being coextensive with the eternity of the
Father, so that His life also is to be regarded as defective; and the Father was not always what
He now is and is said to be, but, having been something else before, He afterwards determined
that He would be a Father, or rather that He would be so called. For not even of the Son was
He rightly called Father, but of a creature supposititiously invested with the title of son. And
every way, say they, the younger is of necessity inferior to the elder, the finite to the eternal,
that which is begotten by the will of the begetter, to the begetter himself, both in power, and
dignity, and nature, and precedence due to age, and all other prerogatives of respect. But
how can we justly dignify with the honours due to the true God that which is wanting in
the perfection of the diviner attributes? Thus they would establish the doctrine that one who
is limited in power, and wanting in the perfection of life, and subject to a superior, and doing
nothing of himself but what is sanctioned by the authority of the more powerful, is in no
divine honour and consideration, but that, while we call him God, we are employing a term
empty of all grandeur in its significance. And since such statements as these, when stripped
of their plausible dress, move indignation and make the hearer shudder at their strangeness
(for who can tolerate an evil counsellor nakedly and unadvisably urging the overthrow of
the majesty of Christ?), they therefore try to pervert foolish hearers with these foreign notions
by enveloping their malignant and insidious arguments in a number of seductive fallacies.</p>
<p>For after laying down such premises as might naturally lead the mind of the hearers in the
desired direction, they leave the hearer to draw his conclusion for himself.
For after saying that the Only-begotten God is not the same in essence with the true
Father, and after sophistically inferring this from the opposition between generate and ungenerate,
they work in silence to the conclusion, their impiety prevailing by the natural
course of inference. And as the poisoner makes his drug acceptable to his victim by sweetening
its deadliness with honey, and, as for himself, has only to offer it, while the drug insinuating
itself into the vitals without further action on the part of the poisoner does its
deadly work,—so, too, do our opponents act. For qualifying their pernicious teaching with
their sophistical refinements, as with honey, when they have infused into the mind of the
hearer the venomous fallacy that God the Only-begotten is not very God, they cause all the
rest to be inferred without saying a word. For when they are persuaded that He is not truly

<pb n="488"/>
if He is truly neither Son nor God, except by an abuse of terms, then the other names which
are given to Him in Holy Scripture are a divergence from the truth. For the one thing cannot
be predicated of Him with truth, and the other be destitute of it; but they must needs follow
one another, so that, if He be truly God, it follows that He is Judge and King, and that His
several attributes are such as they are described, while, if His godhead be falsely asserted,
Answer to Eunomius' Second Book.
neither will the truth hold respecting any of His other attributes. They, then, having been
deceived into the persuasion that the attribute of Godhead is falsely applied to the Onlybegotten,
it follows that He is not rightly the object of worship and adoration, or, in fact, of
any of the honours that are paid to God. In order, then, to render their attack upon the Saviour
efficacious, this is the blasphemous method that they have adopted. There is no need,
they urge, of looking at the collective attributes by which the Son’s equality in honour and
dignity with the Father is signified, but from the opposition between generate and ungenerate
we must argue a distinctive difference of nature; for the Divine nature is that which is denoted
by the term ungenerate. Again, since all men of sense regard it as impracticable to indicate
the ineffable Being by any force of words, because neither does our knowledge extend to
the comprehension of what transcends knowledge, nor does the ministry of words have
such power in us as to avail for the full enunciation of our thought, where the mind is engaged
on anything eminently lofty and divine,—these wise folk, on the contrary, convicting men
in general of want of sense and ignorance of logic, assert their own knowledge of such
matters, and their ability to impart it to whomsoever they will; and accordingly they maintain
that the divine nature is simply ungeneracy per se, and declaring this to be sovereign and
supreme, they make this word comprehend the whole greatness of Godhead, so as to necessitate
the inference that if ungeneracy is the main point of the essence, and the other divine
attributes are bound up with it, viz. Godhead, power, imperishableness and so on—if (I say)
ungeneracy mean these, then, if this ungeneracy cannot be predicated of something, neither
can the rest. For as reason, and risibility, and capacity of knowledge are proper to man, and
what is not humanity may not be classed among the properties of his nature, so, if true
Godhead consists in ungeneracy, then, to whatsoever thing the latter name does not properly
belong, no one at all of the other distinguishing attributes of Godhead will be found in it.
If, then, ungeneracy is not predicable of the Son, it follows that no other of His sublime and
godlike attributes are properly ascribed to Him. This, then, they define as a right comprehension
of the divine mysteries—the rejection of the Son’s Godhead—all but shouting in
the ear of those who would listen to them; “To you it is given to be perfect in knowledge1075,
<note type="footnote">1075 Eunomius arrived at the same conclusions as Arius, but by a different path. “The true name of God is
᾽Αγέννητος, and this name is incommunicable to other essences.” He attacked both the Arians and the orthodox.
The former he reproached for saying that we can know God only in part: the latter for saying that we know God
only through the Universe, and the Son, the Author of the Universe. He maintained, on the contrary, that it was
unworthy of a Christian to profess the impossibility of knowing the Divine Nature, and the manner in which
the Son is generated. Rather, the mind of the believer rises above every sensible and intelligible essence, and
does not stop even at the generation of the Son, but mounts above, aspiring to possess the First Cause. Is this
bold assertion, Denys (De la Philosophie d’Origène, p. 446) asks, so contrary as it is to the teaching of the Fathers,
a reminiscence of Origen, or a direct borrowing from Plato or the Neoplatonists? The language in which it is
expressed certainly belongs to the latter (ὑποκύψας, ἐπέκεινα, πόθος, τὸ πρῶτον, γλιχόμενος): but Origen</note>

<pb n="489"/>
if only you believe not in God the Only-begotten as being very God, and honour not the
Son as the Father is honoured, but regard Him as by nature a created being, not Lord and
Master, but slave and subject.” For this is the aim and object of their design, though the
blasphemy is cloaked in different terms.</p>
<p>Accordingly, enveloping his former special-pleading in the mazy evolutions of his
sophistries, and dealing subtly with the term ungenerate, he steals away the intelligence of
his dupes, saying to them, "Well, then, if neither by way of conception it is so, nor by
deprivation, nor by division (for He is without parts), nor as being another in Himself1076
(for He is the one only ungenerate), He Himself must be, in essence, ungenerate.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, the mischief resulting to the dupes of this fallacious reasoning—that to
assent to His not being very God is a departure from our confession of Him as our Lord, to
which conclusion indeed his words would bring his teaching—our master does not indeed
deny that ungenerate is no partial predicate of God, himself also admitting that God is
without quantity, or magnitude, or parts; but the statement that this term ought not to be
applied to Him by way of mental conception he impugns, and gives his proofs. But again,
shifting from this position, our writer in the second of his treatises meets us with his sophistry,
combating his own statements in regard to mental conception.</p>
<p>It will presently be time to bring to their own recollection the method of this argument.
Suffice it first to say this. There is no faculty in human nature adequate to the full comprehension
of the divine essence. It may be that it is easy to show this in the case of human capacity
alone, and to say that the incorporeal creation is incapable of taking in and comprehending
that nature which is infinite will not be far short of the truth, as we may see by familiar
examples; for as there are many and various things that have fleshly life, winged
things, and things of the earth, some that mount above the clouds by virtue of their wings,
others that dwell in hollows or burrow in the ground, on comparing which it would appear
<note type="footnote">himself, less wise in this matter than Clement, was not far from believing that there was a Way above Him Whom
S. John calls the Way, a Light above the Light that “lighteth every man that cometh into the world,” an “Eternal
Gospel” above the present Gospel; and that these were not inaccessible at once to human creatures. Only they
could not be reached in themselves, and without a Mediator, until Christ, having vanquished His enemies, had
given back the kingdom to the Father, and God was “all in all.”—This doctrine of the ᾽Αγέννητος, then, made
it necessary for Basil and Gregory to throw their whole weight against Eunomius, rather than against Macedonius,
who, as inconsequent through not dealing alike with the Second and Third Person, could not be so dangerous
an enemy.</note>
<note type="footnote">1076 As being another. Oehler reads ὡς ἕτερον: the Paris editt. have ἐστιν ἕτερον, due to the correction of
John the Franciscan, whose ms., however, (the Pithoean) had ὥστε (ὥς τι?). These words of Eunomius are found
in Basil lib. i c. Eunomium, tom. i. p. 711 (Paris 1638), even more fully quoted than here: and ὡς ἕτερον is found

that there was no small difference between the inhabitants of air and of land; while, if the
comparison be extended to the stars and the fixed circumference, it will be seen that what
soars aloft on wings is not less widely removed from heaven than from the animals that are
on the earth; so, too, the strength of angels compared with our own seems preeminently
great, because, undisturbed by sensation, it pursues its lofty themes with pure naked intelligence.
Yet, if we weigh even their comprehension with the majesty of Him Who really is, it
may be that if any one should venture to say that even their power of understanding is not
far superior to our own weakness, his conjecture would fall within the limits of probability,
for wide and insurmountable is the interval that divides and fences off uncreated from created
nature. The latter is limited, the former not. The latter is confined within its own boundaries
according to the pleasure of its Maker. The former is bounded only by infinity. The latter
stretches itself out within certain degrees of extension, limited by time and space: the former
transcends all notion of degree, baffling curiosity from every point of view. In this life we
can apprehend the beginning and the end of all things that exist, but the beatitude that is
above the creature admits neither end nor beginning, but is above all that is connoted by
either, being ever the same, self-dependent, not travelling on by degrees from one point to
another in its life; for there is no participation of other life in its life, such that we might infer
end and beginning; but, be it what it may, it is life energizing in itself, not becoming greater
or less by addition or diminution. For increase has no place in the infinite, and that which
is by its nature passionless excludes all notion of decrease. And as, when looking up to
heaven, and in a measure apprehending by the visual organs the beauty that is in the height,
we doubt not the existence of what we see, but if asked what it is, we are unable to define
its nature, but we simply admire as we contemplate the overarching vault, the reverse
planetary motion1077, the so-called Zodiac graven obliquely on the pole, whereby astronomers
observe the motion of bodies revolving in an opposite direction, the differences of luminaries
according to their magnitude, and the specialities of their rays, their risings and settings
that take place according to the circling year ever at the same seasons undeviatingly, the
conjunctions of planets, the courses of those that pass below, the eclipses of those that are
above, the obumbrations of the earth, the reappearance of eclipsed bodies, the moon’s
multiform changes, the motion of the sun midway within the poles, and how, filled with his
own light, and crowned with his encircling beams, and embracing all things in his sovereign
<note type="footnote">1077 Gregory here refers to the apparent “retrograde” motion of the planets, i.e. that, while passing through
part of their orbits, they appear to us to move in a direction contrary to the order of the Zodiac. In what follows
he represents the views of the ancient astronomy, imagining a series of concentric spheres, allotted to the several
planets, the planetary motions being accomplished by the rotation of the spheres. Beyond the planetary spheres
is the sphere allotted to the fixed stars, within which the others revolve. See Gale, Opusc. Mythol. (1688), p 550;
and Introduction to Colet’s Lectures on Corinthians, pp. xl–xliii.</note>

light, he himself also at times suffers eclipse (the disc of the moon, as they say, passing before
him), and how, by the will of Him Who has so ordained, ever running his own particular
course, he accomplishes his appointed orbit and progress, opening out the four seasons of
the year in succession; we, as I say, when we contemplate these phenomena by the aid of
sight, are in no doubt of their existence, though we are as far from comprehending their
essential nature as if sight had not given us any glimpse whatever of what we have seen; and
even so, with regard to the Creator of the world, we know that He exists, but of His essential
nature we cannot deny that we are ignorant. But, boasting as they do that they know these
things, let them first tell us about the things of inferior nature; what they think of the body
of the heavens, of the machinery which conveys the stars in their eternal courses, or of the
sphere in which they move; for, however far speculation may proceed, when it comes to the
uncertain and incomprehensible it must stop. For though any one say that another body,
like in fashion (to that body of the heavens), fitting to its circular shape, checks its velocity,
so that, ever turning in its course, it revolves conformably to that other upon itself, being
retained by the force that embraces it from flying off at a tangent, yet how can he assert that
these bodies will remain unspent by their constant friction with each other? And how, again,
is motion produced in the case of two coeval bodies mutually conformed, when the one remains
motionless (for the inner body, one would have thought, being held as in a vice by
the motionlessness of that which embraces it, will be quite unable to act); and what is it that
maintains the embracing body in its fixedness, so that it remains unshaken and unaffected
by the motion of that which fits into it? And if in restless curiosity of thought we should
conceive of some position for it that should keep it stationary, we must go on in logical
consistency to search for the base of that base, and of the next, and of the next, and so on,
and so the inquiry, proceeding from like to like, will go on to infinity, and end in helpless
perplexity, still, even when some body has been put for the farthest foundation of the system
of the universe, reaching after what is beyond, so that there is no stopping in our inquiry
after the limit of the embracing circles. But not so, say others: but (according to the vain
theory of those who have speculated on these matters) there is an empty space spread over
the back of the heavens, working in which vacuum the motion of the universe revolves upon
itself, meeting with no resistance from any solid body capable of retarding it by opposition
and of checking its course of revolution. What, then, is that vacuum, which they say is neither
a body nor an idea? How far does it extend, and what succeeds it, and what relation exists
between the firm, resisting body, and that void and unsubstantial one? What is there to
unite things so contrary by nature? and how can the harmony of the universe consist out
of elements so incongruous; and what can any one say of Heaven itself? That it is a mixture
of the elements which it contains, or one of them, or something else beside them? What,
again, of the stars themselves? whence comes their radiance? what is it and how is it composed?
and what is the reason of their difference in beauty and magnitude? and the seven

<pb n="492"/>
inner orbs revolving in an opposite direction to the motion of the universe, what are they,
and by what influence are they propelled? Then, too, what is that immaterial and ethereal
empyrean, and the intermediate air which forms a wall of partition between that element
in nature which gives heat and consumes, and that which is moist and combustible? And
how does earth below form the foundation of the whole, and what is it that keeps it firmly
in its place? what is it that controls its downward tendency? If any one should interrogate
us on these and such-like points, will any of us be found so presumptuous as to promise an
explanation of them? No! the only reply that can be given by men of sense is this:—that He
Who made all things in wisdom can alone furnish an account of His creation. For ourselves,
“through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,” as saith
the Apostle1078.</p>
<p>If, then, the lower creation which comes under our organs of sense transcends human
knowledge, how can He, Who by His mere will made the worlds, be within the range of our
apprehension? Surely this is vanity, and lying madness, as saith the Prophet1079, to think it
possible to comprehend the things which are incomprehensible. So may we see tiny children
busying themselves in their play. For oft-times, when a sunbeam streams down upon them
through a window, delighted with its beauty they throw themselves on what they see, and
are eager to catch the sunbeam in their hands, and struggle with one another, and grasp the
light in the clutch of their fingers, and fancy they have imprisoned the ray in them, but
presently when they unclasp their hands and find that the sunbeam which they held has
slipped through their fingers, they laugh and clap their hands. In like manner the children
of our generation, as saith the parable, sit playing in the market-places; for, seeing the power
of God shining in upon their souls through the dispensations of His providence, and the
wonders of His creation like a warm ray emanating from the natural sun, they marvel not
at the Divine gift, nor adore Him Whom such things reveal, but passing beyond the limits
of the soul’s capabilities, they seek with their sophistical understanding to grasp that which
is intangible, and think by their reasonings to lay hold of what they are persuaded of; but
when their argument unfolds itself and discloses the tangled web of their sophistries, men
of discernment see at once that what they have apprehended is nothing at all; so pettily and
so childishly labouring in vain at impossibilities do they set themselves to include the inconceivable
nature of God in the few syllables of the term “ungenerate,” and applaud their own
folly, and imagine God to be such that human reasoning can include Him under one single
term: and while they pretend to follow the teaching of the sacred writers, they are not afraid
of raising themselves above them. For what cannot be shown to have been said by any of
those blessed ones, any words of whose are recorded in the sacred books, these things, as
<note type="footnote">1078 Heb. i. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1079 The thought is found in Psalm xxxix. 6.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
saith the Apostle, “understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm1080,” they
nevertheless say they know, and boast of guiding others to such knowledge. And on this
account they declare that they have apprehended that God the Only-begotten is not what
He is called. For to this conclusion they are compelled by their premises.</p>
<p>How pitiable are they for their cleverness! how wretched, how fatal is their over-wise
philosophy! Who is there who goes of his own accord to the pit so eagerly as these men labour
and bestir themselves to dig out their lake of blasphemy? How far have they separated
themselves from the hope of the Christian! What a gulf have they fixed between themselves
and the faith which saves! How far have they withdrawn themselves from Abraham the
father of the faith! He indeed, if in the lofty spirit of the Apostle we may take the words allegorically,
and so penetrate to the inner sense of the history, without losing sight of the
truth of its facts—he, I say, went out by Divine command from his own country and kindred
on a journey worthy of a prophet eager for the knowledge of God1081. For no local migration
seems to me to satisfy the idea of the blessings which it is signified that he found. For going
out from himself and from his country, by which I understand his earthly and carnal mind,
and raising his thoughts as far as possible above the common boundaries of nature, and
forsaking the soul’s kinship with the senses,—so that untroubled by any of the objects of
sense his eyes might be open to the things which are invisible, there being neither sight nor
sound to distract the mind in its work,—“walking,” as saith the Apostle, “by faith, not by
sight,” he was raised so high by the sublimity of his knowledge that he came to be regarded
as the acme of human perfection, knowing as much of God as it was possible for finite human
capacity at its full stretch to attain. Therefore also the Lord of all creation, as though He
were a discovery of Abraham, is called specially the God of Abraham. Yet what saith the
Scripture respecting him? That he went out not knowing whither he went, no, nor even
being capable of learning the name of Him whom he loved, yet in no wise impatient or
ashamed on account of such ignorance.</p>
<p>This, then, was the meaning of his safe guidance on the way to what he sought—that
he was not blindly led by any of the means ready to hand for his instruction in the things
of God, and that his mind, unimpeded by any object of sense, was never hindered from its
journeying in quest of what lies beyond all that is known, but having gone by reasoning far
beyond the wisdom of his countrymen, (I mean the philosophy of the Chaldees, limited as
it was to the things which do appear,) and soaring above the things which are cognizable
by sense, from the beauty of the objects of contemplation, and the harmony of the heavenly
wonders, he desired to behold the archetype of all beauty. And so, too, all the other things
which in the course of his reasoning he was led to apprehend as he advanced, whether the

<pb n="494"/>
power of God, or His goodness, or His being without beginning, or His infinity, or whatever
else is conceivable in respect to the divine nature, using them all as supplies and appliances
for his onward journey, ever making one discovery a stepping-stone to another, ever
reaching forth unto those things which were before, and setting in his heart, as saith the
Prophet, each fair stage of his advance1082, and passing by all knowledge acquired by his
own ability as falling short of that of which he was in quest, when he had gone beyond every
conjecture respecting the divine nature which is suggested by any name amongst all our
conceptions of God, having purged his reason of all such fancies, and arrived at a faith unalloyed
and free from all prejudice, he made this a sure and manifest token of the knowledge
of God, viz. the belief that He is greater and more sublime than any token by which He may
be known. On this account, indeed, after the ecstasy which fell upon him, and after his
sublime meditations, falling back on his human weakness, “I am,” saith he, “but dust and
ashes1083,” that is to say, without voice or power to interpret that good which his mind had
conceived. For dust and ashes seem to denote what is lifeless and barren; and so there arises
a law of faith for the life to come, teaching those who would come to God, by this history
of Abraham, that it is impossible to draw near to God, unless faith mediate, and bring the
seeking soul into union with the incomprehensible nature of God. For leaving behind him
the curiosity that arises from knowledge, Abraham, says the Apostle, “believed God, and it
was counted unto him for righteousness1084.” “Now it was not written for his sake,” the
Apostle says, “but for us,” that God counts to men for righteousness their faith, not their
knowledge. For knowledge acts, as it were, in a commercial spirit, dealing only with what
is known. But the faith of Christians acts otherwise. For it is the substance, not of things
known, but of things hoped for. Now that which we have already we no longer hope for.
“For what a man hath,” says the Apostle, “why doth he yet hope for1085”? But faith makes
our own that which we see not, assuring us by its own certainty of that which does not appear.
For so speaks the Apostle of the believer, that “he endured as seeing Him Who is invis-
ible1086.” Vain, therefore, is he who maintains that it is possible to take knowledge of the
divine essence, by the knowledge which puffeth up to no purpose. For neither is there any
man so great that he can claim equality in understanding with the Lord, for, as saith David,
“Who is he among the clouds that shall be compared unto the Lord?1087” nor is that which
is sought so small that it can be compassed by the reasonings of human shallowness. Listen

to the preacher exhorting not to be hasty to utter anything before God, “for God,” (saith
he,) “is in heaven above, and thou upon earth beneath1088.”</p>
<p>He shows, I think, by the relation of these elements to each other, or rather by their
distance, how far the divine nature is above the speculations of human reason. For that
nature which transcends all intelligence is as high above earthly calculation as the stars are
above the touch of our fingers; or rather, many times more than that.</p>
<p>Knowing, then, how widely the Divine nature differs from our own, let us quietly remain
within our proper limits. For it is both safer and more reverent to believe the majesty of
God to be greater than we can understand, than, after circumscribing His glory by our
misconceptions, to suppose there is nothing beyond our conception of it.</p>
<p>And on other accounts also it may be called safe to let alone the Divine essence, as unspeakable,
and beyond the scope of human reasoning. For the desire of investigating what
is obscure and tracing out hidden things by the operation of human reasoning gives an entrance
to false no less than to true notions, inasmuch as he who aspires to know the unknown
will not always arrive at truth, but may also conceive of falsehood itself as truth. But the
disciple of the Gospels and of Prophecy believes that He Who is, is; both from what he has
learnt from the sacred writers, and from the harmony of things which do appear, and from
the works of Providence. But what He is and how—leaving this as a useless and unprofitable
speculation, such a disciple will open no door to falsehood against truth. For in speculative
enquiry fallacies readily find place. But where speculation is entirely at rest, the necessity of
error is precluded. And that this is a true account of the case, may be seen if we consider
how it is that heresies in the churches have wandered off into many and various opinions
in regard to God, men deceiving themselves as they are swayed by one mental impulse or
another; and how these very men with whom our treatise is concerned have slipped into
such a pit of profanity. Would it not have been safer for all, following the counsel of wisdom,
to abstain from searching into such deep matters, and in peace and quietness to keep inviolate
the pure deposit of the faith? But since, in fact, human nothingness has commenced
intruding recklessly into matters that are above comprehension, and supporting by dogmatic
teaching the figments of their vain imagination, there has sprung up in consequence a whole
host of enemies to the truth, and among them these very men who are the subject of this
treatise; dogmatizers of deceit who seek to limit the Divine Being, and all but openly idolize
their own imagination, in that they deify the idea expressed by this “ungeneracy” of theirs,
as not being only in a certain relation discernible in the Divine nature, but as being itself
God, or the essence of God. Yet perchance they would have done better to look to the sacred

ministers of the word, that they might give honour due to the claims on their belief of the
things attested by the Holy Spirit Himself, and abide within the limits of their teaching and
knowledge, and not venture on themes which are not comprehended in the canon of the
sacred writers. For those writers, by revealing God, so long unknown to human life by
reason of the prevalence of idolatry, and making Him known to men, both from the wonders
which manifest themselves in His works, and from the names which express the manifold
variety of His power, lead men, as by the hand, to the understanding of the Divine nature,
making known to them the bare grandeur of the thought of God; while the question of His
essence, as one which it is impossible to grasp, and which bears no fruit to the curious enquirer,
they dismiss without any attempt at its solution. For whereas they have set forth respecting
all other things, that they were created, the heaven, the earth, the sea, times, ages,
and the creatures that are therein, but what each is in itself, and how and whence, on these
points they are silent; so, too, concerning God Himself, they exhort men to “believe that He
is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him1090,” but in regard to His
nature, as being above every name, they neither name it nor concern themselves about it.
For if we have learned any names expressive of the knowledge of God, all these are related
and have analogy to such names as denote human characteristics. For as they who would
indicate some person unknown by marks of recognition speak of him as of good parentage
and descent, if such happen to be the case, or as distinguished for his riches or his worth,
or as in the prime of life, or of such or such stature, and in so speaking they do not set forth
the nature of the person indicated, but give certain notes of recognition (for neither advantages
of birth, nor of wealth, nor of reputation, nor of age, constitute the man; they are considered,
simply as being observable in the man), thus too the expressions of Holy Scripture
devised for the glory of God set forth one or another of the things which are declared concerning
Him, each inculcating some special teaching. For by these expressions we are taught
either His power, or that He admits not of deterioration, or that He is without cause and
without limit, or that He is supreme above all things, or, in short, something, be it what it
may, respecting Him. But His very essence, as not to be conceived by the human intellect
or expressed in words, this it has left untouched as a thing not to be made the subject of
curious enquiry, ruling that it be revered in silence, in that it forbids the investigation of
things too deep for us, while it enjoins the duty of being slow to utter any word before God.
And therefore, whosoever searches the whole of Revelation will find therein no doctrine of
the Divine nature, nor indeed of anything else that has a substantial existence, so that we
pass our lives in ignorance of much, being ignorant first of all of ourselves, as men, and then
of all things besides. For who is there who has arrived at a comprehension of his own soul?
Who is acquainted with its very essence, whether it is material or immaterial, whether it is
<note type="footnote">1090 Heb. xi. 6.</note>

<pb n="497"/>
purely incorporeal, or whether it exhibits anything of a corporeal character; how it comes
into being, how it is composed, whence it enters into the body, how it departs from it, or
what means it possesses to unite it to the nature of the body; how, being intangible and
without form, it is kept within its own sphere, what difference exists among its powers, how
one and the same soul, in its eager curiosity to know the things which are unseen, soars
above the highest heavens, and again, dragged down by the weight of the body, falls back
on material passions, anger and fear, pain and pleasure, pity and cruelty, hope and memory,
cowardice and audacity, friendship and hatred, and all the contraries that are produced in
the faculties of the soul? Observing which things, who has not fancied that he has a sort of
populace of souls crowded together in himself, each of the aforesaid passions differing widely
from the rest, and, where it prevails, holding lordship over them all, so that even the rational
faculty falls under and is subject to the predominating power of such forces, and contributes
its own co-operation to such impulses, as to a despotic lord? What word, then, of the inspired
Scripture has taught us the manifold and multiform character of what we understand in
speaking of the soul? Is it a unity composed of them all, and, if so, what is it that blends and
harmonizes things mutually opposed, so that many things become one, while each element,
taken by itself, is shut up in the soul as in some ample vessel? And how is it that we have
not the perception of them all as being involved in it, being at one and the same time confident
and afraid, at once hating and loving and feeling in ourselves the working as well of
all other emotions confused and intermingled; but, on the contrary, take knowledge only
of their alternate control, when one of them prevails, the rest remaining quiescent? What
in short is this composition and arrangement, and this capacious void within us, such that
to each is assigned its own post, as though hindered by middle walls of partition from
holding intercourse with its neighbour? And then again what account has explained
whether passion is the fundamental essence of the soul, or fear, or any of the other elements
which I have mentioned; and what emotions are unsubstantial? For if these have an independent
subsistence, then, as I have said, there is comprehended in ourselves not one soul,
but a collection of souls, each of them occupying its distinct position as a particular and
individual soul. But if we must suppose these to be a kind of emotion without subsistence,
how can that which has no essential existence exercise lordship over us, having reduced us
as it were to slave under whichsoever of these things may have happened to prevail? And if
the soul is something that thought only can grasp, how can that which is manifold and
composite be contemplated as such, when such an object ought to be contemplated by itself,
independently of these bodily qualities? Then, as to the soul’s power of growth, of desire,
of nutrition, of change, and the fact that all the bodily powers are nourished, while feeling
does not extend through all, but, as in things without life, some of our members are destitute
of feeling, the bones for example, the cartilages, the nails, the hair, all of which take nourishment,
but do not feel,—tell me who is there that understands this only half-complete oper-

<pb n="498"/>
ation of the soul as to these? And why do I speak of the soul? Even the inquiry as to that
thing in the flesh itself which assumes all the corporeal qualities has not been pursued to
any definite result. For if any one has made a mental analysis of that which is seen into its
component parts, and, having stripped the object of its qualities, has attempted to consider
it by itself, I fail to see what will have been left for investigation. For when you take from a
body its colour, its shape, its degree of resistance, its weight, its quantity, its position, its
forces active or passive, its relation to other objects, what remains, that can still be called a
body, we can neither see of ourselves, nor are we taught it by Scripture. But how can he who
is ignorant of himself take knowledge of anything that is above himself? And if a man is familiarized
with such ignorance of himself, is he not plainly taught by the very fact not to be
astonished at any of the mysteries that are without? Wherefore also, of the elements of the
world, we know only so much by our senses as to enable us to receive what they severally
supply for our living. But we possess no knowledge of their substance, nor do we count it
loss to be ignorant of it. For what does it profit me to inquire curiously into the nature of
fire, how it is struck out, how it is kindled, how, when it has caught hold of the fuel supplied
to it, it does not let it go till it has devoured and consumed its prey; how the spark is latent
in the flint, how steel, cold as it is to the touch, generates fire, how sticks rubbed together
kindle flame, how water shining in the sun causes a flash; and then again the cause of its
upward tendency, its power of incessant motion?—Putting aside all which curious questions
and investigations, we give heed only to the subservience of this fire to life, seeing that he
who avails himself of its service fares no worse than he who busies himself with inquiries
into its nature.</p>
<p>Wherefore Holy Scripture omits all idle inquiry into substance as superfluous and unnecessary.
And methinks it was for this that John, the Son of Thunder, who with the loud
voice of the doctrines contained in his Gospel rose above that of the preaching which heralded
them, said at the close of his Gospel, “There are also many other things which Jesus did, the
which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not
contain the books that should be written1091.” He certainly does not mean by these the
miracles of healing, for of these the narrative leaves none unrecorded, even though it does
not mention the names of all who were healed. For when he tells us that the dead were raised,
that the blind received their sight, that the deaf heard, that the lame walked, and that He
healed all manner of sickness and all manner of disease, he does not in this leave any miracle
unrecorded, but embraces each and all in these general terms. But it may be that the Evangelist
means this in his profound wisdom: that we are to learn the majesty of the Son of God
not by the miracles alone which He did in the flesh. For these are little compared with the
greatness of His other work. “But look thou up to Heaven! Behold its glories! Transfer your
<note type="footnote">1091 S. John xxi. 25</note>

<pb n="499"/>
thought to the wide compass of the earth, and the watery depths! Embrace with your mind
the whole world, and when you have come to the knowledge of supramundane nature, learn
that these are the true works of Him Who sojourned for thee in the flesh,” which (saith he),
“if each were written”—and the essence, manner, origin, and extent of each given—the
world itself could not contain the fulness of Christ’s teaching about the world itself. For
since God hath made all things in wisdom, and to His wisdom there is no limit (for “His
understanding,” saith the Scripture, “is infinite”1092), the world, that is bounded by limits
of its own, cannot contain within itself the account of infinite wisdom. If, then, the whole
world is too little to contain the teaching of the works of God, how many worlds could
contain an account of the Lord of them all? For perhaps it will not be denied even by the
tongue of the blasphemer that the Maker of all things, which have been created by the mere
fiat of His will, is infinitely greater than all. If, then, the whole creation cannot contain what
might be said respecting itself (for so, according to our explanation, the great Evangelist
testifies), how should human shallowness contain all that might be said of the Lord of Creation?
Let those grand talkers inform us what man is, in comparison with the universe, what
geometrical point is so without magnitude, which of the atoms of Epicurus is capable of
such infinitesimal reduction in the vain fancy of those who make such problems the object
of their study, which of them falls so little short of non-existence, as human shallowness,
when compared with the universe. As saith also great David, with a true insight into human
weakness, “Mine age is as nothing unto Thee1093,” not saying that it is absolutely nothing,
but signifying, by this comparison to the non-existent, that what is so exceedingly brief is
next to nothing at all.</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, with only such a nature for their base of operations, they open their
mouths wide against the unspeakable Power, and encompass by one appellation the infinite
nature, confining the Divine essence within the narrow limits of the term ungeneracy, that
they may thereby pave a way for their blasphemy against the Only-begotten; but although
the great Basil had corrected this false opinion, and pointed out, in regard to the terms, that
they have no existence in nature, but are attached as conceptions to the things signified, so
far are they from returning to the truth, that they stick to what they have once advanced, as
to birdlime, and will not loose their hold of their fallacious mode of argument, nor do they
allow the term “ungeneracy” to be used in the way of a mental conception, but make it
represent the Divine nature itself. Now to go through their whole argument, and to attempt
to overthrow it by discussing word by word their frivolous and long-winded nonsense,
would be a task requiring much leisure, and time, and freedom from calls of business. Just
as I hear that Eunomius, after applying himself at his leisure, and laboriously, for a number

of years exceeding those of the Trojan war, has fabricated this dream for himself in his deep
slumbers, studiously seeking, not how to interpret any of the ideas which he has arrived at,
but how to drag and force them into keeping with his phrases, and going round and collecting
out of certain books the words in them that sound grandest. And as beggars in lack of
clothing pin and tack together tunics for themselves out of rags, so he, cropping here a
phrase and there a phrase, has woven together for himself the patchwork of his treatise,
glueing in and fixing together the joinings of his diction with much labour and pains, displaying
therein a petty and juvenile ambition for combat, which any man who has an eye
to actuality would disdain, just as a steadfast wrestler, no longer in the prime of life, would
disdain to play the woman by over-niceness in dress. But to me it seems that, when the scope
of the whole question has been briefly run through, his roundabout flourishes may well be
let alone.</p>
<p>I have said, then (for I make my master’s words my own), that reason supplies us with
but a dim and imperfect comprehension of the Divine nature; nevertheless, the knowledge
that we gather from the terms which piety allows us to apply to it is sufficient for our limited
capacity. Now we do not say that all these terms have a uniform significance; for some of
them express qualities inherent in God, and others qualities that are not, as when we say
that He is just or incorruptible, by the term “just” signifying that justice is found in Him,
and by “incorruptible” that corruption is not. Again, by a change of meaning, we may apply
terms to God in the way of accommodation, so that what is proper to God may be represented
by a term which in no wise belongs to Him, and what is foreign to His nature may be represented
by what belongs to Him. For whereas justice is the contradictory of injustice, and
everlastingness the contrary of destruction, we may fitly and without impropriety employ
contraries in speaking of God, as when we say that He is ever existent, or that He is not
unjust, which is equivalent to saying that He is just, and that He admits not of corruption.
So, too, we may say that other names of God, by a certain change of signification, may be
suitably employed to express either meaning, for example “good,” and “immortal,” and all
expressions of like formation; for each of these terms, according as it is taken, is capable of
indicating what does or what does not appertain to the Divine nature, so that, notwithstanding
the formal change, our orthodox opinion in regard to the object remains immovably
fixed. For it amounts to the same, whether we speak of God as unsusceptible of evil, or
whether we call Him good; whether we confess that He is immortal, or say that He ever
liveth. For we understand no difference in the sense of these terms, but we signify one and
the same thing by both, though the one may seem to convey the notion of affirmation, and
the other of negation. And so again, when we speak of God as the First Cause of all things,
or again, when we speak of Him as without cause, we are guilty of no contradiction in sense,
declaring as we do by either name that God is the prime Ruler and First Cause of all. Accordingly
when we speak of Him as without cause, and as Lord of all, in the former case we sig-

<pb n="501"/>
nify what does not attach to Him, in the latter case what does; it being possible, as I have
said, by a change of the things signified, to give an opposite sense to the words that express
them, and to signify a property by a word which for the time takes a negative form, and vice
versa. For it is allowable, instead of saying that He Himself has no primal cause, to describe
Him as the First Cause of all, and again, instead of this, to hold that He alone exists ungenerately,
so that while the words seem by the formal change to be at variance with each other,
the sense remains one and the same. For the object to be aimed at, in questions respecting
God, is not to produce a dulcet and melodious harmony of words, but to work out an orthodox
formula of thought, whereby a worthy conception of God may be ensured. Since, then,
it is only orthodox to infer that He Who is the First Cause of all is Himself without cause,
if this opinion is established, what further contention of words remains for men of sense
and judgment, when every word whereby such a notion is conveyed to us has the same signification?
For whether you say that He is the First Cause and Principle of all, or speak of
Him as without origin, whether you speak of Him as of ungenerate or eternal subsistence,
as the Cause of all or as alone without cause, all these words are, in a manner, of like force,
and equivalent to one another, as far as the meaning of the things signified is concerned;
and it is mere folly to contend for this or that vocal intonation, as if orthodoxy were a thing
of sounds and syllables rather than of the mind. This view, then, has been carefully enunciated
by our great master, whereby all whose eyes are not blindfolded by the veil of heresy may
clearly see that, whatever be the nature of God, He is not to be apprehended by sense, and
that He transcends reason, though human thought, busying itself with curious inquiry, with
such help of reason as it can command, stretches out its hand and just touches His unapproachable
and sublime nature, being neither keen-sighted enough to see clearly what is
invisible, nor yet so far withheld from approach as to be unable to catch some faint glimpse
of what it seeks to know. For such knowledge it attains in part by the touch of reason, in
part from its very inability to discern it, finding that it is a sort of knowledge to know that
what is sought transcends knowledge (for it has learned what is contrary to the Divine
nature, as well as all that may fittingly be conjectured respecting it). Not that it has been
able to gain full knowledge of that nature itself about which it reasons, but from the knowledge
of those properties which are, or are not, inherent in it, this mind of man sees what
alone can be seen, that that which is far removed from all evil, and is understood in all good,
is altogether such as I should pronounce ineffable and incomprehensible by human reason.
But although our great master has thus cleared away all unworthy notions respecting
the Divine nature, and has urged and taught all that may be reverently and fittingly held
concerning it, viz. that the First Cause is neither a corruptible thing, nor one brought into
being by any birth, but that it is outside the range of every conception of the kind; and that
from the negation of what is not inherent, and the affirmation of what may be with reverence
conceived to be inherent therein, we may best apprehend what He is—nevertheless this

<pb n="502"/>
vehement adversary of the truth opposes these teachings, and hopes with the sounding word
“ungeneracy” to supply a clear definition of the essence of God.</p>
<p>And yet it is plain to every one who has given any attention to the uses of words, that
the word incorruption denotes by the privative particle that neither corruption nor birth
appertains to God: just as many other words of like formation denote the absence of what
is not inherent rather than the presence of what is; e.g. harmless, painless, guileless, undisturbed,
passionless, sleepless, undiseased1094, impossible, unblamable, and the like. For all
these terms are truly applicable to God, and furnish a sort of catalogue and muster of evil
qualities from which God is separate. Yet the terms employed give no positive account of
that to which they are applied. We learn from them what it is not; but what it is, the force
of the words does not indicate. For if some one, wishing to describe the nature of man, were
to say that it is not lifeless, not insentient, not winged, not four-footed, not amphibious, he
would not indicate what it is: he would simply declare what it is not, and he would be no
more making untrue statements respecting man than he would be positively defining his
subject. In the same way, from the many things which are predicated of the Divine nature,
we learn under what conditions we may conceive God as existing, but what He is essentially,
such statements do not inform us.</p>
<p>While, however, we strenuously avoid all concurrence with absurd notions in our
thoughts of God, we allow ourselves in the use of many diverse appellations in regard to
Him, adapting them to our point of view. For whereas no suitable word has been found to
express the Divine nature, we address God by many names, each by some distinctive touch
adding something fresh to our notions respecting Him,—thus seeking by variety of nomenclature
to gain some glimmerings for the comprehension of what we seek. For when we
question and examine ourselves as to what God is, we express our conclusions variously, as
that He is that which presides over the system and working of the things that are, that His
existence is without cause, while to all else He is the Cause of being; that He is that which
has no generation or beginning, no corruption, no turning backward, no diminution of
supremacy; that He is that in which evil finds no place, and from which no good is absent.</p>
<p>And if any one would distinguish such notions by words, he would find it absolutely
necessary to call that which admits of no changing to the worse unchanging and invariable,
and to call the First Cause of all ungenerate, and that which admits not of corruption incorruptible;
and that which ceases at no limit immortal and never failing; and that which presides

over all Almighty. And so, framing names for all other Divine attributes in accordance with
reverent conceptions of Him, we designate them now by one name, now by another, according
to our varying lines of thought, as power, or strength, or goodness, or ungeneracy, or
perpetuity.</p>
<p>I say, then, that men have a right to such word-building, adapting their appellations to
their subject, each man according to his judgment; and that there is no absurdity in this,
such as our controversialist makes a pretence of, shuddering at it as at some gruesome
hobgoblin, and that we are fully justified in allowing the use of such fresh applications of
words in respect to all things that can be named, and to God Himself.</p>
<p>For God is not an expression, neither hath He His essence in voice or utterance. But
God is of Himself what also He is believed to be, but He is named, by those who call upon
Him, not what He is essentially (for the nature of Him Who alone is is unspeakable), but
He receives His appellations from what are believed to be His operations in regard to our
life. To take an instance ready to our hand; when we speak of Him as God, we so call Him
from regarding Him as overlooking and surveying all things, and seeing through the things
that are hidden. But if His essence is prior to His works, and we understand His works by
our senses, and express them in words as we are best able, why should we be afraid of calling
things by words of later origin than themselves? For if we stay to interpret any of the attributes
of God till we understand them, and we understand them only by what His works teach us,
and if His power precedes its exercise, and depends on the will of God, while His will resides
in the spontaneity of the Divine nature, are we not clearly taught that the words which
represent things are of later origin than the things themselves, and that the words which are
framed to express the operations of things are reflections of the things themselves? And that
this is so, we are clearly taught by Holy Scripture, by the mouth of great David, when, as by
certain peculiar and appropriate names, derived from his contemplation of the works of
God, he thus speaks of the Divine nature: “The Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering,
and of great goodness1095.” Now what do these words tell us? Do they indicate
His operations, or His nature? No one will say that they indicate aught but His operations.
At what time, then, after showing mercy and pity, did God acquire His name from their
display? Was it before man’s life began? But who was there to be the object of pity? Was it,
then, after sin entered into the world? But sin entered after man. The exercise, therefore, of
pity, and the name itself, came after man. What then? will our adversary, wise as he is above
the Prophets, convict David of error in applying names to God derived from his opportunities
of knowing Him? or, in contending with him, will he use against him the pretence in
his stately passage as out of a tragedy, saying that “he glories in the most blessed life of God
with names drawn from human imagination, whereas it gloried in itself alone, long before
<note type="footnote">1095 Ps. ciii. 8.</note>

<pb n="504"/>
men were born to imagine them”? The Psalmist’s advocate will readily admit that the Divine
nature gloried in itself alone even before the existence of human imagination, but will contend
that the human mind can speak only so much in respect of God as its capacity, instructed
by His works, will allow. “For,” as saith the Wisdom of Solomon, “by the greatness and
beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker of them is seen1096.”</p>
<p>But in applying such appellations to the Divine essence, “which passeth all understanding,”
we do not seek to glory in it by the names we employ, but to guide our own selves by
the aid of such terms towards the comprehension of the things which are hidden. “I said
unto the Lord,” saith the Prophet, “Thou art my God, my goods are nothing unto Thee1097.”
How then are we glorifying the most blessed life of God, as this man affirms, when (as saith
the Prophet) “our goods are nothing unto Him”? Is it that he takes “call” to mean “glory
in”? Yet those who employ the latter word rightly, and who have been trained to use words
with propriety, tell us that the word “glory in” is never used of mere indication, but that that
idea is expressed by such words as “to make known,” “to show,” “to indicate,” or some
other of the kind, whereas the word for “glory in” means to be proud of, or delight in a thing,
and the like. But he affirms that by employing names drawn from human imagination we
“glory in” the blessed life. We hold, however, that to add any honour to the Divine nature,
which is above all honour, is more than human infirmity can do. At the same time we do
not deny that we endeavour, by words and names devised with due reverence, to give some
notion of its attributes. And so, following studiously in the path of due reverence, we apprehend
that the first cause is that which has its subsistence not from any cause superior to itself.
Which view, if so be one accepts it as true, is praiseworthy for its truth alone. But if one
should judge it to be superior to other aspects of the Divine nature, and so should say that
God, exulting and rejoicing in this alone, glories in it, as of paramount excellence, one would
find support only from the Muse by whom Eunomius is inspired, when he says, that “un-
generacy” glories in itself, that which, mark you, he calls God’s essence, and styles the blessed
and Divine life.</p>
<p>But let us hear how, “in the way most needed, and the form that preceded” (for with
such rhymes he again gives us a taste of the flowers of style), let us hear, I say, how by such
means he proposes to refute the opinion formed of him, and to keep in the dark the ignorance
of those whom he has deluded. For I will use our dithyrambist’s own verbal inflections and
phraseology. When, says he, we assert that words by which thought is expressed die as soon
as they are uttered, we add that whether words are uttered or not, whether they are yet in

<pb n="505"/>
existence or not, God was and is ungenerate. Let us learn, then, what connection there is
between the conception or the formation of words, and the things which we signify by this
or that mode of utterance. Accordingly, if God is ungenerate before the creation of man,
we must esteem as of no account the words which indicate that thought, inasmuch as they
are dispersed along with the sounds that express them, if such thought happen to be named
after human notion. For to be, and to be called, are not convertible terms. But God is by His
nature what He is, but He is called by us by such names as the poverty of our nature will
allow us to make use of, which is incapable of enunciating thought except by means of voice
and words. Accordingly, understanding Him to be without origin, we enunciate that thought
by the term ungenerate. And what harm is it to Him Who indeed is, that He should be
named by us as we conceive Him to be? For His ungenerate existence is not the result of
His being called ungenerate, but the name is the result of the existence. But this our acute
friend fails to see, nor does he take a clear view of his own positions. For if he did, he would
certainly have left off reviling those who framed the word ungeneracy to express the idea
in their minds. For look at what he says, “Words so spoken perish as soon as they are spoken;
but God both is and was ungenerate, both after the words were spoken and before. You see
that the Supreme Being is what He is, before the creation of all things, whether silent or not,
being what He is neither in greater nor in less degree; while the use of words and names was
not devised till after the creation of man, endowed by God with the faculty of reason and
speech.”</p>
<p>If, then, the creation is of later date than its Creator, and man is the latest in the scale
of creation, and if speech is a distinctive characteristic of man, and verbs and nouns are the
component elements of speech, and ungeneracy is a noun, how is it that he does not understand
that he is combating his own arguments? For we, on our side, say that by human
thought and intelligence words have been devised expressive of things which they represent,
and he, on his side, allows that those who employ speech are demonstrably later in point of
time than the Divine life, and that the Divine nature is now, and ever has been, without
generation. If, then, he allows the blessed life to be anterior to man (for to that point I return),
and we do not deny man’s later creation, but contend that we have used forms of speech
ever since we came into being and received the faculty of reason from our Maker, and if
ungeneracy is a word expressive of a special idea, and every word is a part of human
speech,—it follows that he who admits that the Divine nature was anterior to man must at
the same time admit that the name invented by man to express that nature was itself later
in being. For it was not likely that the use of speech should be exercised before the existence
of creatures to use it, any more than that farming should be exercised before the existence
of farmers, or navigation before that of navigators, or in fact any of the occupations of life
before that of life itself. Why, then, does he contend with us, instead of following his premises
to their legitimate conclusion?</p>

<pb n="506"/>
<p>He says that God was what He is, before the creation of man. Nor do we deny it. For
whatsoever we conceive of God existed before the creation of the world. But we maintain
that it received its name after the namer came into being. For if we use words for this purpose,
that they may supply us with teaching about the things which they signify, and it is ignorance
alone that requires teaching, while the Divine Nature, as comprehending all knowledge, is
above all teaching, it follows that names were invented to denote the Supreme Being, not
for His sake, but for our own. For He did not attach the term ungeneracy to His nature in
order that He Himself might be instructed. For He Who knoweth all things has no need of
syllables and words to instruct Him as to His own nature and majesty.</p>
<p>But that we might gain some sort of comprehension of what with reverence may be
thought respecting Him, we have stamped our different ideas with certain words and syllables,
labelling, as it were, our mental processes with verbal formulæ to serve as characteristic
notes and indications, with the object of giving a clear and simple declaration of our mental
processes by means of words attached to, and expressive of, our ideas. Why, then, does he
find fault with our contention that the term ungeneracy was devised to indicate the existence
of God without origin or beginning, and that, independently of all exercise of speech, or silence,
or thought, and before the very idea of creation, God was and remains ungenerate?
If, indeed, any one should argue that God was not ungenerate till the name ungeneracy had
been found, the man might be pardonable for writing as he has written, in contravention
of such an absurdity. But if no one denies that He existed before speech and reason,
whereas, while the form of words by which the meaning is expressed is said by us to have
been devised by mental conception, the end and aim of his controversy with us is to show
that the name is not of man’s device, but that it existed before our creation, though by whom
it was spoken I do not know1098, what has the assertion that God existed ungenerately before
all things, and the contention that1099 mental conception is posterior to God, got to do with
this aim of his? For that God is not a conception has been fully demonstrated, so that we
may press him with the same sort of argument, and reply, so to say, in his own words, e.g.
“It is utter folly to regard understanding as of earlier birth than those who exercise it”; or
again, as he proceeds a little below, “Nor as though we intended this, i.e. to make men, the
latest of God’s works of creation, anterior to the conceptions of their own understanding.”
Great indeed would be the force of the argument, if any one of us, out of sheer folly and
madness, should argue that God was a conception of the mind. But if this is not so, nor ever

has been, (for who would go to such a pitch of folly as to assert that He Who alone is, and
Who brought all else whatsoever into being, has no substantial existence of His own, and
to make Him out to be a mere conception of a name?) why does he fight with shadows,
contending with imaginary propositions? Is not the cause of this unreasonable litigiousness
clear, that, feeling ashamed of the fallacy respecting ungeneracy with which his dupes have
been deluded (since it has been proved that the word is very far removed from the Divine
essence), he is deliberately shuffling up his arguments, shifting the controversy from words
to things, so that by throwing all into confusion the unwary may more easily be seduced,
by imagining that God has been described by us either as a conception, or as posterior in
existence to the invention of human terminology; and thus, leaving our argument unrefuted,
he is shifting his position to another quarter of the field? For our conclusion was, as I have
said, that the term ungeneracy does not indicate the Divine nature, but is applicable to it as
the result of a conception by which the fact that God subsists without prior cause is pointed
at. But what they were for establishing was this: that the word was indicative of the Divine
essence itself. Yet how has it been established that the word has this force? I suppose the
handling of this question is in reserve in some other of his writings. But here he makes it
his main object to show that God exists ungenerately, just as though some one were simply
questioning him on such points as these—what view he held as to the term ungenerate,
whether he thought it invented to show that the First Cause was without beginning and
origin, or as declaring the Divine essence itself; and he, with much assumption of gravity
and wisdom, were replying that he, for his part, had no doubt that God was the Maker of
heaven and earth. How widely this method of proceeding differs from, and is unconnected
with, his first contention, you may see, in the same way as you may see how little his fine
description of his controversy with us is connected with the question at issue. For let us look
at the matter in this wise.</p>
<p>They say that God is ungenerate, and in this we agree. But that ungeneracy itself constitutes
the Divine essence, here we take exception. For we maintain that this term is declarative
of God’s ungenerate subsistence, but not that ungeneracy is God. But of what nature is his
refutation? It is this: that before man’s creation God existed ungenerately. But what has this
to do with the point which he promises to establish, that the term and its Subject are
identical? For he lays it down that ungeneracy is the Divine essence. But what sort of a fulfilment
of his promise is it, to show that God existed before beings capable of speech? What
a wonderful, what an irresistible demonstration! what perfection of logical refinement! Who
that has not been initiated in the mysteries of the awful craft may venture to look it in the
face? Yet in particularizing the meanings of the term “conception,” he makes a solemn
travesty of it. For, saith he, of words used to express a conception of the mind, some exist
only in pronunciation, as for instance those which signify nonentity, while others have their
peculiar meaning; and of these some have an amplifying force, as in the case of things colossal,

<pb n="508"/>
others a diminishing, as in that of pigmies, others a multiplying, as in that of many-headed
monsters, others a combinative, as in that of centaurs. After thus reducing the force of the
term “conception” to its lowest value, our clever friend will allow it, you see, no further ex-
tension. He says that it is without sense and meaning, that it fancies the unnatural, either
contracting or extending the limits of nature, or putting heterogeneous notions together,
or juggling with strange and monstrous combinations.</p>
<p>With such gibes at the term “conception,” he shows, to the best of his ability, that it is
useless and unprofitable for the life of man. What, then, was the origin of our higher branches
of learning, of geometry, arithmetic, the logical and physical sciences, of the inventions of
mechanical art, of the marvels of measuring time by the brazen dial and the water-clock?
What, again, of ontology, of the science of ideas, in short of all intellectual speculation as
applied to great and sublime objects? What of agriculture, of navigation, and of the other
pursuits of human life? how comes the sea to be a highway for man? how are things of the
air brought into the service of things of the earth, wild things tamed, objects of terror brought
into subjection, animals stronger than ourselves made obedient to the rein? Have not all
these benefits to human life been achieved by conception? For, according to my account of
it, conception is the method by which we discover things that are unknown, going on to
further discoveries by means of what adjoins to and follows1100 from our first perception
with regard to the thing studied. For when we have formed some idea of what we seek to
know, by adapting what follows to the first result of our discoveries we gradually conduct
our inquiry to the end of our proposed research.</p>
<p>But why enumerate the greater and more splendid results of this faculty? For every one
who is not unfriendly to truth can see for himself that all else that Time has discovered for
the service and benefit of human life, has been discovered by no other instrumentality than
that of conception. And it seems to me, that any one who should judge this faculty more
precious than any other with the exercise of which we are gifted in this life by Divine
Providence would not be far mistaken in his judgment. And in saying this I am supported
by Job’s teaching, where he represents God as answering His servant by the tempest and
the clouds, saying both other things meet for Him to say, and that it is He Who hath set
man over the arts, and given to woman her skill in weaving and embroidery1101.</p>
<p>Now that He did not teach us such things by some visible operation, Himself presiding
over the work, as we may see in matters of bodily teaching, no one would gainsay whose
nature is not altogether animal and brutish. But still it has been said that our first knowledge
of such arts is from Him, and, if such is the case, surely He Who endowed our nature with
<note type="footnote">1100 The definition of ἐπίνοια, i.e. ἔφοδος εὑρετικὴ τῶν ἀγνοουμένων, διὰ τῶν προσεχῶν τε καὶ

<pb n="509"/>
such a faculty of conceiving and finding out the objects of our investigation was Himself
our Guide to the arts. And by the law of causation, whatever is discovered and established
by conception must be ascribed to Him Who is the Author of that faculty. Thus human life
invented the Art of Healing, but nevertheless he would be right who should assert that Art
to be a gift from God. And whatever discovery has been made in human life, conducive to
any useful purposes of peace or war, came to us from no other quarter but from an intelligence
conceiving and discovering according to our several requirements; and that intelligence
is a gift of God. It is to God, then, that we owe all that intelligence supplies to us. Nor do I
deny the objection made by our adversaries, that lying wonders also are fabricated by this
faculty. For their contention as to this makes for our own side in the argument. For we too
assert that the science of opposites is the same, whether beneficial or the reverse; e.g. in the
case of the arts of healing and navigation, and so on. For he who knows how to relieve the
sick by drugs will also know, if indeed he were to turn his art to an evil purpose, how to mix
some deleterious ingredient in the food of the healthy. And he who can steer a boat with its
rudder into port can also steer it for the reef or the rock, if minded to destroy those on board.
And the painter, with the same art by which he depicts the fairest form on his canvas, could
give us an exact representation of the ugliest. So, too, the wrestling-master, by the experience
which he has gained in anointing, can set a dislocated limb, or, should he wish to do so,
dislocate a sound one. But why encumber our argument by multiplying instances? As in
the above-mentioned cases no one would deny that he who has learned to practise an art
for right purposes can also abuse it for wrong ones, so we say that the faculty of thought
and conception was implanted by God in human nature for good, but, with those who abuse
it as an instrument of discovery, it frequently becomes the handmaid of pernicious inventions.
But although it is thus possible for this faculty to give a plausible shape to what is false and
unreal, it is none the less competent to investigate what actually and in very truth subsists,
and its ability for the one must in fairness be regarded as an evidence of its ability for the
other.</p>
<p>For that one who proposes to himself to terrify or charm an audience should have plenty
of conception to effect such a purpose, and should display to the spectators many-handed,
many-headed, or fire-breathing monsters, or men enfolded in the coils of serpents, or that
he should seem to increase their stature, or enlarge their natural proportions to a ridiculous
extent, or that he should describe men metamorphosed into fountains and trees and birds,
a kind of narrative which is not without its attraction for such as take pleasure in things of
that sort;—all this, I say, is the clearest of demonstrations that it is possible to arrive at
higher knowledge also by means of this inventive faculty.</p>
<p>For it is not the case that, while the intelligence implanted in us by the Giver is fully
competent to conjure up non-realities, it is endowed with no faculty at all for providing us
with things that may profit us. But as the impulsive and elective faculty of the soul is estab-

<pb n="510"/>
lished in our nature, to incite us to what is good and noble, though a man may also abuse
it for what is evil, and no one can call the fact that the elective faculty sometimes inclines to
evil a proof that it never inclines to what is good—so the bias of conception towards what
is vain and unprofitable does not prove its inability for what is profitable, but, on the contrary,
is a demonstration of its not being unserviceable for what is beneficial and necessary to the
mind. For as, in the one case, it discovers means to produce pleasure or terror, so, in the
other, it does not fail to find ways for getting at truth. Now one of the objects of inquiry was
whether the First Cause, viz. God, exists without beginning, or whether His existence is dependent
on some beginning. But perceiving, by the aid of thought, that that cannot be a
First Cause which we conceive of as the consequence of another, we devised a word expressive
of such a notion, and we say that He who is without anterior cause exists without origin,
or, so to say, ungenerately. And Him Who so exists we call ungenerate and without origin,
indicating, by that appellation, not what He is, but what He is not.</p>
<p>But as far as possible to elucidate the idea, I will endeavour to illustrate it by a still
plainer example. Let us suppose the inquiry to be about some tree, whether it is cultivated
or wild. If the former, we call it planted, if the latter, not planted. And such a term exactly
hits the truth, for the tree must needs be after this manner or that. And yet the word does
not indicate the peculiar nature of the plant. From the term “not-planted” we learn that it
is of spontaneous growth; but whether what is thus signified is a plane, or a vine, or some
other such plant, the name applied to it does not inform us.</p>
<p>This example being understood, it is time to go on to the thing which it illustrates. This
much we comprehend, that the First Cause has His existence from no antecedent one. Accordingly,
we call God ungenerate as existing ungenerately, reducing this notion of ungeneracy
into verbal form. That He is without origin or beginning we show by the force of the
term. But what that Being is which exists ungenerately, this appellation does not lead us to
discern. Nor was it to be supposed that the processes of conception could avail to raise us
above the limits of our nature, and open up the incomprehensible to our view, and enable
us to compass the knowledge of that which no knowledge can approach1102. Nevertheless,
our adversary storms at our Master, and tries to tear to pieces his teaching respecting the
<note type="footnote">1102 Cf. Origen c. Celsum, vi. 65. Celsus had said, “God cannot be named.” “This requires a distinction to
be made. If Celsus means that there is nothing in the signification of words that can express the qualities of God,
what he says is true, seeing that there are many other qualities that cannot be named. Who, for instance, can
express in words the difference of quality between the sweetness of a date and that of a fig? Peculiar individual
qualities cannot be expressed in a word. No wonder, then, that in this absolute sense God cannot be named. But
if by ‘name’ we only mean the possible expression of some one thing about God, by way of leading on the
listener, and producing in him such a notion about God as human faculties can reach to, then there is nothing
strange in saying, that God can have a name.”</note>

<pb n="511"/>
faculty of thought and conception, and derides what has been said, revelling as usual in the
rattle of his jingling phraseology, and saying that he (Basil) shrinks from adducing evidence
respecting those things of which he presumes to be the interpreter. For, quoting certain of
the Master’s speculations on the faculty of conception, in which he shows that its exercise
finds place, not only in reference to vain and trivial objects, but that it is competent to deal
also with weightier matters, he, by means of his speculation about the corn, and seed, and
other food (in Genesis), brings Basil into court with the charge, that his language is a follow-
ing of pagan philosophy1103, and that he is circumscribing Divine Providence, as not allowing
that words were given to things by God, and that he is fighting in the ranks of the Atheists,
and taking arms against Providence, and that he admires the doctrines of the profane rather
than the laws of God, and ascribes to them the palm of wisdom, not having observed in the
earliest of the sacred records, that before the creation of man, the naming of fruit and seed
are mentioned in Holy Writ.</p>
<note type="footnote">1103 τῃ ἔξωθεν φιλοσοφίU+0026 139·. Eunomius, in this accusation, must have been thinking, in the θέσει and
φύσει controversy on the origin of language, of Democritus, who called words “statues in sound,” i.e. ascribed
to them a certain amount of artificiality. But it is doubtful whether the opinion of the purely human origin of
language can be ascribed to him, when we consider another expression of his, that “words were statues in sound,
but statues not made by the hands of men, but by the gods themselves.” Language with him was conventional,
but it was not arbitrary. Again, Plato defines a word, an imitation in sound of that which it imitates (Cratylus,
423 B), and Aristotle calls words imitations (Rhet. iii. 1). But both of them were very far indeed from tracing
language back to mere onamatopoeia, i.e. ascribing it to θέσις (agreement), as opposed to φύσις in the sense of
the earlier Greek philosophy, the “essence” of the thing named, rather than the “nature” of the names. Long
before them Pythagoras had said, “the wisest of all things is Number, and next to Number, that which gives
names.” These oracular words do not countenance the idea that the origin of language was purely human. Perhaps
Epicurus more definitely than any taught that in the first formation of language men acted unconsciously, moved
by nature (in the modern sense), and that then as a second stage there was an agreement or understanding to
use a certain sound for a certain conception. Against this Heraclitus (b.c. 503) had taught that words exist φύσει.
“Words are like the shadows of things, like the pictures of trees and mountains reflected in the river, like our
own images when we look into a mirror.” We know at all events here what he did not mean, viz., that man imposed
what names he pleased on the objects round him. Heraclitus’ “nature” is a very different thing from the Darwinian
Nature; it is the inherent fitness between the object and name. Eunomius, then, was hardly justified in calling
the Greek philosophy, as a whole, atheistical in this matter, and “against Providence.” This φύσις, the impalpable
force in the things named, could still be represented as the will of the Deity. Eunomius outdoes Origen even, or
any Christian writer, in contending for the sacredness of names. He makes the Deity the name-giver, but with
the sole object of deifying his “Ungenerate.” Perhaps Basil’s teaching of the human faculty of ᾽Επίνοια working
under God as the name-giver is the truest statement of all, and harmonizes most with modern thought.</note>

<pb n="512"/>
<p>Such are his charges against us; not indeed his notions as expressed in his own phraseology,
for we have made such alterations as were required to correct the ruggedness and
harshness of his style. What, then, is our answer to this careful guardian of Divine Providence?
He asserts that we are in error, because, while we do not deny man’s having been created a
rational being by God, we ascribe the invention of words to the logical faculty implanted
by God in man’s nature. And this is the bitterest of his accusations, whereby our teacher of
righteousness is charged with deserting to the tenets of the Atheists, and is denounced as
partaking with and supporting their lawless company, and indeed as guilty of all the most
atrocious offences. Well, then, let this corrector of our blunders tell us, did God give names
to the things which He created? For so says our new interpreter of the mysteries: “Before
the creation of man God named germ, and herb, and grass, and seed, and tree, and the like,
when by the word of His power He brought them severally into being.” If, then, he abides
by the bare letter, and so far Judaizes, and has yet to learn that the Christian is a disciple not
of the letter but of the Spirit (for the letter killeth, says the Apostle, but the Spirit giveth
life1104), and quotes to us the bare literal reading of the words as though God Himself pronounced
them—if, I say, he believes this, that, after the similitude of men, God made use
of fluency of speech, expressing His thoughts by voice and accent—if, I repeat, he believes
this, he cannot reasonably deny what follows as its logical consequence. For our speech is
uttered by the organs of speech, the windpipe, the tongue, the teeth, and the mouth, the inhalation
of air from without and the breath from within working together to produce the
utterance. For the windpipe, fitting into the throat like a flute, emits a sound from below;
and the roof of the mouth, by reason of the void space above extending to the nostrils, like
some musical instrument, gives volume from above to the voice. And the cheeks, too, are
aids to speech, contracting and expanding in accordance with their structural arrangement,
or propelling the voice through a narrow passage by various movements of the tongue,
which it effects now with one part of itself now with another, giving hardness or softness to
the sound which passes over it by contact with the teeth or with the palate. Again, the service
of the lips contributes not a little to the result, affecting the voice by the variety of their distinctive
movements, and helping to shape the words as they are uttered.</p>
<p>If, then, God gives things their names as our new expositor of the Divine record assures
us, naming germ, and grass, and tree, and fruit, He must of necessity have pronounced each
of these words not otherwise than as it is pronounced; i.e. according to the composition of
the syllables, some of which are sounded by the lips, others by the tongue, others by both.
But if none of these words could be uttered, except by the operation of vocal organs producing
each syllable and sound by some appropriate movement, he must of necessity ascribe the
possession of such organs to God, and fashion the Divine Being according to the exigencies
<note type="footnote">1104 2 Cor. iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="513"/>
of speech. For each adaptation of the vocal organs must be in some form or other, and form
is a bodily limitation. Further, we know very well that all bodies are composite, but where
you see composition you see also dissolution, and dissolution, as the notion implies, is the
same thing as destruction. This, then, is the upshot of our controversialist’s victory over us;
to show us the God of his imagining whom he has fashioned by the name ungeneracy—speaking,
indeed, that He may not lose His share in the invention of names, but provided with
vocal organs with which to utter them, and not without bodily nature to enable Him to
employ them (for you cannot conceive of formal utterance in the abstract apart from a
body), and gradually going on to the congenital affections of the body—through the composite
to dissolution, and so finding His end in destruction.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of this new-fangled Deity, as deducible from the words of our new
God-maker. But he takes his stand on the Scriptures, and maintains that Moses explicitly
declares this, when he says, “God said,” adding His words, “Let there be light,” and, “Let
there be a firmament,” and, “Let the waters be gathered together…and let the dry land appear,”
and, “Let the earth bring forth,” and, “Let the waters bring forth,” and, whatsoever
else is written in its order. Let us, then, examine the meaning of what is said. Who does not
know, even if he be the merest simpleton, that there is a natural correlation between hearing
and speech, and that, as it is impossible for hearing to discharge its function when no one
is speaking, so speech is ineffectual unless directed to hearing? If, then, he means literally
that “God said,” let him tell us also to what hearing His words were addressed. Does he
mean that He said them to Himself? If so, the commands which He issues, He issues to
Himself. Yet who will accept this interpretation, that God sits upon His throne prescribing
what He Himself must do, and employing Himself as His minister to do His bidding? But
even supposing one were to allow that it was not blasphemy to say this, who has any need
of words and speech for himself, even though a man? For every one’s own mental action
suffices him to produce choice and volition. But he will doubtless say that the Father held
converse with the Son. But what need of vocal utterance for that? For it is a property of
bodily nature to signify the thoughts of the heart by means of words, whence also written
characters equivalent to speech were invented for the expression of thought. For we declare
thought equally by speaking and by writing, but in the case of those who are not too far
distant we reach their hearing by voice, but declare our mind to those who are at a distance
by written characters; and in the case of those present with us, in proportion to their distance
from us, we raise or lower the tones of our voice, and to those close by us we sometimes
point out what they are to do simply by a nod; and such or such an expression of the eye is
sufficient to convey our determination, or a movement of the hand is sufficient to signify
our approval or disapproval of something going on. If, then, those who are encompassed
by the body are able to make known the hidden working of their minds to their neighbours,
even without voice, or speech, or correspondence by means of letters, and silence causes no

<pb n="514"/>
hindrance to the despatch of business, can it be that in the case of the immaterial, and intangible,
and, as Eunomius says, the Supreme and first Being, there is any need of words to indicate
the thought of the Father and to make known His will to the Only-Begotten
Son—words, which, as he himself says, are wont to perish as soon as they are uttered? No
one, methinks, who has common sense will accept this as the truth, especially as all sound
is poured forth into the air. For voice cannot be produced unless it takes consistence in air.
Now, even they themselves must suppose some medium of communication between the
speaker and him to whom he speaks. For if there were no such medium, how could the voice
travel from the speaker to the hearer? What, then, will they say is the medium or interval
by which they divide the Father from the Son? Between bodies, indeed, there is an interval
of atmospheric space, differing in its nature from the nature of human bodies. But God,
Who is intangible, and without form, and pure from all composition, in communicating
His counsels with the Only-Begotten Son, Who is similarly, or rather in the same manner,
immaterial and without body—if He made His communication by voice, what medium
would He have had through which the word, transmitted as in a current, might reach the
ears of the Only-Begotten? For we need hardly stop to consider that God is not separable
into apprehensive faculties, as we are, whose perceptions separately apprehend their corresponding
objects; e.g. sight apprehends what may be seen, hearing what may be heard, so
that touch does not taste, and hearing has no perception of odours and flavours, but each
confines itself to that function to which it was appointed by nature, holding itself insensible,
as it were, to those with which it has no natural correspondence, and incapable of tasting
the pleasure enjoyed by its neighbour sense. But with God it is otherwise. All in all, He is at
once sight, and hearing, and knowledge; and there we stop, for it is not permitted us to
ascribe the more animal perceptions to that refined nature. Still we take a very low view of
God, and drag down the Divine to our own grovelling standard, if we suppose the Father
speaking with His mouth, and the Son’s ear listening to His words. What, then, are we to
suppose is the medium which conveys the Father’s voice to the hearing of the Son? It must
be created or uncreate. But we may not call it created; for the Word was before the creation
of the world: and beside the Divine nature there is nothing uncreate. If, therefore, there was
no creation then, and the Word spoken of in the cosmogony was older than creation, will
he, who maintains that speech and a voice are meant by “the Word,” suggest what medium
existed between the Father and the Son, whereby those words and sounds were expressed?
For if a medium exist, it must needs exist in a nature of its own, so as to differ in nature both
from the Father and the Son. Being, then, something of necessity different, it divides the
Father and the Son from each other, as though inserted between the two. What, then, could
it be? Not created, for creation is younger than the Word. Generated we have learnt the
Only-begotten (and Him alone) to be. Except the Father, none is ungenerate. Truth, therefore,
obliges us to the conclusion that there is no medium between the Father and the Son. But

where separation is not conceived of the closest connection is naturally implied. And what
is so connected needs no medium for voice or speech. Now, by “connected,” I mean here
what is in all respects inseparable. For in the case of a spiritual nature the term connection
does not mean corporeal connection, but the union and blending of spiritual with spiritual
through identity of will. Accordingly, there is no divergence of will between the Father and
the Son, but the image of goodness is after the Archetype of all goodness and beauty, and
as, if a man should look at himself in a glass (for it is perfectly allowable to explain the idea
by corporeal illustrations), the copy will in all respects be conformed to the original, the
shape of the man who is reflected being the cause of the shape on the glass, and the reflection
making no spontaneous movement or inclination unless commenced by the original, but,
if it move, moving along with it,—in like manner we maintain that our Lord, the Image of
the invisible God, is immediately and inseparably one with the Father in every movement
of His Will. If the Father will anything, the Son Who is in the Father knows the Father’s
will, or rather He is Himself the Father’s will. For, if He has in Himself all that is the Father’s,
there is nothing of the Father’s that He cannot have. If, then, He has all things that are the
Father’s in Himself, or, say we rather, if He has the Father Himself, then, along with the
Father and the things that are the Father’s, He must needs have in Himself the whole of the
Father’s will. He needs not, therefore, to know the Father’s will by word, being Himself the
Word of the Father, in the highest acceptation of the term. What, then, is the word that can
be addressed to Him who is the Word indeed? And how can He Who is the Word indeed
require a second word for instruction?</p>
<p>But it may be said that the voice of the Father was addressed to the Holy Spirit. But
neither does the Holy Spirit require instruction by speech, for being God, as saith the Apostle,
He “searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God1105.” If, then, God utters any word, and
all speech is directed to the ear, let those who maintain that God expresses Himself in the
language of continuous discourse, inform us what audience He addressed. Himself He needs
not address. The Son has no need of instruction by words. The Holy Ghost searcheth even
the deep things of God. Creation did not yet exist. To whom, then, was God’s word addressed?</p>
<p>But, says he, the record of Moses does not lie, and from it we learn that God spake. No!
nor is great David of the number of those who lie, and he expressly says; “The heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech,
and night unto night showeth knowledge;” and after saying that the heavens and the firmament
declare, and that day and that night showeth knowledge and speech, he adds to what
he has said, that “there is neither speech nor language, and that their voices are not
heard1106.” Yet how can such declaring and showing forth be other than words, and how
<note type="footnote">1105 1 Cor. ii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">1106 Ps. xix. 1–3 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="516"/>
is it that no voice addresses itself to the ear? Is the prophet contradicting himself, or is he
stating an impossibility, when he speaks of words without sound, and declaration without
language, and announcement without voice? or, is there not rather the very perfection of
truth in his teaching, which tells us, in the words which I have quoted, that the declaration
of the heavens, and the word shouted forth by the day, is no articulate voice nor language
of the lips, but is a revelation of the power of God to those who are capable of hearing it,
even though no voice be heard?</p>
<p>What, then, do we think of this passage? For it may be that, if we understand it, we shall
also understand the meaning of Moses. It often happens that Holy Scripture, to enable us
more clearly to comprehend a matter to be revealed, makes use of a bodily illustration, as
would seem to be the case in this passage from David, who teaches us by what he says that
none of the things which are have their being from chance or accident, as some have imagined
that our world and all that is therein was framed by fortuitous and undesigned combinations
of first elements, and that no Providence penetrated the world. But we are taught that there
is a cause of the system and government of the Universe, on Whom all nature depends, to
Whom it owes its origin and cause, towards Whom it inclines and moves, and in Whom it
abides. And since, as saith the Apostle, His eternal power and godhead are understood, being
clearly seen through the creation of the world1107, therefore all creation and, before all, as
saith the Scripture, the system of the heavens, declare the wisdom of the Creator in the skill
displayed by His works. And this is what it seems to me that he is desirous to set forth, viz.
the testimony of the things which do appear to the fact that the worlds were framed with
wisdom and skill, and abide for ever by the power of Him who is the Ruler over all. The
very heavens, he says, in displaying the wisdom of Him Who made them, all but shout aloud
with a voice, and, though without voice, proclaim the wisdom of their Creator. For we can
hear as it were words teaching us: “O men, when ye gaze upon us and behold our beauty
and magnitude, and this ceaseless revolution, with its well-ordered and harmonious motion,
working in the same direction and in the same manner, turn your thoughts to Him Who
presides over our system, and, by aid of the beauty which you see, imagine to yourselves the
beauty of the invisible Archetype. For in us there is nothing without its Lord, nothing that
moves of its own proper motion: but all that appears, or that is conceivable in respect to us,
depends on a Power Who is inscrutable and sublime.” This is not given in articulate speech,
but by the things which are seen, and it instils into our minds the knowledge of Divine power
more than if speech proclaimed it with a voice. As, then, the heavens declare, though they
do not speak, and the firmament shows God’s handy-work, yet requires no voice for the
purpose, and the day uttereth speech, though there is no speaking, and no one can say that
Holy Scripture is in error—in like manner, since both Moses and David have one and the

<pb n="517"/>
same Teacher, I mean the Holy Spirit, Who says that the fiat went before the creation, we
are not told that God is the Creator of words, but of things made known to us by the signification
of our words. For, lest we should suppose the creation to be without its Lord, and
spontaneously originated, He says that it was created by the Divine Being, and that it is established
in an orderly and connected system by Him. Now it would be a work of time to
discuss the order of what Moses didactically records in his historical summary respecting
the creation of the world. Or (if we did)1108 each second passage would serve to prove more
clearly the erroneous and futile character of our adversaries’ opinion. But whoever cares to
do so may read what we have written on Genesis, and judge whether our teaching or theirs
is the more reasonable.</p>
<p>But to return to the matter in question. We assert that the words “He said” do not imply
voice and words on the part of God; but the writer, in showing1109 the power of God to be
concurrent with His will, renders the idea more easy of apprehension. For since by the will
of God all things were created, and it is the ordinary way of men to signify their will first of
all by speech, and so to bring their work into harmony with their will, and the scriptural
account of the Creation is the learner’s introduction, as it were, to the knowledge of God,
representing to our minds the power of the Divine Being by objects more ready to our
comprehension (for sensible apprehension is an aid to intellectual knowledge), on this account,
Moses, by saying that God commanded all things to be, signifies to us the inciting
power of His will, and by adding, “and it was so,” he shows that in the case of God there is
no difference between will and performance; but, on the contrary, that though the purposing
initiates God’s activity, the accomplishment keeps pace with the purpose, and that the two
are to be considered together and at once, viz. the deliberate motion of the mind, and the
power that effects its purpose. For the idea of the Divine purpose and action leaves no conceivable
interval between them, but as light is produced along with the kindling of fire, at
once coming out from it and shining forth along with it—in the same manner the existence
of things created is an effect of the Divine will, but not posterior to it in time.</p>
<p>For the case is different from that of men endowed by nature with practical ability,
where you may look at capability and execution apart from each other. For example, we say
of a man who possesses the art of shipbuilding, that he is always a shipbuilder in respect of
his ability to build ships, but that he operates only when he displays his skill in working. It
is otherwise with God; for all that we can conceive as in Him is entirely work and action,
His will passing over immediately to its object. As, then, the mechanism of the heavens
testifies to the glory of their Creator and confesses Him Who made them, and needs no

<pb n="518"/>
voice for the purpose, so on the other hand any one who is acquainted with the Mosaic
Scripture will see that God speaks of the world as His creation, having brought the whole
into being by the fiat of His will, and that He needs no words to make known His mind. As,
then, he who heard the heavens declaring the glory of God looked not for set speech on the
occasion (for, to those who can understand it, the universe speaks through the things which
are being done, without regard or care for verbal explanation), so, even if any one hears
Moses telling how God gave order and arrangement to each several part of Creation by
name, let him not suppose the prophet to speak falsely, nor degrade the contemplation of
sublime verities by mean and grovelling notions, thus, as it were, reducing God to a mere
human standard, and supposing that after the manner of men he directs His operations by
the instrumentality of speech; but let His fiat mean His will only, and let the names of those
created things denote the mere reality of their coming into being. And thus he will learn
these two things from what is recorded: (1) That God made all things by His will, and (2)
that without any trouble or difficulty the Divine Will became nature.</p>
<p>But if any one would give a more sensuous interpretation to the words “God said,” as
proving that articulate speech was His creation, by a parity of reason he must understand
by the words “God saw,” that He did so by faculties of perception like our own, through the
organs of vision; and so again by the words “The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me,”
and again, “He smelled a sweet savour1110,” and whatever other sensuous expressions are
employed by Scripture in reference to head, or foot, or hand, or eyes, or fingers, or sandals,
as appertaining to God, taking them, I say, in their plain literal acceptation, he will present
to us an anthropomorphous deity, after the similitude of what is seen among ourselves. But
if any one hearing that the heavens are the work of His fingers, that He has a strong hand,
and a mighty arm, and eyes, and feet, and sandals, deduces from such words ideas worthy
of God, and does not degrade the idea of His pure nature by carnal and sensuous imaginations,
it will follow that on the one hand he will regard the verbal utterances as indications
of the Divine will, but on the other he will not conceive of them as articulate sounds, but
will reason thus; that the Creator of human reason has gifted us with speech proportionally
to the capacity of our nature, so that we might be able thereby to signify the thoughts of our
minds; but that, so far as the Divine nature differs from ours, so great will be the degree of
difference between our notions respecting it and its own inherent majesty and godhead.
And as our power compared with God’s, and our life with His life, is as nothing, and all else
that is ours, compared with what is in Him, is “as nothing in comparison1111” with Him,
as saith the inspired Teaching, so also our word as compared with Him, Who is the Word

indeed, is as nothing1112. For this word of yours was not in the beginning, but was created
along with our nature, nor is it to be regarded as having any reality of its own, but, as our
master (Basil) somewhere has said, it vanishes along with the sound of the voice, nor is any
operation of the word discernible, but it has its subsistence in voice only, or in written
characters. But the word of God is God Himself, the Word that was in the beginning and
that abideth for ever, through Whom all things were and are, Who ruleth over all, and hath
all power over the things in heaven and the things on earth, being Life, and Truth, and
Righteousness, and Light, and all that is good, and upholding all things in being. Such, then,
and so great being the word, as we understand it, of God, our opponent allows God, as some
great thing, the power of language, made up of nouns, verbs, and conjunctions, not perceiving
that, as He Who conferred practical powers on our nature is not spoken of as fabricating
each of their several results, but, while He gave our nature its ability, it is by us that a house
is constructed, or a bench, or a sword, or a plough, and whatsoever thing our life happens
to be in need of, each of which things is our own work, although it may be ascribed to Him
Who is the author of our being, and Who created our nature capable of every science,—so
also our power of speech is the work of Him Who made our nature what it is, but the invention
of each several term required to denote objects in hand is of our own devising. And
this is proved by the fact that many terms in use are of a base and unseemly character, of
which no man of sense would conceive God the inventor: so that, if certain of our familiar
expressions are ascribed by Holy Scripture to God as the speaker, we should remember that
the Holy Spirit is addressing us in language of our own, as e.g. in the history of the Acts we
are told that each man received the teaching of the disciples in his own language wherein
he was born, understanding the sense of the words by the language which he knew. And,
that this is true, may be seen yet more clearly by a careful examination of the enactments
of the Levitical law. For they make mention of pans, and cakes, and fine flour1113, and the
like, in the mystic sacrifices, instilling wholesome doctrine under the veil of symbol and
enigma. Mention, too, is made of certain measures then in use, such as ephah, and nebel1114,
and hin, and the like. Are we, then, to suppose that God made these names and appellations,
or that in the beginning He commanded them to be such, and to be so named, calling one
kind of grain wheat, and its pith flour, and flat sweetmeats, whether heavy or light, cakes;
and that He commanded a vessel of the kind in which a moist lump is boiled or baked to

be called a pan, or that He spoke of a certain liquid measure by the name of hin or nebel,
and measured dry produce by the homer? surely it is trifling and mere Jewish folly, far removed
from the grandeur of Christian simplicity, to think that God, Who is the Most High
and above every name and thought, Who by sole virtue of His will governs the world, which
He brought into existence, and upholds it in being, should set Himself like some schoolmaster
to settle the niceties of terminology. Rather let us say, that as we indicate to the deaf what
we want them to do, by gestures and signs, not because we have no voice of our own, but
because a verbal communication would be utterly useless to those who cannot hear, so, in
as much as human nature is in a sense deaf and insensible to higher truths, we maintain
that the grace of God at sundry times and in divers manners spake by the Prophets, ordering
their voices conformably to our capacity and the modes of expression with which we are
familiar, and that by such means it leads us, as with a guiding hand, to the knowledge of
higher truths, not teaching us in terms proportioned to their inherent sublimity, (for how
can the great be contained by the little?) but descending to the lower level of our limited
comprehension. And as God, after giving animals their power of motion, no longer prescribes
each step they take, for their nature, having once for all taken its beginning from the Creator,
moves of itself, and makes its way, adapting its power of motion to its object from time to
time (except in so far as it is said that a man’s steps are directed by the Lord), so our nature,
having received from God the power of speech and utterance and of expressing the will by
the voice, proceeds on its way through things, giving them distinctive names by varying
inflections of sound; and these signs are the verbs and nouns which we use, and through
which we signify the meaning of the things. And though the word “fruit” is made use of by
Moses before the creation of fruit, and “seed” before that of seed, this does not disprove our
assertion, nor is the sense of the lawgiver opposed to what we have said in respect to thought
and conception. For that end of past husbandry which we speak of as fruit, and that beginning
of future husbandry which we speak of as seed, this thing, I mean, underlying these
names,—whether wheat or some other produce which is increased and multiplied by sowing—
does not, he teaches us, grow spontaneously, but by the will of Him Who created them
to grow with their peculiar power, so as to be the same fruit and to reproduce themselves
as seed, and to support mankind with their increase. And by the Divine will the thing is
produced, not the name, so that the substantial thing1115 is the work of the Creator, but the
distinguishing names of things, by which speech furnishes us with a clear and accurate de-

scription of them, are the work and the invention of man’s reasoning faculty, though the
reasoning faculty itself and its nature are a work of God. And since all men are endowed
with reason, differences of language will of necessity be found according to differences of
country. But if any one maintain that light, or heaven, or earth, or seed were named after
human fashion by God, he will certainly conclude that they were named in some special
language. What that was, let him show. For he who knows the one thing will not, in all
probability, be ignorant of the other. For at the river Jordan, after the descent of the Holy
Ghost, and again in the hearing of the Jews, and at the Transfiguration, there came a voice
from heaven, teaching men not only to regard the phenomenon as something more than a
figure, but also to believe the beloved Son of God to be truly God. Now that voice was
fashioned by God, suitably to the understanding of the hearers, in airy substance, and adapted
to the language of the day, God, “who willeth that all men should be saved and come to the
knowledge of the truth1116,” having so articulated His words in the air with a view to the
salvation of the hearers, as our Lord also saith to the Jews, when they thought it thundered
because the sound took place in the air. “This voice came not because of Me, but for your
sakes1117.” But before the creation of the world, inasmuch as there was no one to hear the
word, and no bodily element capable of accentuating the articulate voice, how can he who
says that God used words give any air of probability to his assertion? God Himself is without
body, creation did not yet exist. Reason does not suffer us to conceive of anything material
in respect to Him. They who might have been benefited by the hearing were not yet created.
And if men were not yet in being, neither had any form of language been struck out in accordance
with national peculiarities, by what arguments, then, can he who looks to the bare
letter make good his assertion, that God spoke thus using human parts of speech?</p>
<p>And the futility of such assertions may be seen also by this. For as the natures of the
elements, which are the work of the Creator, appear alike to all, and there is no difference
to human sense in men’s experience of fire, or air, or water, but the nature of each is one
and unchanging, working in the same way, and suffering no modification from the differences
of those who partake of it, so also the imposition of names, if applied to things by God,
would have been the same for all. But, in point of fact, while the nature of things as constituted
by God remains the same, the names which denote them are divided by so many differences
of language, that it were no easy task even to calculate their number.</p>

<p>And if any one cites the confusion of tongues that took place at the building of the tower,
as contradicting what I have said, not even there is God spoken of as creating men’s languages,
but as confounding the existing one1118, that all might not hear all. For when all lived together
and were not as yet divided by various differences of race, the aggregate of men dwelt
together with one language among them; but when by the Divine will it was decreed that
all the earth should be replenished by mankind, then, their community of tongue being
broken up, men were dispersed in various directions and adopted this and that form of
speech and language, possessing a certain bond of union in similarity of tongue, not indeed
disagreeing from others in their knowledge of things, but differing in the character of their
names. For a stone or a stick does not seem one thing to one man and another to another,
but the different peoples call them by different names. So that our position remains unshaken,
that human language is the invention of the human mind or understanding. For from the
beginning, as long as all men had the same language, we see from Holy Scripture that men
received no teaching of God’s words, nor, when men were separated into various differences
of language, did a Divine enactment prescribe how each man should talk. But God, willing
that men should speak different languages, gave human nature full liberty to formulate arbitrary
sounds, so as to render their meaning more intelligible. Accordingly, Moses, who
lived many generations after the building of the tower, uses one of the subsequent languages
in his historical narrative of the creation, and attributes certain words to God, relating these
things in his own tongue in which he had been brought up, and with which he was familiar,
not changing the names for God by foreign peculiarities and turns of speech, in order by
the strangeness and novelty of the expressions to prove them the words of God Himself1119.</p>
<p>But some who have carefully studied the Scriptures tell us that the Hebrew tongue is
not even ancient1120 like the others, but that along with other miracles this miracle was
wrought in behalf of the Israelites, that after the Exodus from Egypt, the language was

hastily improvised1121 for the use of the nation. And there is a1122 passage in the Prophet
which confirms this. For he says, “when he came out of the land of Egypt he heard a strange
language1123.” If, then, Moses was a Hebrew, and the language of the Hebrews was subsequent
to the others, Moses, I say, who was born some thousands of years after the Creation of the
world, and who relates the words of God in his own language—does he not clearly teach us
that he does not attribute to God such a language of human fashion, but that he speaks as
he does because it was impossible otherwise than in human language to express his meaning,
though the words he uses have some Divine and profound significance?</p>
<p>For to suppose that God used the Hebrew tongue, when there was no one to hear and
understand such a language, methinks no reasonable being will consent. We read in the
Acts that the Divine power divided itself into many languages for this purpose, that no one
of alien tongue might lose his share of the benefit. But if God spoke in human language before
the Creation, whom was He to benefit by using it? For that His speech should have some
adaptation to the capacity of the hearers, with a view to their profit, no one would conceive
to be unworthy of God’s love to man, for Paul the follower of Christ knew how to adapt his
words suitably to the habits and disposition of his hearers, making himself milk for babes
and strong meat for grown men1124. But where no object was to be gained by such use of
<note type="footnote">1121 hastily improvised. But Origen, c. Celsum iii. 6, says—“Celsus has not shewn himself a just critic of the
differing accounts of the Egyptians and the Jews.…He does not see that it was not possible for so large a number
of rebellious Egyptians, after starting off in this way, to have changed their language at the very moment of their
insurrection, and so become a separate nation, so that those who one day spoke Egyptian suddenly spoke a
complete Hebrew dialect. Allow for a moment that when they left Egypt they rejected also their mother tongue;
how was it that, thereupon, they did not adopt the Syrian or Phoenician, but the Hebrew which was so different
from both these?…For the Hebrew had been their national language before they went down into Egypt:” And,
i. 16—“I wonder how Celsus can admit the Odrysians amongst the most ancient as well as the wisest peoples,
but will admit the Jews into neither, notwithstanding that there are many books in Egypt and Phoenicia and
Greece which testify to their antiquity. Any one who likes can read Flavius Josephus’ two books on the antiquity
of the Jews, where he makes a large collection of writers who witness to this.” And yet, iii. 7, he goes on to say
(what Gregory is here alluding to) that while any way the Hebrew language was never Egyptian, “yet if we look
deeper, we might find it possible to say in the case of the Exodus that there was a miracle: viz. the whole mass
of the Hebrew people receiving a language; that such language was the gift of God, as one of their own prophets
has expressed it, ‘when he came out of Egypt, he heard a strange language.’”</note>

language, to argue that God, as it were, declaimed such words by Himself, when there was
no one in need of the information they would convey—such an idea, methinks, is at once
both blasphemous and absurd. Neither, then, did God speak in the Hebrew language, nor
did He express Himself according to any form in use among the Gentiles. But whatsoever
of God’s words are recorded by Moses or the Prophets, are indications of the Divine will,
flashing forth, now in one way, now in another, on the pure intellect of those holy men, according
to the measure of the grace of which they were partakers. Moses, then, spoke his
mother-tongue, and that in which he was educated. But he attributed these words to God,
as I have said, repeatedly, on account of the childishness of those who were being brought
to the knowledge of God, in order to give a clear representation of the Divine will, and to
render his hearers more obedient, as being awed by the authority of the speaker.</p>
<p>But this is denied by Eunomius, the author of all this contumely with which we are assailed,
and the companion and adviser of this impious band. For, changing insolence into
courtesy, I will present him with his own words. He maintains, in so many words, that he
has the testimony of Moses himself to his assertion that men were endowed with the use of
the things named, and of their names, by the Creator of nature, and that the naming of the
things given was prior in time to the creation of those who should use them. Now, if he is
in possession of some Moses of his own, from whom he has learned this wisdom, and,
making this his base of operations, relies on such statements as these, viz. that God, as he
himself says, lays down the laws of human speech, enacting that things shall be called in
one way and not in another, let him trifle as much as he pleases, with his Moses in the
background to support his assertions. But if there is only one Moses whose writings are the
common source of instruction to those who are learned in the Divine Word, we will freely
accept our condemnation if we find ourselves refuted by the law of that Moses. But where
did he find this law respecting verbs and nouns? Let him produce it in the very words of the
text. The account of the Creation, and the genealogy of the successive generations, and the
history of certain events, and the complex system of legislation, and various regulations in
regard to religious service and daily life, these are the chief heads of the writings of Moses.
But, if he says that there was any legislative enactment in regard to words, let him point it
out, and I will hold my tongue. But he cannot; for, if he could, he would not abandon the
more striking evidences of the Deity, for such as can only procure him ridicule, and not
credit, from men of sense. For to think it the essential point in piety to attribute the invention
of words to God, Whose praise the whole world and the wonders that are therein are incompetent
to celebrate—must it not be a proceeding of extreme folly so to neglect higher grounds
of praise, and to magnify God on such as are purely human? His fiat preluded Creation, but
it was recorded by Moses after human fashion, though Divinely issued. That will of God,
then, which brought about the creation of the world by His Divine power, consisted, says
our careful student of the Scriptures, in the teaching of words. And as though God had said,

<pb n="525"/>
“Let there be a word,” or, “Let speech be created,” or, “Let this or that have such or such an
appellation,” so, in advocacy of his trifling, he brings forward the fact that it was by the impulse
of the Divine will that Creation took place. For with all his study and experience in
the Scriptures he knows not even this, that the impulse of the mind is frequently spoken of
in Scripture as a voice. And for this we have the evidence of Moses himself, whose meaning
he frequently perverts, but whom on this point he simply ignores. For who is there, however
slightly acquainted with the holy volume, who does not know this, that the people of Israel
who had just escaped1125 from Egypt were suddenly affrighted in the wilderness by the
pursuit of the Egyptians, and when dangers encompassed them on all sides, and on one side
the sea cut off their passage as by a wall, while the enemy barred their flight in the rear, the
people coming together to the Prophet charged him with being the cause of their helpless
condition? And when he comforted them in their abject terror, and roused them to courage,
a voice came from God, addressing the Prophet by name, “Wherefore criest thou unto
Me?1126” And yet before this the narrative makes no mention of any utterance on the part
of Moses. But the thought which the Prophet had lifted up to God is called a cry, though
uttered in silence in the hidden thought of his heart. If, then, Moses cries, though without
speaking, as witnessed by Him Who hears, those “groanings which cannot be uttered1127,”
is it strange that the Prophet, knowing the Divine will, so far as it was lawful for him to tell
it and for us to hear it, revealed it by known and familiar words, describing God’s discourse
after human fashion, not indeed expressed in words, but signified by the effects themselves?
“In the beginning,” he says, “God created,” not the names of heaven and earth, but, “the
heaven and the earth1128.” And again, “God said, Let there be light,” not the name Light:
and having divided the light from the darkness, “God called,” he says, “the light Day, and
the darkness He called Night.”</p>
<p>On these passages it is probable that our opponents will take their stand. And I will
agree for them with what is said, and will myself take advantage of their positions1129 further

on in our inquiry, in order that what we teach may be more firmly established, no point in
controversy being left without due examination. “God called,” he says, “the firmament
Heaven, and He called the dry land Earth, and the light Day, and the darkness He called
Night.” How comes it, then, they will ask, when the Scripture admits that their appellations
were given them by God, that you say that their names are the work of human invention?
What, then, is our reply? We return to our plain statement, and we assert, that He Who
brought all creation into being out of nothing is the Creator of things seen in substantial
existence, not of unsubstantial words having no existence but in the sound of the voice and
the lisp of the tongue. But things are named by the indication of the voice in conformity
with the nature and qualities inherent in each, the names being adapted to the things according
to the vernacular language of each several race.</p>
<p>But since the nature of most things that are seen in Creation is not simple, so as to allow
of all that they connote being comprehended in one word, as, for instance, in the case of
fire, the element itself is one thing in its nature, while the word which denotes it is another
(for fire itself possesses the qualities of shining, of burning, of drying and heating, and
consuming whatever fuel it lays hold of, but the name is but a brief word of one syllable),
on this account speech, which distinguishes the powers and qualities seen in fire, gives each
of them a name of its own, as I have said before. And one cannot say that only a name has
been given to fire when it is spoken of as bright, or consuming, or anything else that we
observe it to be. For such words denote qualities physically inherent in it. So likewise, in the
case of heaven and the firmament, though one nature is signified by each of these words,
their difference represents one or other of its peculiar characteristics, in looking at which
we learn one thing by the appellation “heaven,” and another by “firmament.” For when
speech would define the limit of sensible creation, beyond which it is succeeded by the
transmundane void apprehended by the mind alone, in contrast with the intangible and
incorporeal and invisible, the beginning and the end of all material subsistences is called
the firmament. And when we survey the environment of terrestrial things, we call that which
encompasses all material nature, and which forms the boundary of all things visible, by the
name of heaven. In the same manner with regard to earth and dry land, since all heavy and
downward-tending nature was divided into these two elements, earth and water, the appellation
“dry” defines to a certain extent its opposite, for earth is called dry in opposition to
moist, since having thrown off, by Divine command, the water that overspread it, it appeared
in its own character. But the name “earth” does not continue to express the signification of
some one only of its qualities, but, by virtue of its meaning, it embraces all that the word
connotes, e.g. hardness, density, weight, resistance, capability of supporting animal and vegetable
life. Accordingly, the word “dry” was not changed by speech to the last name put
upon it (for its new name did not make it cease to be called so), but while both the appellations
remained, a peculiar signification attached itself to each, the one distinguishing it in

<pb n="527"/>
nature and property from its opposite, the other embracing all its attributes collectively.
And so in light and day, and again in night and darkness, we do not find a pronunciation
of syllables created to suit them by the Maker of all things, but rather through these appellations
we note the substance of the things which they signify. At the entrance of light, by the
will of God the darkness that prevailed over the earliest creation is scattered. But the earth
lying in the midst, and being upheld on all sides by its surrounding of different elements,
as Job saith, “He hangeth the earth upon nothing1130,” it was necessary when light travelled
over one side and the earth obstructed it on the opposite by its own bulk, that a side of
darkness should be left by the obscuration, and so, as the perpetual motion of the heavens
cannot but carry along with it the darkness resulting from the obscuration, God ordained
this revolution for a measure of duration of time. And that measure is day and night. For
this reason Moses, according to his wisdom, in his historical elucidation of these matters,
named the shadow resulting from the earth’s obstruction, a dividing of the light from the
darkness, and the constant and measured alternation of light and darkness over the surface
of the earth he called day and night. So that what was called light was not named day, but
as “there was light,” and not the bare name of light, so the measure of time also was created
and the name followed, not created by God in a sound of words, but because the very nature
of the thing assumed this vocal notation. And as, if it had been plainly said by the Lawgiver
that nothing that is seen or named is of spontaneous generation or unfashioned, but that it
has its subsistence from God, we might have concluded of ourselves that God made the
world and all its parts, and the order which is seen in them, and the faculty of distinguishing
them, so also by what he says he leads us on to understand and believe that nothing which
exists is without beginning. And with this view he describes the successive events of Creation
in orderly method, enumerating them one after another. But it was impossible to represent
them in language, except by expressing their signification by words that should indicate it.
Since, then, it is written that God called the light day, it must be understood that God made
the day from light, being something different, by the force of the term. For you cannot apply
the same definition to “light” and “day,” but light is what we understand by the opposite of
darkness, and day is the extent of the measure of the interval of light. In the same way you
may regard night and darkness by the same difference of description, defining darkness as
the negation of light, and calling night the extent of the encompassing darkness. Thus in
every way our argument is confirmed, though not, perhaps, drawn out in strict logical
form—showing that God is the Maker of things, not of empty words. For things have their
names not for His sake but for ours. For as we cannot always have all things before our eyes,
we take knowledge of some of the things that are present with us from time to time, and
others we register in our memories. But it would be impossible to keep memory unconfused
<note type="footnote">1130 Job xxvi. 7.</note>

<pb n="528"/>
unless we had the notation of words to distinguish the things that are stored up in our minds
from one another. But to God all things are present, nor does He need memory, all things
being within the range of His penetrating vision. What need, then, in His case, of parts of
speech, when His own wisdom and power embraces and holds the nature of all things distinct
and unconfused? Wherefore all things that exist substantially are from God; but, for our
guidance, all things that exist are provided with names to indicate them. And if any one say
that such names were imposed by the arbitrary usage of mankind, he will be guilty of no
offence against the scheme of Divine Providence. For we do not say that the nature of things
was of human invention, but only their names. The Hebrew calls Heaven by one name, the
Canaanite by another, but both of them understand it alike, being in no way led into error
by the difference of the sounds that convey the idea of the object. But the over-cautious and
timid will-worship of these clever folk, on whose authority he asserts that, if it were granted
that words were given to things by men, men would be of higher authority than God, is
proved to be unsubstantial even by the example which we find recorded of Moses. For who
gave Moses his name? Was it not Pharaoh’s daughter who named him from what had
happened1131? For water is called Moses in the language of the Egyptians. Since, then, in
consequence of the tyrant’s order, his parents had placed the babe in an ark and consigned
it to the stream (for so some related concerning him), but by the will of God the ark was
floated by the current and carried to the bank, and found by the princess, who happened
just then to be taking the refreshment of the bath, as the child had been gained “from the
water,” she is said to have given him his name as a memorial of the occurrence,—a name
by which God Himself did not disdain to address His servant, nor did He deem it beneath
Him to allow the name given by the foreign woman to remain the Prophet’s proper appellation.</p>
<p>In like manner before him Jacob, having taken hold of his brother’s heel, was called a
supplanter1132, from the attitude in which he came to the birth. For those who are learned
in such matters tell us that such is the interpretation of the word “Jacob,” as translated into
Greek. So, too, Pharez was so named by his nurse from the incident at his birth1133, yet no
one on that account, like Eunomius, displayed any jealousy of his assuming an authority
above that of God. Moreover the mothers of the patriarchs gave them their names, as Reuben,
and Simeon, and Levi1134, and all those who came after them. And no one started up, like
our new author, as patron of Divine providence, to forbid women to usurp Divine authority
by the imposition of names. And what shall we say of other particulars in the sacred record,

such as the “waters of strife,” and the “place of mourning,” and the “hill of the foreskins,”
and the “valley of the cluster,” and the “field of blood,” and such-like names, of human imposing,
but oftentimes recorded to have been uttered by the Person of God, from which we
may learn that men may notify the meaning of things by words without presumption, and
that the Divine nature does not depend on words for its evidence to itself?</p>
<p>But I will pass over his other babblings against the truth, possessing as they do no force
against our doctrines, for I deem it superfluous to linger any longer over such absurdities.
For who can be so wanting in the more important subjects of thought as to waste energy
on silly arguments, and to contend with men who speak of us as asserting that “man’s
forethought is of superior weight and authority to God’s guardianship,” and that we “ascribe
the carelessness which confuses the feebler minds to the providence of God”? These are the
exact words of our calumniator. But I, for my part, think it equally as absurd to pay attention
to remarks like that, as to occupy myself with old wives’ dreams. For to think of securing
the dignity of rule and sovereignty to the Divine Being by a form of words, and to show the
great power of God to be dependent upon this, and on the other hand to neglect Him and
disregard the providence which belongs to Him, and to lay it to our reproach that men,
having received from God the faculty of reason, make an arbitrary use of words to signify
things—what is this but an old wife’s fable, or a drunkard’s dream? For the true power, and
authority, and dominion, and sovereignty of God do not, we think, consist in syllables. Were
it so, any and every inventor of words might claim equal honour with God. But the infinite
ages, and the beauties of the universe, and the beams of the heavenly luminaries, and all the
wonders of land and sea, and the angelic hosts and supra-mundane powers, and whatever
else there is whose existence in the realm above is revealed to us under various figures by
Holy Scripture—these are the things that bear witness to God’s power over all. Whereas, to
attribute the invention of vocal sound to those who are naturally endowed with the faculty
of speech, this involves no impiety towards Him Who gave them their voice. Nor indeed
do we hold it to be a great thing to invent words significative of things. For the being to
whom Holy Scripture in the history of the creation gave the name of “man1135” (ἄνθρωπος),
a word of human devising, that same being Job calls “mortal1136” (βροτός), while of profane
writers, some call him “human being” (φώς), and others “articulate speaker” (μέροψ)—to
say nothing of other varieties of the name. Do we, then, elevate them to equal honour with
God, because they also invented names equivalent to that of “man,” alike signifying their
subject. But, as I have said before, let us leave this idle talk, and make no account of his
string of revilings, in which he charges us with lying against the Divine oracles, and uttering
slanders with effrontery even against God.</p>

<p>To pass on, then, to what remains. He brings forward once more some of the Master’s
words, to this effect: “And it is in precisely the same manner that we are taught by Holy
Scripture the employment of a conception. Our Lord Jesus Christ, when declaring to men
the nature of His Godhead, explains it by certain special characteristics, calling Himself the
Door, the Bread, the Way, the Vine, the Shepherd, the Light.” Now I think it seemly to pass
over his insolent remarks on these words (for it is thus that his rhetorical training has taught
him to contend with his opponents), nor will I suffer myself to be disturbed by his ebullitions
of childish folly. Let us, however, examine one pungent and “irresistible” argument which
he puts forward for our refutation. Which of the sacred writers, he asks, gives evidence that
these names were attributed to our Lord by a conception? But which of them, I reply, forbids
it, deeming it a blasphemy to regard such names as the result of a conception? For if he
maintains that its not being mentioned is a proof that it is forbidden, by a parity of reasoning
he must admit that its not being forbidden is an argument that it is permitted. Is our Lord
called by these names, or does Eunomius deny this also? If he does deny that these names
are spoken of Christ, we have conquered without a battle. For what more signal victory
could there be, than to prove our adversary to be fighting against God, by robbing the sacred
words of the Gospel of their meaning? But if he admits that it is true that Christ is named
by these names, let him say in what manner they may be applied without irreverence to the
Only-begotten Son of God. Does he take “the stone” as indicative of His nature? Does he
understand His essence under the figure of the Axe (not to encumber our argument by
enumerating the rest)? None of these names represents the nature of the Only-begotten, or
His Godhead, or the peculiar character of His essence. Nevertheless He is called by these
names, and each appellation has its own special fitness. For we cannot, without irreverence,
suppose anything in the words of God to be idle and unmeaning. Let him say, then, if he
disallows these names as the result of a conception, how do they apply to Christ? For we on
our part say this, that as our Lord provided for human life in various forms, each variety of
His beneficence is suitably distinguished by His several names, His provident care and
working on our behalf passing over into the mould of a name. And such a name is said by
us to be arrived at by a conception. But if this is not agreeable to our opponents, let it be as
each of them pleases. In his ignorance, however, of the figures of Scripture, our opponent
contradicts what is said. For if he had learned the Divine names, he must have known that
our Lord is called a Curse and Sin1137, and a Heifer1138, and a lion’s Whelp1139, and a Bear
bereaved of her whelps1140, and a Leopard1141 and such-like names, according to various

<pb n="531"/>
modes of conception, by Holy Scripture, the sacred and inspired writers by such names, as
by well-directed shafts, indicating the central point of the idea they had in view; even though
these words, when taken in their literal and obvious signification, seem not above suspicion,
but each single one of them, unless we allow it to be predicated of God by some process of
conception, will not escape the taint of a blasphemous suggestion. But it would be a lengthy
task to bring them forward, and elucidate in every case how, in the general idea, these words
have been perverted1142 out of their obvious meanings, and how it is only in connection
with the conceptive faculty that the names of God can be reconciled with that reverence
which is His due.</p>
<p>But to return. Such names are used of our Lord, and no one familiar with the inspired
Scriptures can deny the fact. What then? Does Eunomius affirm that the words are indicative
of His nature itself? If so, he asserts that the Divine nature is multiform, and that the variety
which it displays in what is signified by the names is very complex. For the meanings of the
words Bread and Lion are not the same, nor those of Axe and Water1143, but to each of
them we can assign a definition of its own, of which the others do not partake. They do not,
therefore, signify nature or essence, yet no one will presume to say that this nomenclature
is quite inappropriate and unmeaning. If, then, these words are given us, but not as indicative
of essence, and every word given in Scripture is just and appropriate, how else can these
appellations be fitly applied to the Only-begotten Son of God, except in connection with
the faculty of conception? For it is clear that the Divine Being is spoken of under various
names, according to the variety of His operations, so that we may think of Him in the aspect
so named. What harm, then, is done to our reverential ideas of God by this mental operation,
instituted with a view to our thinking upon the things done, and which we call conception,
though if any one choose to call it by some other name, we shall make no objection.</p>
<p>But, like a mighty wrestler, he will not relinquish his irresistible hold on us, and affirms
in so many words, that “these names are the work of human thought and conception, and
that, by the exercise of this operation of the mind by some, results are arrived at which no
Apostle or Evangelist has taught.” And after this doughty onslaught he raises that sanctimonious
voice of his, spitting out his foul abuse at us with a tongue well schooled to such lan-

guage. “For,” says he, “to ascribe homonyms, drawn from analogy, to human thought and
conception is the work of a mind that has lost all judicial sense, and that studies the words
of the Lord with an enfeebled understanding and dishonest habit of thought.” Mercy on us!
what a logical argument! how scientifically it proceeds to its conclusion! Who after this will
dare to speak up for the cause of conception, when such a stench is poured forth from his
mouth upon those who attempt speaking? I suppose, then, that we, who do attempt speaking,
must forbear to examine his argument, for fear of his stirring up against us the cesspool of
his abuse. And verily it is weak-minded1144 to let ourselves be irritated by childish absurdities.
We will therefore allow our insolent adversary full liberty to indulge in his method as he
will. But we will return to the Master’s argument, that thence too we may muster reinforcements
for the truth. Eunomius has been reminded of “analogy” and has perceived “the
homonyms to be derived from it.” Now where or from whom did he learn these terms? Not
from Moses, not from the Prophets and Apostles, not from the Evangelists. It is impossible
that he should have learned them from the teaching of any Scripture. How came he, then,
to use them? The very word which describes this or that signification of a thought as analogy,
is it not the invention of the thinking faculty of him who utters it1145? How is it, then, that
he fails to perceive that he is using the views he fights against as his allies in the war? For he
makes war against our principle of words being formed by the operation of conception, and
would endeavour to establish, by the aid of words formed on that very principle, that it is
unlawful to use them. “It is not,” says he, “the teaching of any of the sacred writers.” To
whom, then, of the ancients do you yourself ascribe the term “ungenerate,” and its being
predicated of the essence of God? or is it allowable for you, when you want to establish some
of your impious conclusions, to coin and invent terms to your own liking; but if anything
is said by some one else in contravention of your impiety, to deprive your adversary of
similar licence? Great indeed would be the power you would assume if you could make good
your claim to such authority as this, that what you refuse to others should be allowable to
you alone, and that what you yourself presume to do by virtue of it, you should prevent
others from doing. You condemn, as by an edict, the doctrine that these names were applied
to Christ as a result of conception, because none of the sacred writers have declared that
they ought so to be applied. How, then, can you lay down the law that the Divine essence
should be denoted by the word “ungenerate”—a term which none of the sacred writers can
be shown to have handed down to us? For if this is the test of the right use of words, that
only such shall be employed as the inspired word of Scripture shall authorize, the word
“ungenerate” must be erased from your own writings, since none of the sacred writers has

sanctioned the expression. But perhaps you accept it by reason of the sense that resides in
it. Well, we ourselves in the same way accept the term “conception” by reason of the sense
that resides in it. Accordingly we will either exclude both from use, or neither, and whichever
alternative be adopted, we are equally masters of the field. For if the term “ungenerate” be
altogether suppressed, all our adversaries’ clamour against the truth is suppressed along
with it, and a doctrine worthy of the Only-begotten Son of God will shine forth, inasmuch
as logical opposition can furnish no name1146 to detract from the majesty of the Lord. But
if both be retained, in that case also the truth will prevail, and we along with it, when we
have altered the word “ungeneracy” from the substance, into a conception, of the Deity. But
so long as he does not exclude the term “ungenerate” from his own writings, let our modern
Pharisee admonish himself not to behold the mote that is in our eye, before he has cast out
the beam that is in his own.</p>
<p>“But God,” he says, “gave the weakest of terrestrial things a share in the most honourable
names, though not giving them an equal share of dignity, and to the highest He imparted
the names of the lowest, though the natural inferiority of the latter was not transferred to
the former along with their names.” We quote this in his very words. If they contain some
deep and recondite meaning which has escaped us, let those inform us who see what is
beyond our range of vision—initiated as they are by him in his esoteric and unspeakable
mysteries. But if they admit of no interpretation beyond what is obvious, I scarcely know
which of the two are more to be pitied, those who say such things or those who listen to
them. To the weakest of terrestrial things, he says, God has given names in common with
the most honourable, though not giving them an equal share of dignity. Let us examine
what is meant by this. The weakest things, he says, are dignified with the bare name belonging
to the honourable, their nature not corresponding with their name. And this he states to be
the work of the God of truth—to dignify the worse nature with the worthier appellation!
On the other hand, he says that God applies the less honourable names to things superior
in their nature, the nature of the latter not being carried over to the former along with the
appellation. But that the matter may be made plainer still, the absurdity shall be shown by
actual instances. If any one should call a man who is esteemed for every virtue, intemperate;
or, on the other hand, a man equally in disrepute for his vices, good and moral, would
sensible people think him of sound mind, or one who had any regard for truth, reversing,
as would be the case, the meanings of words, and giving them a non-natural signification?
I for my part think not. He speaks, then, of things relating to God, out of all keeping with
our common ideas and with the holy Scriptures. For in matters of ordinary life it is only
those who are unsettled by drink or madness that go wrong in names, and use them out of
their proper meaning, calling, it may be, a man a dog, or vice versa. But Holy Scripture is

so far from sanctioning such confusion, that we may clearly hear the voice of prophecy
lamenting it. “Woe unto him,” says Isaiah, “that calls darkness light, and light darkness, that
calls bitter sweet, and sweet bitter1147.” Now what induces Eunomius to apply this absurdity
to his God? Let those who are initiated in his mysteries say what they judge those weakest
of terrestrial things to be, which God has dignified with most honourable appellations. The
weakest of existing things are those animals whose generation takes place from the corruption
of moist elements, as the most honourable are virtue, and holiness, and whatever else is
pleasing in the sight of God. Are flies, then, and midges, and frogs, and whatever insects are
generated from dung, dignified with the names of holiness and virtue, so as to be consecrated
with honourable names, though not sharing in such high qualities, as saith Eunomius? But
never as yet have we heard anything like this, that these weak things are called by highsounding
titles, or that what is great and honourable by nature is degraded by the name of
any one of them. Noah was a righteous man, saith the Scripture, Abraham was faithful,
Moses meek, Daniel wise, Joseph chaste, Job blameless, David perfect in patience. Let them
say, then, whether all these had their names by contraries; or, to take the case of those who
are unfavourably spoken of, as Nabal the Carmelite, and Pharaoh the Egyptian, and
Abimelech the alien, and all those who are mentioned for their vices, whether they were
dignified with honourable names by the voice of God. Not so! But God judges and distinguishes
His creatures as they are in nature and truth, not by names contrary to them, but
by such appropriate appellations as may give the clearest idea of their meaning.</p>
<p>This it is that our strong-minded opponent, who accuses us of dishonesty, and charges
us with being irrational in judgment,—this it is that he pretends to know of the Divine
nature. These are the opinions that he puts forth respecting God, as though He mocked His
creatures with names untrue to their meaning, bestowing on the weakest the most honourable
appellations, and pouring contempt on the honourable by making them synonymous with
the base. Now a virtuous man, if carried, even involuntarily, beyond the limits of truth, is
overwhelmed with shame. Yet Eunomius thinks it no shame to God that He should seem
to give a false colour to things by their appellations. Not such is the testimony of the Scriptures
to the Divine nature. “God is long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth,” says
David1148. But how can He be a God of truth Who gives false names to things, and Who
perverts the truth in the meanings of their names? Again, He is called by him a righteous
Lord1149. Is it, then, a righteous thing to dignify things without honour by honourable
names, and, while giving the bare name, to grudge the honour that it denotes? Such is the
testimony of these Theologians to their new-fangled God. This is the end of their boasted

dialectic cleverness, to display God Himself delighting in deceit, and not superior to the
passion of jealousy. For surely it is no better than deceit not to name weak things, as they
are in their true nature and worth, but to invest them with empty names, derived from superior
things, not proportioning their value to their name; and it is no better than jealousy
if, having it in His power to bestow the more honourable appellation on things to be named
for some superiority, He grudged them the honour itself, as deeming the happiness of the
weak a loss to Himself personally. But I should recommend all who are wise, even if the
God of these Gnostics1150 is by stress of logic shown to be of such a character, not to think
thus of the true God, the Only-begotten, but to look at the truth of facts, giving each of them
their due, and thence to deduce His name. “Come, ye blessed,” saith our Lord; and again,
“Depart, ye cursed1151,” not honouring him who deserves cursing with the name of “blessed,”
nor, on the other hand, dismissing him who has treasured up for himself the blessing, along
with the wicked.</p>
<p>But what is our author’s meaning, and what is the object of this argument of his? For
no one need imagine that, for lack of something to say, in order that he may seem to extend
his discourse to the utmost, he has indulged in all this senseless twaddle. Its very senselessness
is not without a meaning, and smacks of heresy. For to say that the most honourable names
are applied to the weakest things, though not having by nature an equal apportionment of
dignity, secretly paves the way, as it were, for the blasphemy to follow, that he may teach
his disciples this; that although the Only-begotten is called God, and Wisdom, and Power,
and Light, and the Truth, and the Judge, and the King, and God over all, and the great God,
and the Prince of peace, and the Father of the world to come, and so forth, His honour is
limited to the name.</p>
<p>He does not, in fact, partake of that dignity which the meaning of those names indicates;
and whereas wise Daniel, in setting right the Babylonians’ error of idolatry, that they should
not worship the brazen image or the dragon, but reverence the name of God, which men
in their folly had ascribed to them, clearly showed by what he did that the high and lofty
name of God had no likeness to the reptile, or to the image of molten brass—this enemy of
God exerts himself in his teaching to prove the very opposite of this in regard to the Onlybegotten
Son of God, exclaiming in the style which he affects, “Do not regard the names of
which our Lord is a partaker, so as to infer His unspeakable and sublime nature. For many
of the weakest things are likewise invested with names of honour, lofty indeed in sound,
though their nature is not transformed so as to come up to the grandeur of their appellations.”
Accordingly he says that inferior things receive their honour from God only so far as their

names go, no equality of dignity accompanying their appellations. When, therefore, we have
learned all the names of the Son that are of lofty signification, we must bear in mind that
the honour which they imply is ascribed to Him only so far as the words go, but that, according
to the system of nomenclature which they adopt, He does not partake of the dignity
implied by the words.</p>
<p>But in dwelling on such nonsense I fear that I am secretly gratifying our adversaries.
For in setting the truth against their vain and empty words, I seem to myself to be wearing
out the patience of my audience before we come to the brunt of the battle. These points,
then, I will leave it to my more learned hearers to dispose of, and proceed with my task. Nor
will I now notice a thing he has said, which, however, is closely connected with our inquiry;
viz. that these things have been so arranged that human thought and conception can claim
no authority over names. But who is there that maintains that what is not seen in its own
subsistence has authority over anything? For only those creatures that are governed by their
own deliberate will are capable of acting with authority. But thought and conception are an
operation of the mind, which depends on the deliberate choice of those who speak, having
no independent subsistence, but subsisting only in the force of the things said. But this, he
says, belongs to God, the Creator of all things, who, by limitations and rules of relation,
operation, and proportion, applies suitable appellations to each of the things named. But
this either is sheer nonsense, or contradicts his previous assertions. For if he now professes
that God affixes names suitable to their subjects, why does he argue, as we have seen that
God bestows lofty names on things without honour, not allowing them a share in the dignity
which their names indicate, and again, that He degrades things of a lofty nature by names
without honour, their nature not being affected by the meanness of their appellations? But
perhaps we are unfair to him in subjecting his senseless collocation of phrases to such accusations
as these. For they are altogether alien to any sense (I do not mean only to a sense in
keeping with reverence), and they will be found to be utterly devoid of reason by all who
understand how to form an accurate judgment in such matters. Since, then, like the fish
called the sea-lung, what we see appears to have bulk and volume, which turns out, however,
to be only viscous matter disgusting to look at, and still more disgusting to handle, I shall
pass over his remarks in silence, deeming that the best answer to his idle effusions. For it
would be better that we should not inquire what law governs “operation,” and “proportion,”
and “relation,” and who it is that prescribes laws to God in respect to rules and modes of
proportion and relation, than that, by busying ourselves in such matters, we should nauseate
our hearers, and digress from more important matters of inquiry.</p>
<p>But I fear that all we shall find in the discourse of Eunomius will turn out to be mere
tumours and sea lungs, so that what has been said must necessarily close our argument, as
his writings will supply no material to work on. For as a smoke or a mist makes the air in
which it resides heavy and thick, and incapacitates the eye for the discharge of its natural

<pb n="537"/>
function, yet does not form itself into so dense a body that he who will may grasp and hold
it in his palms, and offer resistance to its stroke, so if one should say the same of his pompous
piece of writing, the comparison would not be untrue. Much nonsense is worked up in his
tumid and viscous discourse, and to one not gifted with over-much discernment, like a mist
to one viewing it from afar, it seems to have some substance and shape, but if you come up
to it and scrutinize what is said, the theories slip from your hold like smoke, and vanish into
nothing, nor have they any solidity or resistance to oppose to the stroke of your argument.
It is difficult, therefore, to know what to do. For to those who like to complain either alternative
will seem objectionable; whether, leaping over his empty wordiness, as over a ravine,
we direct the course of our argument to the level and open country, against those points
which seem to have any strength against the truth, or form our absurd battle along the whole
line of his inanities. For in the latter case, to those who do not love hard work, our labour,
extending over some thousands of lines to no useful purpose, will be wearisome and unprofitable.
But if we attack those points only which seem to have some force against the truth,
we shall give occasion to our adversaries to accuse us of passing over arguments of theirs
which we are unable to refute. Since, then, two courses are open to us, either to take all their
arguments seriatim, or to run through those only which are more important—the one course
tedious to our hearers, the other liable to be suspected by our assailants—I think it best to
take a middle course, and so, as far as possible, to avoid censure on either hand. What, then,
is our method? After clearing his vain productions, as well as we can, of the rubbish they
have accumulated, we will summarily run through the main points of his argument in such
a way as neither to plunge needlessly into the profundities of his nonsense, nor to leave any
of his statements unexamined. Now his whole treatise is an ambitious attempt to show that
God speaks after the manner of men, and that the Creator of all things gives them suitable
names, indicative of the things themselves. And, therefore, opposing himself to him who
contended that such names are given by that rational nature which we have received from
God, he accuses him of error, and of desertion from his fundamental proposition: and
having brought this charge against him, he uses the following arguments in support of his
position.</p>
<p>Basil, he says, asserts that after we have obtained our first idea of a thing, the more
minute and accurate investigation of the thing under consideration is called conception.
And Eunomius disproves this, as he thinks, by the following argument, that where this first,
and this second notion, i.e. one more minute and accurate than the other, are not found,
the operation which we call thought and conception does not find place. Here, however, he
will be convicted of dishonesty by all who have ears to hear. For it was not of all thought

<pb n="538"/>
and conception that our master (Basil) laid down this definition, but, after making a special
subdivision of the objects of thought and conception (not to encumber the question with
too many words), and having made this part clear, he left men of sense to reason out the
whole from the part for themselves. And as, if any one should say that we get our definition
of an animal from considering a number of animals of different species, he could not be
convicted of missing the truth in making man an instance in point, nor would there be any
need to correct him as deviating from the fact, unless he should give the same definition of
a winged, or four-footed, or aquatic animal as of a man, so, when the points of view from
which we may consider this conception are so many and various, it is no refutation of Basil’s
statement to say that it is improperly so called in one case because there is another species.
Accordingly, even if another species come under consideration, it by no means follows that
the one previously given is erroneously so called. Now if, says he, one of the Apostles or
Prophets could be shown to have used these names of Christ, the falsehood would have
something for its encouragement. To what industrious study of the word of God on the part
of our opponent do not these words bear testimony! None of the Prophets or Apostles has
spoken of our Lord as Bread, or a Stone, or a Fountain, or an Axe, or Light, or a Shepherd!
What, then, saith David, and of whom? “The Lord shepherds me.” “Thou Who shepherdest
Israel, give ear1152.” What difference does it make whether He is spoken of as shepherding,
or as a Shepherd? And again, “With Thee is the Well of life1153.” Does he deny that our
Lord is called a “Well”? And again, “The Stone which the builders rejected1154.” And John,
too,—where, representing our Lord’s power to uproot evil under the name of an axe, he
says, “And now also the Axe is laid to the root of the trees1155”—is he not a weighty and
credible witness to the truth of our words?</p>
<p>And Moses, seeing God in the light, and John calling Him the true Light1156, and in the
same way Paul, when our Lord first appeared to him, and a Light shone round about him,
and afterwards when he heard the words of the Light saying, “I am Jesus, Whom thou persecutest1157,”—
is he not a competent witness? And as regards the name “Bread,” let him
read the Gospel and see how the bread given by Moses, and supplied to Israel from heaven,
was taken by our Lord as a type of Himself: “For Moses gave you not that Bread, but My
Father giveth you the true Bread (meaning Himself) which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life unto the world1158.” But this genuine hearer of the law says that none of the

<pb n="539"/>
Prophets or Apostles has applied these names to Christ. What shall we say, then, of what
follows? “Even if our Lord Himself adopts them, yet, since in the Saviour’s names there is
no first or second, none more minute or accurate than another, for He knows them all at
once with equal accuracy, it is not possible to accommodate his (Basil’s) account of the operation
of conception to any of His names.”</p>
<p>I have deluged my discourse with much nonsense of his, but I trust my hearers will
pardon me for not leaving unnoticed even the most glaring of his inanities; not that we take
pleasure in our author’s indecorum, (for what advantage can we derive from the refutation
of our adversaries’ folly?) but that truth may be advanced by confirmation from whatever
quarter. “Since,” says he, “our Lord applies these appellations to Himself, not deeming any
one of them first, or second, or more minute and accurate than the rest, you cannot say that
these names are the result of conception.” Why, he has forgotten his own object! How comes
he by the knowledge of the words against which he declares war? Our master and guide had
made mention of an example familiar to all, in illustration of the doctrine of conception,
and having explained his meaning by lower illustrations, he lifts the consideration of the
question to higher things. He had said that the word “corn,” regarded by itself, is one thing
only as to substance, but that, as to the various properties we see in it, it varies its appellations,
being called seed, and fruit, and food, and the like. Similarly, says he, our Lord is in respect
to Himself what He is essentially, but when named according to the differences of His operations,
He has not one appellation in all cases, but takes a different name according to each
notion produced in us from the operation. How, then, does what he says disprove our theory
that it is possible for many appellations to be attached with propriety, according to the diversity
of His operations, and His relation to their effects, to the Son of God, though one in
respect of the underlying force, even as corn, though one, has various names apportioned
to it, according to the point of view from which we regard it? How, then, can what is said
be overthrown by our saying that Christ used all these names of Himself? For the question
was not, who ascribed them, but about the meaning of the names, whether they denote es-
sence, or whether they are derived from His operations by the process of conception. But
our shrewd and strong-minded opponent, overturning our theory of conception, which
declares that it is possible to find many appellations for one and the same subject, according
to the significances of its operations, attacks us vigorously, asserting that such names were
not given to our Lord by another. But what has this to do with the case in point? Since these
names are used by our Lord, will he not allow that they are names, or appellations, or words
expressive of ideas? For if he will not admit them to be names, then, in doing away with the
appellations, he does away at the same time with the conception. But if he does not deny
that these words are names, what harm can he do to our doctrine of conception by showing
that such titles were given to our Lord, not by some one else, but by Himself? For what was
said was this, that, as in the instance of corn, our Lord, though substantively One, bears

<pb n="540"/>
epithets suitable to His operations. And as it is admitted that corn has its names by virtue
of our conception of its associations, it was shown that these terms significative of our Lord
are not of His essence, but are formed by the method of conception in our minds respecting
Him. But our antagonist studiously avoids attacking these positions, and maintains that our
Lord received these names from Himself, in the same way as, if one sought for the true interpretation
of the name “Isaac,” whether it means laughter1159, as some say, or something
else, one of Eunomius’ way of thinking should confidently reply that the name was given
to him as a child by his mother: but that, one might say, was not the question, i.e. by whom
the name was given, but what does it mean when translated into our language? And this
being the point of the inquiry, whether our Lord’s various appellations were the result of
conception, instead of being indicative of His essence, he who thus seeks to demonstrate
that they are not so derived because they are used by our Lord Himself,—how can he be
numbered among men of sense, warring as he does against the truth, and equipping himself
with such alliances for the war as serve to show the superior strength of his enemy?</p>
<p>Then going farther, as if his object were thus far attained, he takes up other charges
against us, more difficult, as he thinks, to deal with than the former, and with many preliminary
groans and attempts to prejudice his hearers against us, and to whet their appetite for
his address, accusing us withal of seeking to establish doctrines savouring of blasphemy,
and of ascribing to our own conception names assigned by God (though he nowhere mentions
what assignment he refers to, nor when and where it took place), and, further, of
throwing everything into confusion, and identifying the essence of the Only-begotten with
his operation, without arguing the matter, or showing how we prove the identity of the essence
and the operation, he winds up with the same list of charges, as follows: “And now,
passing beyond this, he (Basil) asperses even the Most High with the vilest blasphemies,
using at the same time broken language, and illustrations wide of the mark.” Now prior to
inquiry, I should like to be told what our language is “broken” from, and what mark it is
“wide of”; not that I want to know, except to show the confusion and obscurity of his address,
which he dins into the ears of the old wives among our men, pluming himself on his nice
phrases, which he mouths out to the admirers of such things, ignorant, as it would seem,
that in the judgment of educated men this address of his will serve only as a memorial of
his own infamy.</p>
<p>But all this is beside our purpose. Would that our charges against him were limited to
this, and that he could be thought to err only in his delivery, and not in matters of faith;
since it would have been of comparatively little importance to him to be praised or blamed
for expressing himself in one style or another. But however that may be, the sequel of his
charges against us contains this in addition: “Considering the case of corn (he says), and of
<note type="footnote">1159 Gen. xviii. 12; xxi. 6.</note>

<pb n="541"/>
our Lord, after exercising his conceptions in various ways upon them, he1160 declares that
even in like manner the most holy essence of God admits of the same variety of conception.”
This is the gravest of his accusations, and it is in prosecuting this that he rehearses those
heavy invectives of his, charging what we have said with blasphemy, absurdity, and so forth.
What, then, is the proof of our blasphemy? “He1161 has mentioned” (says Eunomius) “certain
well-known facts about corn,—perceiving how it grows, and how when ripe it affords food,
growing, multiplying, and being dispensed by certain forces of nature—and, having mentioned
these, he adds that it is only reasonable to suppose that the Only-begotten Son also
admits of different modes of being conceived of1162, by reason of certain differences of operation,
certain analogies, proportions, and relations. For he uses these terms respecting
Him to satiety. And is it not absurd, or rather blasphemous, to compare the Ungenerate
with such objects as these?”—What objects? Why, corn, and God the Only-begotten! You
see his artfulness. He would show that insignificant corn and God the Only-begotten are
equally removed from the dignity of the Ungenerate. And to show that we are not treating
his words unfairly, we may learn his meaning from the very words he has written. “For,” he
asks, “is it not absurd, or rather blasphemous, to compare the Ungenerate with these?” And
in thus speaking, he instances the case of corn and of our Lord as on a level in point of dignity,
thinking it equally absurd to compare God with either. Now every one knows that things
equally distant from a given object are possessed of equality as regards each other, so that
according to our wise theologian the Maker of the worlds, Who holds all nature in His hand,
is shown to be on a par with the most insignificant seed, since He and corn to the same degree
fall short of comparison with God. To such a pitch of blasphemy has he come!</p>
<p>But it is time to examine the argument that leads to this profanity, and see how, as regards
itself, it is logically connected with his whole discourse. For after saying that it is absurd to
compare God with corn and with Christ, he says of God that He is not, like them, subject
to change; but in respect to the Only-begotten, keeping silence on the question whether He
too is not subject to change, and thereby clearly suggesting that He is of lower dignity, in
that we cannot compare Him, any more than we can compare corn, with God, he breaks
off his discourse without using any argument to prove that the Son of God cannot be compared
with the Father, as though our knowledge of the grain were sufficient to establish the
<note type="footnote">1160 he,i.e. Basil. “God’s nature can be looked at in as many aspects as corn can (i.e. in its growth, fructification,
distribution,U+0026c.).”</note>
<note type="footnote">1161 He,i.e. Basil. The words ὁ Εὐνόμιος, here are the additions of a copyist who did not understand that
εἶπεν referred to Basil, or else φησὶν must be read with them. Certainly ταῦτα εἰπὼν below must refer to the

<pb n="542"/>
inferiority of the Son in comparison with the Father. But he discourses of the indestructibility
of the Father, as not in actuality attaching to the Son. But if the True Life is an actuality,
actuating itself, and if to live everlastingly means the same thing as never to be dissolved in
destruction, I for myself do not as yet assent to his argument, but will reserve myself for a
more proper occasion. That, however, there is but one single notion in indestructibility1163,
considered in reference to the Father and to the Son alike, and that the indestructibility of
the Father differs in no respect from that of the Son, no difference as to indestructibility
being observable either in remission and intension, or in any other phase of the process of
destruction, this, I say, it is seasonable both now and at all times to assert, so as to preclude
the doctrine that in respect of indestructibility the Son has no communion with the Father.
For as this indestructibility is understood in respect of the Father, so also it is not to be disputed
in respect of the Son. For to be incapable of dissolution means nearly, or rather precisely,
the same thing in regard to whatever subject it is attributed to. What, then, induces
him to assert, that only to the Ungenerate Deity does it belong to have this indestructibility
not attaching to Him by reason of any energy, as though he would thereby show a difference
between the Father and the Son? For if he supposes his own created God destructible, he
well shows the essential divergence of natures by the difference between the destructible
and the indestructible. But if neither is subject to destruction,—and no degrees are to be
found in pure indestructibility,—how does he show that the Father cannot be compared
with the Only-begotten Son, or what is meant by saying that indestructibility is not witnessed
in the Father by reason of any energy? But he reveals his purpose in what follows. It is not
because of His operations or energies, he says, that He is ungenerate and indestructible, but
because He is Father and Creator. And here I must ask my hearers to give me their closest
attention. How can he think the creative power of God and His Fatherhood identical in
meaning? For he defines each alike as an energy, plainly and expressly affirming, “God is
not indestructible by reason of His energy, though He is called Father and Creator by reason
of energies.” If, then, it is the same thing to call Him Father and Creator of the world because
either name is due to an energy as its cause, the results of His energies must be homogeneous,
inasmuch as it is through an energy, that they both exist. But to what blasphemy this logically
tends is clear to every one who can draw a conclusion. For myself, I should like to add my
own deductions to my disquisition. It is impossible that an energy or operation productive
<note type="footnote">1163 Indestructibility. Such terms (“not-composite,” “indivisible,” “imperishable”) were the inheritance which
Christian controversy received from the former struggle with Stoicism. In the hands of Origen, they had been
aimed at the Stoic doctrine of the Deity as that of corporeal Spirit, which does not perish, only because there is
no cause sufficient. “If one does not see the consequences of such an assertion, one ought to blush” (in Johann.
xiii. 21). The consequences of course are that God, the Word, and our souls, made in His image, are all perishable;
for all body, in that it is matter, is by the Stoic assumption, liable to change.</note>

<pb n="543"/>
of a result should subsist of itself without there being something to set the energy in motion;
as we say that a smith operates or works, but that the material on which his art is exercised
is operated upon, or wrought. These faculties, therefore, that of operating, and that of being
operated upon, must needs stand in a certain relation to each other, so that if one be removed,
the remaining one cannot subsist of itself. For where there is nothing operated upon there
can be nothing operating. What, then, does this prove? If the energy which is productive of
anything does not subsist of itself, there being nothing for it to operate upon, and if the
Father, as they affirm, is nothing but an energy, the Only-begotten Son is thereby shown to
be capable of being acted upon, in other words, moulded in accordance with the motive
energy that gives Him His subsistence. For as we say that the Creator of the world, by laying
down some yielding material, capable of being acted upon, gave His creative being a field
for its exercise, in the case of things sensible skilfully investing the subject with various and
multiform qualities for production, but in the case of intellectual essences giving shape to
the subject in another way, not by qualities, but by impulses of choice, so, if any one define
the Fatherhood of God as an energy, he cannot otherwise indicate the subsistence of the
Son than by comparing it with some material acted upon and wrought to completion. For
if it could not be operated upon, it would of necessity offer resistance to the operator: whose
energy being thus hindered, no result would be produced. Either, then, they must make the
essence of the Only-begotten subject to be acted upon, that the energy may have something
to work upon, or, if they shrink from this conclusion, on account of its manifest impiety,
they are driven to the conclusion that it has no existence at all. For what is naturally incapable
of being acted upon, cannot itself admit the creative energy. He, then, who defines the Son
as the effect of an energy, defines Him as one of those things which are subject to be acted
upon, and which are produced by an energy. Or, if he deny such susceptibility, he must at
the same time deny His existence. But since impiety is involved in either alternative of the
dilemma, that of asserting His non-existence, and that of regarding Him as capable of being
acted upon, the truth is made manifest, being brought to light by the removal of these absurdities.
For if He verily exists, and is not subject to be acted upon, it is plain that He is not
the result of an energy, but is proved to be very God of very God the Father, without liability
to be acted upon, beaming from Him and shining forth from everlasting.</p>
<p>But in His very essence, he says, God is indestructible. Well, what other conceivable attribute
of God does not attach to the very essence of the Son, as justice, goodness, eternity,
incapacity for evil, infinite perfection in all conceivable goodness? Is there one who will
venture to say that any of the virtues in the Divine nature are acquired, or to deny that all
good whatsoever springs from and is seen in it? “For whatsoever is good is from Him, and
whatsoever is lovely is from Him1164.” But he appends to this, that He is in His very essence
<note type="footnote">1164 Zech. ix. 17 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="544"/>
ungenerate too. Well, if he means by this that the Father’s essence is ungenerate, I agree
with what is said, and do not oppose his doctrine: for not one of the orthodox maintains
that the Father of the Only-begotten is Himself begotten. But if, while the form of his expression
indicates only this, he maintains that the ungeneracy itself is the essence, I say that we
ought not to leave such a position unexamined, but expose his attempt to gain the assent of
the unwary to his blasphemy.</p>
<p>Now that the idea1165 of ungeneracy and the belief in the Divine essence are quite different
things may be seen by what he himself has put forward. God, he says, is indestructible
and ungenerate by His very essence, as being unmixed and pure from all diversity and difference.
This he says of God, Whose essence he declares to be indestructibility and ungeneracy.
There are three names, then, that he applies to God, being, indestructibility, ungeneracy.
If the idea of these three words in respect of God is one, it follows that the Godhead
and these three are identical. Just as if any one, wanting to describe a man, should say that
he was a rational, risible, and broad-nailed creature; whereupon, because there is no essential
variation from these in the individuals, we say that the terms are equivalent to each other,
and that the three things seen in the subject are one thing, viz. the humanity described by
these names. If, then, Godhead means this, ungeneracy, indestructibility, being, by doing
away with one of these he necessarily does away with the Godhead. For just as we should
say that a creature which was neither rational nor risible was not man either, so in the case
of these three terms (ungeneracy, indestructibility, being), if the Godhead is described by
these, should one of the three be absent, its absence destroys the definition of Godhead. Let
him tell us, then, in reply, what opinion he holds of God the Only-begotten. Does he think
Him generate or ungenerate? Of course he must say generate, unless he is to contradict
himself. If, then, being and indestructibility are equivalent to ungeneracy, and by all of these
Godhead is denoted, to Whom ungeneracy is wanting, to Him being and indestructibility
must needs be wanting also, and in that case the Godhead also must necessarily be taken
away. And thus his blasphemous logic brings him to a twofold conclusion. For if being, and
indestructibility, and ungeneracy are applied to God in the same sense, our new God-maker
is clearly convicted of regarding the Son created by Him as destructible, by his not regarding
Him as ungenerate, and not only so, but altogether without being, through his inability to
see Him in the Godhead, as one in whom ungeneracy and indestructibility are not found,
since he takes the ungeneracy and indestructibility to be identical with the being. But since
in this there is manifest perdition, let some one counsel these unhappy folk to turn to the
only course which is left them, and, instead of setting themselves in open opposition to the
truth, to allow that each of these terms has its own proper signification, such as may be seen
<note type="footnote">1165 τὸ νόημα. There is a lacuna in the Paris Editt., beginning here, and extending to “ungenerate,” just below.
Oehler’s Codices have supplied it.</note>

<pb n="545"/>
still better from their contraries. For we find ungenerate set against generate, and we understand
the indestructible by its opposition to the destructible, and being by contrast with that
which has no subsistence. For as that which was not generated is called ungenerate, and
that which is not destructible is called indestructible, so that which is not non-existent we
call being, and, conversely, as we do not call the generate ungenerate, nor the destructible
indestructible, so that which is non-existent we do not call being. Being, then, is discernible
in the being this or that, goodness or indestructibility in the being of this or of that kind,
generacy or ungeneracy in the manner of the being. And thus the ideas of being, manner,
and quality are distinct from each other.</p>
<p>But it will be well, I think, to pass over his nauseating observations (for such we must
term his senseless attacks on the method of conception), and dwell more pleasurably on the
subject matter of our thought. For all the venom that our disputant has disgorged with the
view of overthrowing our Master’s speculations in regard to conception, is not of such a
kind as to be dangerous to those who come in its way, however stupid they may be and liable
to be imposed on. For who is so devoid of understanding as to think that there is anything
in what Eunomius says, or to see any ingenuity in his artifices against the truth when he
takes our Master’s reference to corn (which he meant simply by way of illustration, thereby
providing his hearers with a sort of method and introduction to the study of higher instances),
and applies it literally to the Lord of all? To think of his assertion that the most becoming
cause for God’s begetting the Son was His sovereign authority and power, which may be
said not only in regard to the universe and its elements, but in regard to beasts and creeping
things; and of our reverend theologian teaching that the same is becoming in our conception
of God the Only-begotten—or again, of his saying that God was called ungenerate, or
Father, or any other name, even before the existence of creatures to call Him such, as being
afraid lest, His name not being uttered among creatures as yet unborn, He should be ignorant
or forgetful of Himself, through ignorance of His own nature because of His name being
unspoken! To think, again, of the insolence of his attack upon our teaching; what acrimony,
what subtlety does he display, while attempting to establish the absurdity of what he (Basil)
said, namely that He Who was in a manner the Father before all worlds and time, and all
sensitive and intellectual nature, must somehow wait for man’s creation in order to be named
by means of man’s conception, not having been so named, either by the Son or by any of
the intelligent beings of His creation! Why no one, I imagine, can be so densely stupid as
to be ignorant that God the Only-begotten, Who is in the Father1166, and Who seeth the
Father in Himself, is in no need of any name or title to make Him known, nor is the mystery
of the Holy Spirit, Who searcheth out the deep things of God1167, brought to our knowledge
<note type="footnote">1166 S. John xiv. 9</note>
<note type="footnote">1167 1 Cor. ii. 10.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
by a nominal appellation, nor can the incorporeal nature of supramundane powers name
God by voice and tongue. For, in the case of immaterial intellectual nature, the mental energy
is speech which has no need of material instruments of communication. For even in the
case of human beings, we should have no need of using words and names if we could otherwise
inform each other of our pure mental feelings and impulses. But (as things are), inasmuch
as the thoughts which arise in us are incapable of being so revealed, because our nature
is encumbered with its fleshly surrounding, we are obliged to express to each other what
goes on in our minds by giving things their respective names, as signs of their meaning.</p>
<p>But if it were in any way possible by some other means to lay bare the movements of
thought, abandoning the formal instrumentality of words, we should converse with one
another more lucidly and clearly, revealing by the mere action of thought the essential nature
of the things which are under consideration. But now, by reason of our inability to do so,
we have given things their special names, calling one Heaven, another Earth, and so on, and
as each is related to each, and acts or suffers, we have marked them by distinctive names,
so that our thoughts in regard to them may not remain uncommunicated and unknown.
But supramundane and immaterial nature being free and independent of bodily envelopment,
requires no words or names either for itself or for that which is above it, but whatever utter-
ance on the part of such intellectual nature is recorded in Holy Writ is given for the sake of
the hearers, who would be unable otherwise to learn what is to be set forth, if it were not
communicated to them by voice and word. And if David in the spirit speaks of something
being said by the Lord to the Lord1168, it is David himself who is the speaker, being unable
otherwise to make known to us the teaching of what is meant except by interpreting by
voice and word his own knowledge of the mysteries given him by Divine inspiration.</p>
<p>All his argument, then, in opposition to the doctrine of conception I think it best to
pass over, though he charge with madness those who think that the name of God, as used
by mankind to indicate the Supreme Being, is the result of this conception. For what he is
thinking of when he considers himself bound to revile that doctrine, all who will may learn
from his own words. What opinion we ourselves hold on the use of words we have already
stated, viz. that, things being as they are in regard to their nature, the rational faculty implanted
in our nature by God invented words indicative of those actual things. And if any
one ascribe their origin to the Giver of the faculty, we would not contradict him, for we too
maintain that motion, and sight, and the rest of the operations carried on by the senses are
effected by Him Who endowed us with such faculties. So, then, the cause of our naming
God, Who is by His nature what He is, is referable by common consent to Himself, but the
liberty of naming all things that we conceive of in one way or another lies in that thing in
our nature, which, whether a man wish to call it conception or something else, we are quite
<note type="footnote">1168 Ps. cx. 1.</note>

<pb n="547"/>
indifferent. And there is this one sure evidence in our favour, that the Divine Being is not
named alike by all, but that each interprets his idea as he thinks best. Passing over, then, in
silence his rubbishy twaddle about conception, let us hold to our tenets, and simply note
by the way some of the observations that occur in the midst of his empty speeches, where
he pretends that God, seating Himself by our first parents, like some pedagogue or grammarian,
gave them a lesson in words and names; wherein he says that they who were first
formed by God, or those who were born from them in continuous succession, unless they
had been taught how each several thing should be called and named, would have lived together
in dumbness and silence, and would have been unequal to the discharge of any of
the serviceable functions of life, the meaning of each being uncertain through lack of interpreters,—
verbs forsooth, and nouns. Such is the infatuation of this writer; he thinks the
faculty implanted in our nature by God insufficient for any method of reasoning, and that
unless it be taught each thing severally, like those who are taught Hebrew or Latin word by
word, one must be ignorant of the nature of the things, having no discernment of fire, or
water, or air, or anything else, unless one have acquired the knowledge of them by the names
that they bear. But we maintain that He Who made all things in His wisdom, and Who
moulded this living rational creature, by the simple fact of His implanting reason in his
nature, endowed him with all his rational faculties. And as naturally possessing our faculties
of perception by the gift of Him Who fashioned the eye and planted the ear, we can of
ourselves employ them for their natural objects, and have no need of any one to name the
colours, for instance, of which the eye takes cognizance, for the eye is competent to inform
itself in such matters; nor do we need another to make us acquainted with the things which
we perceive by hearing, or taste, or touch, possessing as we do in ourselves the means of
discerning all of which our perception informs us. And so, again, we maintain that the intellectual
faculty, made as it was originally by God, acts thenceforward by itself when it looks
out upon realities, and that there be no confusion in its knowledge, affixes some verbal note
to each several thing as a stamp to indicate its meaning. Great Moses himself confirms this
doctrine when he says1169 that names were assigned by Adam to the brute creation, recording
the fact in these words: “And out of the ground God formed every beast of the field, and
every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them, and
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave
names to all cattle, and to all the beasts of the field.”</p>
<p>But, like some viscous and sticky clay, the nonsense he has concocted in contravention
of our teaching of conception seems to hold us back, and prevent us from applying ourselves
to more important matters. For how can one pass over his solemn and profound philosophy,
as when he says that God’s greatness is seen not only in the works of His hands, but that
<note type="footnote">1169 Gen. ii. 19, 20.</note>

<pb n="548"/>
His wisdom is displayed in their names also, adapted as they are with such peculiar fitness
to the nature of each work of His creation1170? Having perchance fallen in with Plato’s
Cratylus, or hearing from some one who had met with it, by reason, I suppose, of his own
poverty of ideas, he attached that nonsense patchwise to his own, acting like those who get
their bread by begging. For just as they, receiving some trifle from each who bestows it on
them, collect their bread from many and various sources, so the discourse of Eunomius, by
reason of his scanty store of the true bread, assiduously collects scraps of phrases and notions
from all quarters. And thus, being struck by the beauty of the Platonic style, he thinks it not
unseemly to make Plato’s theory a doctrine of the Church. For by how many appellations,
say, is the created firmament called according to the varieties of language? For we call it
Heaven, the Hebrew calls it Samaim, the Roman coelum, other names are given to it by the
Syrian, the Mede, the Cappadocian, the African, the Scythian, the Thracian the Egyptian:
nor would it be easy to enumerate the multiplicity of names which are applied to Heaven
<note type="footnote">1170 Compare with this view of Eunomius on the sacredness of names, this striking passage from Origen (c.
Cels. v. 43). “We hold, then, that the origin of names is not to be found in any formal agreements on the part
of those who gave them, as Aristotle thinks. Human language, in fact, did not have its beginning from man. Any
one can see this who reflects upon the real nature of the incantations which in the different languages are associated
with the patriarchal names of those languages. The names which have their native power in such and
such a language cease to have this influence of their peculiar sound when they are changed into another language.
This has been often observed in the names given even to living men: one who from his birth has been called so
and so in Greek will never, if we change his name into Egyptian or Roman, be made to feel or act as he can when
called by the first name given.…If this is true in the case of names given to men, what are we to think of the
names connected in some way or other with the Deity? For instance, there must be some change in translating
Abraham’s name into Greek: some new expression given to ‘Isaac,’ and ‘Jacob’: and, while he who repeats the
incantation or the oath names the ‘God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,’ he produces those particular effects
by the mere force and working of those names: because the dæmons are mustered by him who utters them: but
if on the other hand he says, ‘God of the chosen Father of the Crowd,’ ‘of the Laughter,’ ‘of the Supplanter,’ he
can do nothing with the names so expressed, any more than with any other powerless instrument.…We can say
the same of ‘Sabaoth,’ which is used in many exorcisms: if we change it to ‘Lord of Powers,’ or, ‘Lord of Hosts,’
or, ‘Almighty,’ we can do nothing …”—and (46), “This, too, is the reason why we ourselves prefer any degradation
to that of owning Zeus to be Deity. We cannot conceive of Zeus as the same as Sabaoth: or as Divine in any of
all possible meanings.…If the Egyptians offer us ‘Ammon,’ or death, we shall take the latter, rather than pronounce
the divinity of ‘Ammon.’ The Scythians may tell us that their Papoeus is the God of the Universe, we shall not
listen: we firmly believe in the God of the Universe, but we must not call him Papoeus, making that a name for
absolute Deity, as the Being who occupies the desert, the nation, and the language of the Scythians would desire:
although, indeed, it cannot be sin for any to use the appellation of the Deity in his own mother tongue, whether
it be the Scythian way or the Egyptian.”</note>

<pb n="549"/>
and other objects by the different nations that employ them. Which of these, then, tell me,
is the appropriate word wherein the great wisdom of God is manifested? If you prefer the
Greek to the rest, the Egyptian haply will confront you with his own. And if you give the
first place to the Hebrew, there is the Syrian to claim precedence for his own word, nor will
the Roman yield the supremacy, nor the Mede allow himself to be outdone; while of the
other nations each will claim the prize. What, then, will be the fate of his dogma when torn
to pieces by the claimants for so many different languages? But by these, says he, as by laws
publicly promulgated, it is shown that God made names exactly suited to the nature of the
things which they represent. What a grand doctrine! What grand views our theologian allows
to the Divine teachings, such indeed as men do not grudge even to bathing-attendants! For
we allow them to give names to the operations they engage in, and yet no one invests them
with Divine honours for the invention of such names as foot-baths, depilatories, towels,
and the like—words which appropriately designate the articles in question.</p>
<p>But I will pass over both this and their reading of Epicurus’ nature-system, which he
says is equivalent to our conception, maintaining that the doctrine of atoms and empty
space, and the fortuitous generation of things, is akin to what we mean by conception. What
an understanding of Epicurus! If we ascribe words expressive of things to the logical faculty
in our nature, we thereby stand convicted of holding the Epicurean doctrine of indivisible
bodies, and combinations of atoms, and the collision and rebound of particles, and so on.
I say nothing of Aristotle, whom he takes as his own patron, and the ally of his system, whose
opinion, he says, in his subsequent remarks, coincides with our views about conception.
For he says that that philosopher taught that Providence does not extend through all nature,
nor penetrate into the region of terrestrial things, and this, Eunomius contends, corresponds
to our discoveries in the field of conception. Such is his idea of determining a doctrine with
accuracy! But he goes on to say that we must either deny the creation of things to God, or,
if we concede it, we must not deprive Him of the imposition of names. And yet even in respect
to the brute creation, as we have said already, we are taught the very opposite (of both these
alternatives) by Holy Scripture—that neither did Adam make the animals, nor did God
name them, but the creation was the work of God, and the naming of the things created was
the work of man, as Moses has recorded. Then in his own speech he gives us an encomium
of speech in general (as though some one wished to disparage it), and after his eminently
abusive and bombastic conglomeration of words, he says that, by a law and rule of His
providence, God has combined the transmission of words with our knowledge and use of
things necessary for our service; and after pouring forth twaddle of this kind in the profundity
of his slumbers, he passes on in his discourse to his irresistible and unanswerable argument.
I will not state it in so many words, but simply give the drift of it. We are not, he says, to
ascribe the invention of words to poets, who are much mistaken in their notions of God.
What a generous concession does he make to God in investing Him with the inventions of

<pb n="550"/>
the poetic faculty, so that God may thereby seem to men more sublime and august, when
the disciples of Eunomius believe that such expressions as those used by Homer for “sideways,”
“rang out,” “aside,” “mix1171,” “clung to his hand,” “hissed,” “thumped,” “rattled,”
“clashed,” “rang terribly,” “twanged,” “shouted,” “pondered,” and many others, are not used
by poets by a certain arbitrary licence, but that they introduce them into their poems by
some mysterious initiation from God! Let this, too, be passed over, and withal that clever
and irresistible attempt, that it is not in our power to quote Scriptural instances of holy men
who have invented new terms. Now if human nature had been imperfect up to the time of
such men’s appearance, and not as yet completed by the gift of reason, it would have been
well for them to seek that the deficiency might be supplied. But if from the very first man’s
nature existed self-sufficing and complete for all purposes of reason and thought, why should
any one, in order to establish this doctrine of conception, humour them so far as to seek for
instances where holy men initiated sounds or names? Or, if we cannot adduce any instances,
why should any one regard it as a sufficient proof that such and such syllables and words
were appointed by God Himself?</p>
<p>But, says he, since God condescends to commune with His servants, we may consequently
suppose that from the very beginning He enacted words appropriate to things. What, then,
is our answer? We account for God’s willingness to admit men to communion with Himself
by His love towards mankind. But since that which is by nature finite cannot rise above its
prescribed limits, or lay hold of the superior nature of the Most High, on this account He,
bringing His power, so full of love for humanity, down to the level of human weakness, so
far as it was possible for us to receive it, bestowed on us this helpful gift of grace. For as by
Divine dispensation the sun, tempering the intensity of his full beams with the intervening
air, pours down light as well as heat on those who receive his rays, being himself unapproachable
by reason of the weakness of our nature, so the Divine power, after the manner of the
illustration I have used, though exalted far above our nature and inaccessible to all approach,
like a tender mother who joins in the inarticulate utterances of her babe, gives to our human
nature what it is capable of receiving; and thus in the various manifestations of God to man
He both adapts Himself to man and speaks in human language, and assumes wrath, and
pity, and such-like emotions, so that through feelings corresponding to our own our infantile
life might be led as by hand, and lay hold of the Divine nature by means of the words which
His foresight has given. For that it is irreverent to imagine that God is subject to any passion
such as we see in respect to pleasure, or pity, or anger, no one will deny who has thought at
all about the truth of things. And yet the Lord is said to take pleasure in His servants, and

<pb n="551"/>
to be angry with the backsliding people, and, again, to have mercy on whom He will have
mercy, and to show compassion—the word teaching us in each of these expressions that
God’s providence helps our infirmity by using our own idioms of speech, so that such as
are inclined to sin may be restrained from committing it by fear of punishment, and that
those who are overtaken by it may not despair of return by the way of repentance when they
see God’s mercy, while those who are walking uprightly and strictly may yet more adorn
their life with virtue, as knowing that by their own life they rejoice Him Whose eyes are
over the righteous. But just as we cannot call a man deaf who converses with a deaf man by
means of signs,—his only way of hearing,—so we must not suppose speech in God because
of His employing it by way of accommodation in addressing man. For we ourselves are accustomed
to direct brute beasts by clucking and whistling and the like, and yet this, by which
we reach their ears, is not our language, but we use our natural speech in talking to one another,
while, in regard to cattle, some suitable noise or sound accompanied with gesture is
sufficient for all purposes of communication.</p>
<p>But our pious opponent will not allow of God’s using our language, because of our
proneness to evil, shutting his eyes (good man!) to the fact that for our sakes He did not
refuse to be made sin and a curse. Such is the superabundance of His love for man, that He
voluntarily came to prove not only our good, but our evil. And if He was partaker in our
evil, why should He refuse to be partaker in speech, the noblest of our gifts? But he advances
David in his support, and declares that he said that names were imposed on things by God,
because it is thus written, “He telleth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their
names1172.” But I think it must be obvious to every man of sense that what is thus said of
the stars has nothing whatever to do with the subject. Since, however, it is not improbable
that some may unwarily give their assent to his statement, I will briefly discuss the point.
Holy Scripture oftentimes is wont to attribute expressions to God such that they seem quite
accordant with our own, e.g. “The Lord was wroth, and it repented Him because of their
sins1173”; and again, “He repented that He had anointed Saul king1174”; and again, “The
Lord awaked as one out of sleep1175”; and besides this, it makes mention of His sitting, and
standing, and moving, and the like, which are not as a fact connected with God, but are not
without their use as an accommodation to those who are under teaching. For in the case of
the too unbridled, a show of anger restrains them by fear. And to those who need the
medicine of repentance, it says that the Lord repenteth along with them of the evil, and
those who grow insolent through prosperity it warns, by God’s repentance in respect to

Saul, that their good fortune is no certain possession, though it seem to come from God.
To those who are not engulfed by their sinful fall, but who have risen from a life of vanity
as from sleep, it says that God arises out of sleep. To those who steadfastly take their stand
upon righteousness,—that He stands. To those who are seated in righteousness,—that He
sits. And again, in the case of those who have moved from their steadfastness in righteousness,—
that He moves or walks; as, in the case of Adam, the sacred history records God’s
walking in the garden in the cool of the day1176, signifying thereby the fall of the first man
into darkness, and, by the moving, his weakness and instability in regard to righteousness.</p>
<p>But most people, perhaps, will think this too far removed from the scope of our present
inquiry. This, however, no one will regard as out of keeping with our subject; the fact that
many think that what is incomprehensible to themselves is equally incomprehensible to
God, and that whatever escapes their own cognizance is also beyond the power of His. Now
since we make number the measure of quantity, and number is nothing else than a combination
of units growing into multitude in a complex way (for the decad is a unit brought to
that value by the composition of units, and again the hundred is a unit composed of decads,
and in like manner the thousand is another unit, and so in due proportion the myriad is
another by a multiplication, the one being made up to its value by thousands, the other by
hundreds, by assigning all which to their underlying class we make signs of the quantity of
the things numbered), accordingly, in order that we may be taught by Holy Scripture that
nothing is unknown to God, it tells us that the multitude of the stars is numbered by Him,
not that their numbering takes place as I have described, (for who is so simple as to think
that God takes knowledge of things by odd and even, and that by putting units together He
makes up the total of the collective quantity?) but, since in our own case the exact knowledge
of quantity is obtained by number, in order, I say, that we might be taught in respect to God
that all things are comprehended by the knowledge of His wisdom, and that nothing escapes
His minute cognizance, on this account it represents God as “numbering the stars,” counselling
us by these words to understand this, viz. that we must not imagine God to take note
of things by the measure of human knowledge, but that all things, however incomprehensible
and above human understanding, are embraced by the knowledge of the wisdom of God.
For as the stars on account of their multitude escape numbering, as far as our human conception
is concerned, Holy Scripture, teaching the whole from the part, in saying that they
are numbered by God attests that not one of the things unknown to us escapes the knowledge
of God. And therefore it says, “Who telleth the multitude of the stars,” of course not meaning
that He did not know their number beforehand; for how should He be ignorant of what He
Himself created, seeing that the Ruler of the Universe could not be ignorant of that which
is comprehended in His power; which includes the worlds in its embrace? Why, then, should
<note type="footnote">1176 Gen. iii. 8.</note>

<pb n="553"/>
He number what He knows? For to measure quantity by number is the part of those who
want information. But He Who knew all things before they were created needs not number
as His informant. But when David says that He “numbers the stars,” it is evident that the
Scripture descends to such language in accordance with our understanding, to teach us
emblematically that the things which we know not are accurately known to God. As, then,
He is said to number, though needing no arithmetical process to arrive at the knowledge of
things created, so also the Prophet tells us that He calleth them all by their names, not
meaning, I imagine, that He does so by any vocal utterance. For verily such language would
result in a conception strangely unworthy of God, if it meant that these names in common
use among ourselves were applied to the stars by God. For, should any one allow that these
were so applied by God, it must follow that the names of the idol gods of Greece were applied
by Him also to the stars, and we must regard as true all the tales from mythological history
that are told about those starry names, as though God Himself sanctioned their utterance.
Thus the distribution among the Greek idols of the seven planets contained in the heavens
will exempt from blame those who have erred in respect to them, if men be persuaded that
such an arrangement was God’s. Thus the fables of Orion and the Scorpion will be believed,
and the legends respecting the ship Argo, and the Swan, and the Eagle, and the Dog, and
the mythical story of Ariadne’s crown. Moreover it will pave the way for supposing God to
be the inventor of the names in the zodiacal circle, devised after some fancied resemblance
in the constellations, if Eunomius is right in supposing that David said that these names
were given them by God.</p>
<p>Since, then, it is monstrous to regard God as the inventor of such names, lest the names
even of these idol gods should seem to have had their origin from God, it will be well not
to receive what has been said without inquiry, but to get to the meaning in this case also
after the analogy of those things of which number informs us. Well, since it attests the accuracy
of our knowledge, when we call one familiar to us by his name, we are here taught
that He Who embraces the Universe in His knowledge not only comprehends the total of
the aggregate quantity, but has an exact knowledge of the units also that compose it. And
therefore the Scripture says not only that He “telleth the number of the stars,” but that “He
calleth them all by their names,” which means that His accurate knowledge extends to the
minutest of them, and that He knows each particular respecting them, just as a man knows
one who is familiar to him by name. And if any one say that the names given to the stars by
God are different ones, unknown to human language, he wanders far away from the truth.
For if there were other names of stars, Holy Scripture would not have made mention of
those which are in common use among the Greeks, Esaias saying1177, “Which maketh the
<note type="footnote">1177 The words here attributed to Isaiah are found in Job ix. 9 (LXX.): and Orion in Isaiah xiii. 10 (LXX.),
with “the stars of heaven;” and in Amos v. 8 with “the seven stars.”</note>

<pb n="554"/>
Pleiads, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the Chambers of the South,” and Job making
mention of Orion and Aseroth1178; so that from this it is clear that Holy Scripture employs
for our instruction such words as are in common use. Thus we hear in Job of Amalthea’s
horn1179, and in Esaias of the Sirens1180, the former thus naming plenty after the conceit
of the Greeks, the latter representing the pleasure derived from hearing, by the figure of the
Sirens. As, then, in these cases the inspired word has made use of names drawn from
mythological fables, with a view to the advantage of the hearers, so here it freely makes use
of the appellations given to the stars by human fancy, teaching us that all things whatsoever
that are named among men have their origin from God—the things, not their names. For
it does not say Who nameth, but “Who maketh Pleiad, and Hesperus, and Arcturus.” I
think, then, it has been sufficiently shown in what I have said that David supports our
opinion, in teaching us by this utterance, not that God gives the stars their names, but that
He has an exact knowledge of them, after the fashion of men, who have the most certain
knowledge of those whom they are able, through long familiarity, to call by their names.</p>
<p>And if we set forth the opinion of most commentators on these words of the Psalmist,
that of Eunomius regarding them will be still more convicted of foolishness. For those who
have most carefully searched out the sense of the inspired Scripture, declare that not all the
works of creation are worthy of the Divine reckoning. For in the Gospel narratives of feeding
the multitudes in the wilderness, women and children are not thought worthy of enumeration.
And in the account of the Exodus of the children of Israel, those only are enumerated
in the roll who were of age to bear arms against their enemies, and to do deeds of valour.
For not all names of things are fit to be pronounced by the Divine lips, but the enumeration

is only for that which is pure and heavenly, which, by the loftiness of its state remaining
pure from all admixture with darkness, is called a star, and the naming is only for that which,
for the same reason, is worthy to be registered in the Divine tablets. For of His adversaries
He says, “I will not take up their names into my lips1181.”</p>
<p>But the names which the Lord gives to such stars we may plainly learn from the
prophecy of Esaias, which says, “I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine1182.” So that
if a man makes himself God’s possession, his act becomes his name. But be this as the
reader pleases. Eunomius, however, adds to his previous statement that the beginnings of
creation testify to the fact, that names were given by God to the things which He created;
but I think that it would be superfluous to repeat what I have already sufficiently set forth
as the result of my investigations; and he may put his own arbitrary interpretation on the
word Adam, which, the Apostle tells us, points prophetically to Christ1183. For no one can
be so infatuated, when Paul, by the power of the Spirit, has revealed to us the hidden mysteries,
as to count Eunomius a more trustworthy interpreter of Divine things—a man who
openly impugns the words of the inspired testimony, and who by his false interpretation of
the word would fain prove that the various kinds of animals were not named by Adam. We
shall do well, also, to pass over his insolent expressions, and tasteless vulgarity, and foul and
disgusting tongue, with its accustomed fluency going on about our Master as “a sower of
tares,” and about “a deceptive show1184 of grain, and the blight of Valentinus, and his grain
piled in our Master’s mind”: and we will veil in silence the rest of his unsavoury talk as we
veil putrefying corpses in the ground, that the stench may not prove injurious to many.
Rather let us proceed to what remains for us to say. For once more he adduces a dictum of
our Master1185, to this effect. “We call God indestructible and ungenerate, applying these
words from different points of view. For when we look to the ages that are past, finding the
life of God transcending all limitation, we call Him ungenerate. But when we turn our
thoughts to the ages that are yet to come, Him Who is infinite, illimitable, and without end,

accustomed to repeat the same thoughts in different terms without ever arriving at a clear explanation of what
he had proposed to himself. Of this his seven books on the Apostle’s Epistle to the Romans, on which he expended
a quantity of vain labour, is a remarkable proof.” But see c. Eunom. II. p. 107.</note>

we call indestructible. As, then, that which has no end of life is indestructible, so that which
has no beginning we call ungenerate, representing things so by the faculty of conception.”</p>
<p>I will pass over, then, the abuse with which he has prefaced his discussion of these
matters, as when he uses such terms as “alteration of seed,” and “teacher of sowing,” and
“illogical censure,” and whatever other aspersions he ventures on with his foul tongue. Let
us rather turn to the point which he tries to establish by his calumnious accusation. He
promises to convict us of saying that God is not by His nature indestructible. But we hold
only such things foreign to His nature as may be added to or subtracted from it. But, in the
case of things without which the subject is incapable of being conceived by the mind, how
can any one be open to the charge of separating His nature from itself? If, then, the indestructibility
which we ascribe to God were adventitious, and did not always belong to Him,
or might cease to belong to Him, he might be justified in his calumnious attack. But if it is
always the same, and our contention is, that God is always what He is, and that He receives
nothing by way of increase or addition of properties, but continues always in whatsoever is
conceived and called good, why should we be slanderously accused of not ascribing indestructibility
to Him as of His essential nature? But he pretends that he grounds his accusation
on the words of Basil which I have already quoted, as though we bestowed indestructibility
on God by reference to the ages. Now if our statement were put forward by ourselves, our
defence might perhaps seem open to suspicion, as if we now wanted to amend or justify any
questionable expressions of ours. But since our statements are taken from the lips of an adversary,
what stronger demonstration could we have of their truth than the evidence of our
opponents themselves? How is it, then, with the statement which Eunomius lays hold of
with a view to our prejudice? When, he says, we turn our thoughts to the ages that are yet
to be, we speak of the infinite, and illimitable, and unending, as indestructible. Does Eunomius
count such ascription as identical with bestowing? Yet who is such a stranger to existing
usage as to be ignorant of the proper meaning of these expressions? For that man bestows
who possesses something which another has not, while that man ascribes who designates
with a name what another has. How is it, then, that our instructor in truth is not ashamed
of his plainly calumnious impeachment? But as those who, from some disease, are bereft of
sight, are unseemly in their behaviour before the eyes of the seeing, supposing that what is
not seen by themselves is a thing unobserved also by those whose sight is unimpaired, just
such is the case of our sharp-sighted and quick-witted opponent, who supposes his hearers
to be afflicted with the same blindness to the truth as himself. And who is so foolish as not
to compare the words which he calumniously assails with his charge itself, and by reading
them side by side to detect the malice of the writer? Our statement ascribes indestructibility;
he charges it with bestowing indestructibility. What has this to do with our statement? Every

<pb n="557"/>
man has a right to be judged by his own deeds, not to be blamed for those of others; and in
this present case, while he accuses us, and points his bitterness at us, in truth he is condemning
no one but himself. For if it is reprehensible to bestow indestructibility on God,
and this is done by no one but himself, is not our slanderer his own accuser, assailing his
own statements and not ours? And with regard to the term indestructibility, we assert that
as the life which is endless is rightly called indestructible, so that which is without beginning
is rightly called ungenerate. And yet Eunomius says that we lend Him the primacy over all
created things simply by reference to the ages.</p>
<p>I pass in silence his blasphemy in reducing God the Only-begotten to a level with all
created things, and, in a word, allowing to the Son of God no higher honour than theirs.
Still, for the sake of my more intelligent hearers, I will here give an instance of his insensate
malice. Basil, he says, lends God the primacy over all things by reference to the ages. What
unintelligible nonsense is this! Man is made God’s patron, and gives to God a primacy owing
to the ages! What is this vain flourish of baseless expressions, seeing that our Master simply
says that whatever in the Divine essence transcends the measurable distances of the ages in
either direction is called by certain distinctive names, in the case of Him Who, as saith the
Apostle, hath neither beginning of days nor end of life1186, in order that the distinction of
the conception might be marked by distinction in the names. And yet on this account Eunomius
has the effrontery to write, that to call that which is anterior to all beginning ungenerate,
and again that which is circumscribed by no limit, immortal and indestructible, is a
bestowing or lending on our part, and other nonsense of the kind. Moreover, he says that
we divide the ages into two parts, as if he had not read the words he quoted, or as if he were
addressing those who had forgotten his own previous statements. For what says our Master?
“If we look at the time before the Creation, and if passing in thought through the ages we
reflect on the infinitude of the Eternal Life, we signify the thought by the term ungenerate.
And if we turn our thoughts to what follows, and consider the being of God as extending
beyond all ages, we interpret the thought by the word endless or indestructible.” Well, how
does such an account sever the ages in twain, if by such possible words and names we signify
that eternity of God which is equally observable from every point of view, in all things the
same, unbroken in continuity? For seeing that human life, moving from stage to stage, advances
in its progress from a beginning to an end, and our life here is divided between that
which is past and that which is expected, so that the one is the subject of hope, the other of
memory; on this account, as, in relation to ourselves, we apprehend a past and a future in
this measurable extent, so also we apply the thought, though incorrectly, to the transcendent
nature of God; not of course that God in His own existence leaves any interval behind, or
passes on afresh to something that lies before, but because our intellect can only conceive
<note type="footnote">1186 Heb. vii. 3.</note>

<pb n="558"/>
things according to our nature, and measures the eternal by a past and a future, where
neither the past precludes the march of thought to the illimitable and infinite, nor the future
tells us of any pause or limit of His endless life. If, then, it is thus that we think and speak,
why does he keep taunting us with dividing the ages? Unless, indeed, Eunomius would
maintain that Holy Scripture does so too, signifying as it does by the same idea the infinity
of the Divine existence; David, for example, making mention of the “kingdom from everlasting,”
and Moses, speaking of the kingdom of God as “extending beyond all ages,” so that
we are taught by both that every duration conceivable is environed by the Divine nature,
bounded on all sides by the infinity of Him Who holds the universe in His embrace. For
Moses, looking to the future, says that “He reigneth from generation to generation for
evermore.” And great David, turning his thought backward to the past, says, “God is our
King before the ages1187,” and again, “God, Who was before the ages, shall hear us.” But
Eunomius, in his cleverness taking leave of such guides as these, says that we talk of the life
that is without beginning as one, and of that which is without end as quite another, and
again, of diversities of sundry ages, effecting by their own diversity a separation in our idea
of God. But that our controversy may not grow to a tedious length, we will add, without
criticism or comment, the outcome of Eunomius’ labours on the subject, well fitted as they
are by his industry displayed in the cause of error to render the truth yet more evident to
the eyes of the discerning.</p>
<p>For, proceeding with his discourse, he asks us what we mean by the ages. And yet we
ourselves might more reasonably put such questions to him. For it is he who professes to
know the essence of God, defining on his own authority what is unapproachable and incomprehensible
by man. Let him, then, give us a scientific lecture on the nature of the ages,
boasting as he does of his familiarity with transcendental things, and let him not so fiercely
brandish over us, poor ignorant individuals, the double danger of the dilemma involved in
our reply, telling us that, whether we hold this or that view of the ages, the result must be
in either case an absurdity. For if (says he) you say that they are eternal, you will be Greeks,
and Valentinians1188, and uninstructed1189: and if you say that they are generate, you will
no longer be able to ascribe ungeneracy to God. What a terribly unanswerable attack! If, O

Eunomius, something is held to be generate, we no longer hold the doctrine of the Divine
ungeneracy! And pray what has become of your subtle distinctions between generacy and
ungeneracy, by which you sought to establish the dissimilarity of the essence of the Son
from that of the Father? For it seems from what we are now being taught that the Father is
not dissimilar in essence when contemplated in respect of generacy, but that, in fact, if we
hold His ungeneracy, we reduce Him to non-existence; since “if we speak of the ages as
generate, we are driven to relinquish the Ungenerate.” But let us examine the force of the
argument, by which he would compel us to allow this absurdity. When, says he, those things
by comparison with which God is without beginning are non-existent, He Who is compared
with them must be non-existent also. What a sturdy and overpowering grip is this! How
tightly has this wrestler got us by the waist in his inextricable grasp! He says that God’s ungeneracy
is added to Him through comparison with the ages. By whom is it so added? Who
is there that says that to Him Who hath no beginning ungeneracy is added as an acquisition
through comparison with something else? Neither such a word nor such a sense will be
found in any writings of ours. Our words indeed carry their own justification, and contain
nothing like what is alleged against us; and of the meaning of what is said, who can be a
more trustworthy interpreter than he who said it? Have not we, then, the better title to say
what we mean when we speak of the life of God as extending beyond the ages? And what
we say is what we have said already in our previous writings. But, says he, comparison with
the ages being impossible, it is impossible that any addition should accrue from it to God,
meaning of course that ungeneracy is an addition. Let him tell us by whom such an addition
has been made. If by himself, he becomes simply ridiculous in laying his own folly to our
charge: if by us, let him quote our words, and then we will admit the force of his accusation.</p>
<p>But I think we must pass over this and all that follows. For it is the mere trifling of
children who amuse themselves with beginning to build houses in sand. For having composed
a portion of a paragraph, and not yet brought it to a conclusion, he shows that the same life
is without beginning and without end, thus in his eagerness working out our own conclusion.
For this is just what we say; that the Divine life is one and continuous in itself, infinite and
eternal, in no wise bounded by any limit to its infinity. Thus far our opponent devotes his
labours and exertions to the truth as we represent it, showing that the same life is on no side
limited, whether we look at that part of it which was before the ages, or at that which succeeds
them. But in his next remarks he returns to his old confusion. For after saying that the same
life is without beginning and without end, leaving the subject of life, and ranging all the
ideas we entertain about the Divine life under one head, he unifies everything. If, says he,
the life is without beginning and without end, ungenerate and indestructible, then indestructibility
and ungeneracy will be the same thing, as will also the being without beginning
and without end. And to this he adds the aid of arguments. It is not possible, he says, for
the life to be one, unless indestructibility and ungeneracy are identical terms. An admirable

<pb n="560"/>
“addition” on the part of our friend. It would seem, then, that we may hold the same language
in regard to righteousness, wisdom, power, goodness, and all such attributes of God. Let,
then, no word have a meaning peculiar to itself, but let one signification underlie every word
in a list, and one form of description serve for the definition of all. If you are asked to define
the word judge, answer with the interpretation of “ungeneracy”; if to define justice, be ready
with “the incorporeal” as your answer. If asked to define incorruptibility, say that it has the
same meaning as mercy or judgment. Thus let all God’s attributes be convertible terms,
there being no special signification to distinguish one from another. But if Eunomius thus
prescribes, why do the Scriptures vainly assign various names to the Divine nature, calling
God a Judge, righteous, powerful, long-suffering, true, merciful and so on? For if none of
these titles is to be understood in any special or peculiar sense, but, owing to this confusion
in their meaning, they are all mixed up together, it would be useless to employ so many
words for the same thing, there being no difference of meaning to distinguish them from
one another. But who is so much out of his wits as not to know that, while the Divine nature,
whatever it is in its essence, is simple, uniform, and incomposite, and that it cannot be
viewed under any form of complex formation, the human mind, grovelling on earth, and
buried in this life on earth, in its inability to behold clearly the object of its search, feels after
the unutterable Being in divers and many-sided ways, and never chases the mystery in the
light of one idea alone. Our grasping of Him would indeed be easy, if there lay before us
one single assigned path to the knowledge of God: but as it is, from the skill apparent in the
Universe, we get the idea of skill in the Ruler of that Universe, from the large scale of the
wonders worked we get the impression of His Power; and from our belief that this Universe
depends on Him, we get an indication that there is no cause whatever of His existence; and
again, when we see the execrable character of evil, we grasp His own unalterable pureness
as regards this: when we consider death’s dissolution to be the worst of ills, we give the name
of Immortal and Indissoluble at once to Him Who is removed from every conception of
that kind: not that we split up the subject of such attributes along with them, but believing
that this thing we think of, whatever it be in substance, is One, we still conceive that it has
something in common with all these ideas. For these terms are not set against each other
in the way of opposites, as if, the one existing there, the other could not co-exist in the same
subject (as, for instance, it is impossible that life and death should be thought of in the same
subject); but the force of each of the terms used in connection with the Divine Being is such
that, even though it has a peculiar significance of its own, it implies no opposition to the
term associated with it. What opposition, for instance, is there between “incorporeal” and
“just,” even though the words do not coincide in meaning: and what hostility is there between
goodness and invisibility? So, too, the eternity of the Divine Life, though represented under
the double name and idea of “the unending” and “the unbeginning,” is not cut in two by
this difference of name; nor yet is the one name the same in meaning as the other; the one

<pb n="561"/>
points to the absence of beginning, the other to the absence of end, and yet there is no division
produced in the subject by this difference in the actual terms applied to it.</p>
<p>Such is our position; our adversary’s, with regard to the precise meaning of this term1190,
is such as can derive no help from any reasonings; he only spits forth at random about it
these strangely unmeaning and bombastic expressions1191, in the framework of his sentences
and periods. But the upshot of all he says is this; that there is no difference in the meaning
of the most varied names. But we must most certainly, as it seems to me, quote this passage
of his word for word, lest we be thought to be calumniously charging him with something
that does not belong to him. “True expressions,” he says, “derive their precision from the
subject realities which they indicate; different expressions are applied to different realities,
the same to the same: and so one or other of these two things must of necessity be held:
either that the reality indicated is different (if the expressions are), or else that the indicating
expressions are not different.” With these and many other such-like words, he proceeds to
effect the object he has before him, excluding from the expression certain relations and affinities1192,
such as species, proportion, part, time, manner: in order that by the withdrawal
of all these “Ungeneracy” may become indicative of the substance of God. His process of
proof is in the following manner (I will express his idea in my own words). The life, he says,
is not a different thing from the substance; no addition may be thought of in connection
with a simple being, by dividing our conception of him into a communicating and communicated
side; but whatever the life may be, that very thing, he insists, is the substance. Here
his philosophy is excellent; no thinking person would gainsay this. But how does he arrive
at his contemplated conclusion, when he says, “when we mean the unbeginning, we mean
the life, and truth compels us by this last to mean the substance”? The ungenerate, then,
according to him is expressive of the very substance of God. We, on the other hand, while
we agree that the life of God was not given by another, which is the meaning of “unbeginning,”
think that the belief that the idea expressed by the words “not generated” is the substance
of God is a madman’s only. Who indeed can be so beside himself as to declare the
absence of any generation to be the definition of that substance (for as generation is involved
in the generate, so is the absence of generation in the ungenerate)? Ungeneracy indicates
that which is not in the Father; so how shall we allow the indication of that which is absent
to be His substance? Helping himself to that which neither we nor any logical conclusion

from the premises allows him, he lays it down that God’s Ungeneracy is expressive of God’s
life. But to make quite plain his delusion upon this subject, let us look at it in the following
way; I mean, let us examine whether, by employing the same method by which he, in the
case of the Father, has brought the definition of the substance to ungeneracy, we may not
equally bring the substance of the Son to ungeneracy.</p>
<p>He says, “The Life that is the same, and thoroughly single, must have one and the same
outward expression for it, even though in mere names, and manner, and order it may seem
to vary. For true expressions derive their precision from the subject realities which they indicate;
different expressions are applied to different realities, the same to the same; and so
one or other of these two things must of necessity be held; either that the reality indicated
is quite different (if the expressions are), or else that the indicating expressions are not different;”
and there is in this case no other subject reality besides the life of the Son, “for one
either to rest an idea upon, or to cast a different expression upon.” Is there, I may ask, any
unfitness in the words quoted, which would prevent them being rightly spoken or written
about the Only-begotten? Is not the Son Himself also a “Life thoroughly single”? Is there
not for Him also “one and the same” befitting “expression,” “though in mere names, and
manner, and order He may seem to vary”? Must not, for Him also, “one or other of these
two things be held” fixed, “either that the reality indicated is quite different, or else that the
indicating expressions are not different,” there being no other subject reality, besides his
life, “for one either to rest an idea upon, or to cast a different expression upon”? We mix up
nothing here with what Eunomius has said about the Father; we have only passed from the
same accepted premise to the same conclusion as he did, merely inserting the Son’s name
instead. If, then, the Son too is a single life, unadulterated, removed from every sort of
compositeness or complication, and there is no subject reality besides this life of the Son
(for how in that which is simple can the mixture of anything foreign be suspected? what we
have to think of along with something else is no longer simple), and if the Father’s substance
also is a single life, and of this single life, by virtue of its very life and its very singleness,
there are no differences, no increase or decrease in quantity or quality in it creating any
variation, it needs must be that things thus coinciding in idea should be called by the same
appellation also. If, that is, the thing that is detected both in the Father and the Son, I mean
the singleness of life, is one, the very idea of singleness excluding, as we have said, any variation,
it needs must be that the name befitting the one should be attached to the other also.
For as that which reasons, and is mortal, and is capable of thought and knowledge, is called
“man” equally in the case of Adam and of Abel, and this name of the nature is not altered
either by the fact that Abel passed into existence by generation, or by the fact that Adam
did so without generation, so, if the simplicity1193 and incompositeness of the Father’s life
<note type="footnote">1193 Reading εἴπερ τὸ ἁπλοῦν with the editt., which is manifestly required by the sense.</note>

<pb n="563"/>
has ungeneracy for its name, in like manner for the Son’s life the same idea will necessarily
have to be attached to the same utterance, if, as Eunomius says, “one or other of these two
things must of necessity be held; either that the reality indicated is quite different, or else
that the indicating expressions are not different.”</p>
<p>But why do we linger over these follies, when we ought rather to put Eunomius’ book
itself into the hands of the studious, and so, apart from any examination of it, to prove at
once to the discerning, not only the blasphemy of his opinion, but also the nervelessness of
his style1194? While in various ways, not going upon our apprehension of it, but following
his own fancy, he misinterprets the word Conception, just as in a night-battle nobody can
distinguish friend and foe, he does not understand that he is stabbing his own doctrine with
the very weapons he thinks he is turning upon us. For the point in which he thinks he is
most removed from the church of the orthodox is this; that he attempts to prove that God
became Father at some later time, and that the appellation of Fatherhood is later than all
those other names which attach to Him; for that He was called Father from that moment
in which He purposed in Himself to become, and did become, Father. Well, then, since in
this treatise he is for proving that all the names applied to the Divine Nature coincide with
each other, and that there is no difference whatever between them, and since one amongst
these applied names is Father (for as God is indestructible and eternal, so also He is Father),
we must either sanction, in the case of this term also, the opinion he holds about the rest,
and so contravene his former position, seeing that the idea of Fatherhood is found to be
involved in any of these other terms (for it is plain that if the meaning of indestructible and
Father is exactly the same, He will be believed to be, just as He is always indestructible, so
likewise always Father, there being one single signification, he says, in all these names): or
else, if he fears thus to testify to the eternal Fatherhood of God, he must perforce abandon
his whole argument, and own that each of these names has a meaning peculiar to itself; and
thus all this nonsense of his about the Divine names bursts like a bubble, and vanishes like
smoke.</p>
<p>But if he should still answer with regard to this opposition (of the Divine names), that
it is only the term Father, and the term Creator, that are applied to God as expressing production,
both words being so applied, as he says, because of an operation, then he will cut
short our long discussion of this subject, by thus conceding what it would have required a
laborious argument on our part to prove. For if the word Father and the word Creator have
the same meaning (for both arise from an operation), one of the things signified is exactly
equivalent to the other, since if the signification is the same, the subjects cannot be different.
If, then, He is called both Father and Creator because of an operation, it is quite allowable
<note type="footnote">1194 συνηθείας, lit. usage of language. Cf. Plato, Theæt. 168 B, ἐκ συνηθείας ῥημάτων τε καὶ ὀνομάτων. It
is used absolutely, by the Grammarians, for the “Vulgar dialect.”</note>

<pb n="564"/>
to interchange the names, and to turn one into the other and say that God is Creator of the
Son, and Father of a stone, seeing that the term Father is to be devoid of any meaning of
essential relation1195. Well, the monstrous conclusion that is hereby proved cannot remain
doubtful to those who reflect. For as it is absurd to deem a stone, or anything else that exists
by creation, Divine, it must be agreed that there is no Divinity to be recognized in the Onlybegotten
either, when that one identical meaning of an operation, by which God is called
both Father and Creator, assigns, according to Eunomius, both these terms to Him. But let
us hold to the question before us. He abuses our assertion that our knowledge of God is
formed by contributions of terms applied to different ideas, and says that the proof of His
simplicity is destroyed by us so, since He must partake of the elements signified by each
term, and only by virtue of a share in them can completely fill out His essence. Here I write
in my own language, curtailing his wearisome prolixity; and in answer to his foolish and
nerveless redundancy no sensible person, I think, would make any reply, except as regards
his charging us with “senselessness.” Now if anything of that description had been said by
us, we ought of course to retract it if it was foolishly worded, or, if there was any doubt as
to its meaning, to put an irreproachable interpretation upon it. But we have not said anything
of the kind, any more than the consequences of our words lead the mind to any such necessity.
Why, then, linger on that to which all assent, and weary the reader by prolonging the
argument? Who is really so devoid of reflection as to imagine, when he hears that our orthodox
conceptions of the Deity are gathered from various ways of thinking of Him, that the
Deity is composed of these various elements, or completes His actual fulness by participating
in anything at all? A man, say, has made discoveries in geometry, and this same man, let us
suppose, has made discoveries also in astronomy, and in medicine as well, and grammar,
and agriculture, and sciences of that kind. Will it follow, because there are these various
names of sciences viewed in connection with one single soul, that that single soul is to be
considered a composite soul? Yet there is a very great difference in meaning between
medicine and astronomy; and grammar means nothing in common with geometry, or
seamanship with agriculture. Nevertheless it is within the bounds of possibility that the idea
of each of these sciences should be associated with one soul, without that soul thereby becoming
composite, or, on the other hand, without all those terms for sciences blending into
one meaning. If, then, the human mind, with all such terms applied to it, is not injured as
regards its simplicity, how can any one imagine that the Deity, when He is called wise, and
just, and good, and eternal, and all the other Divine names, must, unless all these names are
made to mean one thing, become of many parts, or take a share of all these to make up the
perfection of His nature?</p>
<note type="footnote">1195 τῆς κατα φύσιν σχετικῆς σημασίας.</note>

<pb n="565"/>
<p>But let us examine a still more vehement charge of his against us; it is this: “If one must
proceed to say something harsher still, he does not even keep the Divine substance pure
and unadulterated from inferior and contradictory elements.” This is the charge, but the
proof of it is,—what? Observe the strong professional attack! “If He is imperishable only by
reason of the unending in His Life, and ungenerate only by reason of the unbeginning, then
wherein He is not imperishable He is perishable, and wherein He is not ungenerate He is
generated.” Then returning to the charge, he repeats, “He will then be, as unbeginning, at
once ungenerate and perishable, and, as unending, at once imperishable and generated.”
Such is his “harsher” statement, which, according to his threat, he has discharged against
us, to prove that we say that the Divine substance is mingled with contradictory and even
inferior elements. However, I think it is plain to all who keep unimpaired within themselves
the power of judging the truth, that our Master has given no handle at all, in what he has
said, to this calumniator, but that the latter has garbled it at will, and then, playing at arguing,
has drawn out this childish sophistry. But that it may be plainer still to all my readers, I will
repeat that statement of the Master word for word, and then confront Eunomius’ words
with it. “We call the Universal Deity” (he says) “imperishable and ungenerate, using these
words with different applications1196 of thought; for when we concentrate our view upon
the ages behind us, we find the life of the Deity transcending every limit, and so name Him
‘ungenerate’; but when we turn our thoughts upon the ages to come, we call the infinite in
Him, the boundless, the absence of all end to His living, ‘imperishability.’ As, then, this
endlessness is called imperishable, so too this beginninglessness is called ungenerate; and
we arrive at these names by Conception.” Such are the Master’s words, and by them he
teaches us this: that the Divine Life is essentially single and continuous with Itself, starting
from no beginning, circumscribed by no end; and that the intuitions which we possess regarding
this Life it is possible to make clear by words. That is, we express the never having
come from any cause by the term unbeginning or ungenerate; and we express the not being
circumscribed by any limit, and not being destroyed by any death, by the term imperishable,
or unending; and this absence of cause, he defines, makes it right for us to speak of the Divine
life as existing ungenerately; and this being without end we are to denote as imperishable,
since anything that has ceased to exist is necessarily in a state of annihilation, and when we
hear of anything annihilated, we at once think of the destruction of its substance. He says
then, that One Who never ceases to exist, and is a stranger to all destruction and dissolution,
is to be called imperishable.</p>
<p>What, then, does Eunomius say to this? “If He is imperishable only by reason of the
unending in His Life, and ungenerate only by reason of the unbeginning, then wherein He
is not imperishable He is perishable, and wherein He is not ungenerate He is generated.”
<note type="footnote">1196 ἐπιβολὰς.</note>

<pb n="566"/>
Who conceded to you this, Eunomius, that the imperishability is not to be associated with
the whole life of God? Who ever divided that Life into two parts, and then put particular
names to each half of the Life, so that to the division which the one name fitted the other
could not be said to apply? This is the result of your dialectic sharpness; to say that the Life
which has no beginning is perishable, and that what is imperishable cannot be associated
with what is unbeginning! It is just as if, when one had said that man was rational, as well
as capable of speculation and knowledge, attaching each phrase to the subject of them according
to a different application and idea, some one was to jeer, and to go on in the same
strain, “If man is capable of speculation and knowledge, he cannot, as regards this, be rational,
but wherein he is capable of such knowledge, he is this and this only, and his nature does
not admit of his being the other”; and reversely, if rational were made the definition of man,
he were to deny in this case his being capable of this speculation and knowledge; for “wherein
he is rational, he is proved devoid of mind.” But if the ridiculousness and absurdity in this
case is plain to any one, neither in that former case is it at all doubtful. When you have read
the passage from the Master, you will find that his childish sophistry will vanish like a
shadow. In our case of the definition of man, the capability of knowledge is not hindered
by the possession of reason, nor the reason by the capability of knowledge: no more is the
eternity of the Divine Life deprived of imperishability, if it be unbeginning, or of beginninglessness,
if we recognize its imperishability. This would-be seeker after truth, with the artifices
of his dialectic shrewdness, inserts in our argument what comes from his own repertoire;
and so he fights with himself and overthrows himself, without ever touching anything of
ours. For our position was nothing but this; that the Life as existing without beginning is
styled, by means of a fresh Conception, as ungenerate: is styled, I say, not, is made such;
and that we mark the Life as going on into infinity with the appellation of imperishable;
mark it, I say, as such, not, make it such; and that the result is, that while it is a property of
the Divine Life, inherent in the subject, to be infinite in both views, the thoughts associated
with that subject are expressed in this way or in that only as regards that particular term
which indicates the thought expressed. One thought associated with that life is, that it does
not exist from any cause; this is indicated by the term “ungenerate.” Another thought about
it is, that it is limitless and endless; this is represented by the word imperishable. Thus, while
the subject remains what it is, above everything, whether name or thought, the not being
from any cause, and the not changing into the non-existent, are signified by means of the
Conception implied in the aforesaid words.</p>
<p>What, then, out of all that we have said, has stirred him up to this piece of childish folly,
in which he returns to the charge and repeats himself in these words: “He will, then, be, as
unbeginning, at once ungenerate and perishable, and, as unending, at once imperishable
and generated.” It is plain to any possessing the least reflection, without our testing this lo-

<pb n="567"/>
gically, how absurdly foolish it is, or rather, how condemnably blasphemous. By the same
argument as that whereby he establishes this union of the perishable and the unbeginning,
he can make sport of any proper and worthily conceived name for the Deity. For it is not
these two ideas only that we associate with the Divine Life, I mean, the being without beginning,
and the not admitting of dissolution; but It is called as well immaterial and without
anger, immutable and incorporeal, invisible and formless, true and just; and there are
numberless other ways of thinking about the Divine Life, each one of which is announced
by an expressive sound with a peculiar meaning of its own. Well, to any name—any name,
I mean, expressive of some proper conception of the Deity—it is open for us to apply this
method of unnatural union devised by Eunomius. For instance, immateriality and absence
of anger are both predicated of the Divine Life; but not with the same thought in both cases;
for by the term immaterial we convey the idea of purity from any mixture with matter, and
by the term “without anger” the strangeness to any emotion of anger. Now in all probability
Eunomius will run trippingly over all this, and have his dance, just as before, upon our
words. Stringing together his absurdities in the same way, he will say: “If wherein He is
separated from all mixture with matter He is called immaterial, in this respect He will not
be without anger; and if by reason of His not indulging in anger He is without anger, it is
impossible to attribute to him immateriality, but logic will compel us to admit that, in so
far as He is exempt from matter, He is both immaterial and wrathful;” and so you will find
the same to be the case in respect to his other attributes. And if you like we will propound
another pairing of the same, i.e. His immutability and His incorporeality. For both these
terms being used of the Divine Life in a distinct sense, in their case also Eunomius’ skill will
embellish the same absurdity. For if His being always as He is is signified by the term immutable,
and if the term incorporeal represents the spirituality of His essence, Eunomius
will certainly say the same here also, that the terms are irreconcilable, and alien to each
other, and that the notions which our minds attach to them have no point of contact one
with the other; for insofar as God is always the same He is immutable, but not incorporeal;
and in regard to the spirituality and formlessness of His essence, while He possesses attributes
of incorporeality, He is not immutable; so that it happens that when immutability is considered
with respect to the Divine Life, along with that immutability it is established that It
is corporeal; but if spirituality is the object of search, you prove that It is at once incorporeal
and mutable.</p>
<p>Such are the clever discoveries of Eunomius against the truth. For what need is there to
go through all his argument with trifling prolixity? For in every instance you may see an
attempt to establish the same futility. For instance, by an implication such as that above,
what is true and what is just will be found opposed to each other; for there is a difference
in meaning between truth and justice. So that by a parity of reasoning Eunomius will say
about these also, that truth is not injustice, and that justice is absent from truth; and it will

<pb n="568"/>
happen that, when in respect of God we think of His being alien to injustice, the Divine
Being will be shown to be at once just and untrue, while if we regard His being alien to untruth,
we prove Him to be at once true and unjust. So, too, of His being invisible and formless.
For according to a wise reasoning similar to that which we have adduced, it will not be
permissible to say either that the invisible exists in that which is formless, or to say that that
which is formless exists in that which is invisible; but he will comprise form in that which
is invisible, and so again, conversely, he will prove that that which is formless is visible, using
the same language in respect of these as he devised in respect to that which is imperishable
and unbeginning, to the effect that when we regard the incomposite nature of the Divine
Life, we confess that it is formless, yet not invisible; and that when we reflect that we cannot
see God with our bodily eyes, while thus admitting His invisibility, we cannot admit His
being formless. Now if these instances seem ridiculous and foolish, much more will every
sensible man condemn the absurdity of the statements, starting from which his argument
has logically brought him to such a pitch of absurdity. Yet he carps at the Master’s words,
as wrong in seeing that which is imperishable in that which is unending, and that which is
unending in that which is imperishable. Well, then, let us also have our sport, in a manner
something like this cleverness of Eunomius. Let us examine his opinion about these two
names aforesaid, and see what it is.</p>
<p>Either, he says, that which is endless is distinct in meaning from that which is imperishable,
or else the two must make one. But if he call both one, he will be supporting our argument.
But if he say that the meaning of the imperishable is one thing, and that that of being
unending is another, then of necessity, in the case of things differing from each other, the
force of the one cannot be equivalent to the force of the other. If, then, the idea of the imper-
ishable is one, and that of being endless is another, and each of these is what the other is
not, neither will he grant that the imperishable is unending, nor that the unending is imperishable,
but the unending will be perishable, and the imperishable will be terminable. But I
must beg my readers not to turn a ridiculous method of condemnation against us. We have
been compelled to adopt such a sportive vein against the mockeries of our opponent, that
we might thereby break through the puerile toil of his sophistries. But if it would not be too
wearisome to my readers, it would not be out of place again to set forth what Eunomius
says in his own words. “If,” says he, “God is imperishable only by reason of the unending
in His Life, and ungenerate only by reason of the unbeginning, then wherein He is not imperishable
He is perishable, and wherein He is not ungenerate He is generated.” Then returning
to the charge, he repeats, “He will then be, as unbeginning, at once ungenerate and
perishable: and, as unending, at once imperishable and generated;” for I pass over the superfluous
and unseasonable remarks which he has interspersed here, as in no way contributing
to the proving of his point. Now I think it is easy for any one to see, by his own words, that
the drift of our argument has no connection whatever with the accusation which he lays

<pb n="569"/>
against us. “For we call the God of the universe imperishable and ungenerate,” says the
Master, “using these words with different applications.” “His transcending,” he continues,
“every limit of the ages, and every distance in temporal extension, whether we consider the
previous or the subsequent, this absence of limit or circumscription on either hand in the
Eternal Life we mark in the one case with the name of imperishability, and in the other case
with the name of ungeneracy.” But Eunomius would make out that we say that the being
without beginning is His essence, and again that the being without end is His essence, as
though we brought forward two contradictory segments of essence; and in this way he establishes
an absurdity, and while laying down, and then fighting against, positions of his
own, and reducing notions of his own concoction to an absurdity, he lays no hold on our
argument in any single point. For that God is imperishable only wherein His Life is unending,
is his statement, not ours. In like manner, that the imperishable is not without beginning,
is an invention of that same subtle cleverness which would constitute a negative attribute
an essence; whereas we do not define any such negative attribute as an essence. Now it is a
negative attribute of God, that neither does the Life cease in dissolution, nor did It have a
commencement in generation; and this we express by these two words, imperishability and
ungeneracy. But Eunomius, mixing up his own folly with our teaching, does not seem to
understand that he is publishing his own disgrace by his calumnious accusations. For, in
defining ungeneracy as an essence, he will logically arrive at the same pitch of absurdity
which he ascribes to our teaching. For as beginning means1197 one thing, and end means
another, by virtue of an intervening extension, if any one allow the privation of the first of
these to be essence, he must suppose His Life to be only half subsisting in this being without
beginning, and not to extend further, by virtue of His nature, to the being without end, if
ungeneracy be regarded as itself His nature. But if any one insist that both are essence, then,
according to the definition put forward by Eunomius, each of these terms must necessarily,
by virtue of its inherent meaning, be counted as essence, being just as much as, and no more
than, is indicated by the meaning of the term; and thus the argument of Eunomius will not
be without force, inasmuch as that which is without beginning does not involve the notion
of being without end, and vice versa, since according to his account each of the things
mentioned is an essence, and there is no confusion between the two in their relation to each
other, the notion of beginning being different to that of ending, while the words which express
privation of these also differ in their significations.</p>
<p>But that he himself also may be brought to the knowledge of his own trifling, we will
convict him from his own statements. For in the course of his argument he says that God,
in that He is without end, is ungenerate, and that, in that He is ungenerate, He is without
<note type="footnote">1197 The Latin is wrong here, “secundum rerum intellectarum distinctricem significationem;” for νοουμένων
without the article must be the gen. absol. Besides this the mss. read παράτασιν (not παράστασιν).</note>

<pb n="570"/>
end, as if the meanings of the two terms were identical. If, then, by reason of His being
without end He is ungenerate, and the being without end and ungenerate are convertible
terms, and he admits that the Son also is without end, by a parity of reasoning he must necessarily
admit that the Son is ungenerate, if (as he has said) His being without end and His
being without beginning are identical in meaning. For just as in the ungenerate he sees that
which is without beginning, so he allows that in that which is without end also he sees that
which is without beginning. For otherwise he would not have made the terms wholly convertible.
But God, he says, is ungenerate by nature, and not by contrast with the ages. Well,
who is there that contends that God is not by nature all that He is said to be? For we do not
say that God is just, and almighty, and Father, and imperishable, by contrast with the ages,
nor by His relation to any other thing that exists. But in connection with the subject itself,
whatever He may be in His nature, we entertain every idea that is a reverent idea; so that
supposing neither ages, nor any other created thing, had been made, God would no less be
what we believe Him to be, being in no need of the ages to constitute Him what He is. “But,”
says Eunomius, “He has a Life that is not extraneous, nor composite, nor admitting of differences;
for He Himself is Life eternal by virtue of that Life itself immortal, by virtue of that
immortality imperishable.” This we are taught respecting the Only-begotten as well; nor
can any one impugn this teaching without openly opposing the declaration of S. John. For
life was not brought in from without upon the Son either (for He says, “I am the Life1198”),
nor is His Life either composite, nor does it admit difference, but by virtue of that life itself
He is immortal (for in what else but in life can we see immortality?), and by virtue of that
immortality He is imperishable. For that which is stronger than death must naturally be
incapable of corruption.</p>
<p>Thus far our argument goes with him. But the riddle with which he accompanies his
words we must leave to those trained in the wisdom of Prunicus1199 to interpret: for he
seems to have produced what he has said from that system. “Being incorruptible without
beginning, He is ungenerate without end, being so called absolutely, and independently of
aught beside Himself.” Now whoever has purged ears and an enlightened understanding
knows, even without my saying it, that beyond the jingle of words produced by their extraordinary
combination, there is no trace of sense in what he says; and if any shadow of an
idea could be found in such a din of words, it would prove to be either profane or ridiculous.
For what do you mean when you say that He is without beginning as being without end,
and without end as being without beginning? Do you think beginning identical with end,
and that the two words are employed in the same sense, just as the appellations Simon and
Peter represent one and the same subject, and on this account, in accordance with your
<note type="footnote">1198 S. John xi. 25</note>
<note type="footnote">1199 This may mean “short-hand” i.e. something difficult to decipher. See Book I. vi. note 10.</note>

<pb n="571"/>
thinking beginning and end the same, did you, combining under one signification these
two words which denote privation of each other,—end, I mean, and beginning,—and taking
the being without end as convertible with the being without end, blend and confound one
word with the other; and is this the meaning of such a mixing up of words, when you say
that He is ungenerate as being without end, and that He is without end as being ungenerate?
Yet how is it that you did not see the profanity as well as the ridiculous folly of your words?
For if by this novel confusion of the words they are made convertible, so that ungenerate
means ungenerate without end, and that which is without end is such ungenerately, it follows
by necessity that that which is without end must needs be so as being ungenerate: and thus
it comes to pass, my good friend, that your much-talked-of ungeneracy, which you say is
the only characteristic of the Father’s essence, will be found to be shared with whatever is
immortal, and to be making all things consubstantial with the Father, because it is alike
apparent in all things whose life, by reason of their immortality, goes on to infinity,
archangels, that is, angels, human souls, and, it may be also, in the Apostate host, the Devil
and his dæmons. For if that which is without end, and imperishable, must also by your argument
be ungenerately imperishable, then in whatsoever is without end and imperishable
there must be connoted ungeneracy. These are the absurdities into which those men fall
who, before they have learnt what it is fitting for them to learn, only publish their own ignorance
by what they attempt to teach. For if he had any faculty of discernment, he would
not be ignorant of the peculiar sense inherent in his terms, “without beginning,” and “without
end,” and that the term without end is common to all things whose life we believe capable
of extension to infinity, while the term without beginning belongs to Him alone Who is
without originating cause. How, then, is it possible for us to regard that which is common
to them all, as equivalent to that which is believed by all to be a special attribute of the Deity
alone, so that we thereby either extend ungeneracy to everything that shares in immortality,
or else must not allow immortality to any one of them, seeing that the being without end is
to belong only to the ungenerate, and vice versa, the being ungenerate is to belong only to
that which is without end? Thus everything without end would have to be regarded as ungenerate.</p>
<p>But let us leave this, and along with it the usual foul deluge of calumny in his words;
and let us go on to his subsequent quotations (of Basil). But I think it would perhaps be well
to pass without examination over most of these subsequent words. For in all of them he
shows himself the same, not grappling with that which we have really said, but only inventing
for himself points for refutation which he pretends are taken from our statement. To go
carefully through these would be pronounced useless by any one possessed of judgment;
for any understanding reader of his book can from his very words perceive his scurrility.
He says that God’s Glory is prior to our leader’s “conception.” We too do not deny that. For
God’s glory, whatever we are to think of it, is prior not only to this present generation of

<pb n="572"/>
ours, but to all creation; it transcends the ages. What, then, is gained for his argument from
this fact, that God’s glory is conceded to be superior not only to Basil, but to all the ages?
“Yes, but this name is His glory,” he says. But pray tell us, in order that we may assent to
this statement, who has proved that the appellation is identical with the glory? “A law of
our nature,” he replies, “teaches us that, in naming realities, the dignity of the names does
not depend on the will of those who give them.” What is this law of nature? And how is it
that it is not in force amongst all? If nature had really enacted such a law, it ought to have
authority amongst all who share the common nature, just as the other things peculiar to
that nature have. If, in fine, it was the law of nature that caused the appellations to spring
up for us from the objects, just as her plants spring up from seeds and roots, and she did
not entrust the significant naming of each of the subjects to the choice of those who had to
indicate the objects, then all mankind would be of one tongue. For if the names imposed
upon these objects did not vary, we should not differ from one another in the department
of speech. He says it is “a holy thing, and most closely connected with the designs of
Providence, that their sounds should be imposed upon realities from a source above us.”
How is it, then, that the Prophets were ignorant of this holy thing, and were not instructed
in this design of Providence, who according to your account did not make God at all of this
Ungeneracy? How, too, is it that the Deity Himself never knew of this kind of holiness, when
He did not give names from above to the animals which He had formed, but gave away this
power of name-giving to Adam? If it is closely connected with the designs of Providence,
as Eunomius says, and a holy thing, that their sounds should be imposed from above upon
realities, it is certainly an unholy thing, and an unfitting thing, that these names should have
been fitted to the things that are by any here below. “But the universal Guardian,” he says,
“thought it right to engraft these names in our minds by a law of His creation.” And how
was it, then, if these were engrafted in the minds of men, that from Adam onward to your
transgression no fruits of this folly were produced, grafted as they were, according to you,
in those minds, so that ungeneracy should be the name of the Father’s essence? Adam and
all in succession after him would have pronounced this word, if such had been grafted by
God in his nature. For as all that now grows upon the earth continues always, owing to a
transmission of its seed from the first creation, and not one single seed at the present time
innovates upon the natural form, so this word, if it had been, as you say, grafted by God in
our nature, would have sprung up along with the first utterances of the first-formed human
beings, and would have accompanied the line of their posterity. But seeing that this word
did not exist at the first (for no one in former generations and up to the present ever uttered
such a word, except this man), it is plain that it is a bastard invention, that has sprung up
from the seed of tares, not from that good seed which God has sown, to use evangelic words,
in the field of our nature. For all the things that characterize our common nature do not
have their beginning now, but appeared with that nature at its first formation; such, for in-

<pb n="573"/>
stance, as the operation of the senses, the appetitive, or contrary, instinct of the man with
regard to anything, and other generally acknowledged accompaniments of his nature, none
of which a particular epoch has introduced amongst those born in it; but our humanity is
preserved continually, from first to last, within the same circle of qualities, losing none which
it had at the beginning, any more than it acquires any which it had not then. But just as,
while sight is a faculty common to our nature, scientific observation comes by training to
those who have devoted themselves to some science (it is not every one, for instance, who
can observe with the theodolite, or prove a theorem by means of lines in geometry, or do
anything else, where art has introduced, not mere sight, but a special use of sight), so too,
while one might pronounce the possession of reason to be a common property of humanity
united to the very essence of our nature from above, the invention of terms significative of
realities is the work of men who, possessing from above the power of reason, are continually
finding out, according as they wish for them towards the elucidation of that which they
plainly see, certain words expressive of these things. “But if these views are to prevail,” says
he, “one of two things is proved; either that conception is anterior to those who conceive,
or that the names naturally befitting the Deity, and pre-existent to everything, are posterior
to the beginning of man.” Ought we to continue the fight against such assertions, and join
issue with such manifest absurdity?</p>
<p>But who, pray, is so simple as to be harmed by such arguments, and to imagine that if
names are once believed to be an outcome of the reasoning faculty, he must allow that the
utterance of names is anterior to those who utter them, or else that he must think he is sinning
against the Deity, in that every man continues to name the Deity, according as each after
birth is capable of conceiving Him? As to this last supposition, it has been already explained
that the Supreme Being has no need Himself of words as delivered by a voice and a tongue;
and it would be superfluous to repeat what would only encumber the argument. In fine, a
Being Whose nature is neither lacking nor redundant, but simply perfect, neither fails to
possess anything that is necessary, nor possesses what is not necessary. Since, then, we have
proved previously, and all thinking men unanimously agree, that the calling by names is
not a necessity of the Deity, no one can deny the extreme profanity of thus assigning to Him
what is not a necessity.</p>
<p>But I do not think that we need linger on this, nor minutely examine that which follows.
To the more attentive reader, the argument elaborated by our opponent will itself appear
in the light of a special pleader on the side of orthodoxy. He says, for instance, that imperishability
and immortality are the very essence of the Deity. For my part I see no need to
contend with him, no matter whether these qualities aforesaid only accrue to the Deity, or
whether they are, by virtue of their signification, His essence; whichever of these two views
is adopted, it will completely support our argument. For if the being imperishable only accrues
to the essence, the not being generated will also most certainly only accrue to it; and

<pb n="574"/>
so the idea of ungeneracy will be ejected from being the mark of the essence. If, on the other
hand, because God is not subject to destruction, one affirms imperishability to be His essence,
and, because He is stronger than death, one therefore defines immortality to be His very
essence, and if the Son is imperishable and immortal (as He is), imperishability and immortality
will also be the essence of the Only-begotten. If, then, the Father is imperishability,
and the Son imperishability, and each of these imperishabilities is the essence, and no difference
exists between them as regards the idea of imperishability, one essence will differ from
the other essence in no way at all, seeing that in both equally the nature is a stranger to any
corruption. Even if he should resume the same method as before, and place us on the horns
of his dilemma from which, as he thinks, there is no escape, saying that, if we distinguish
that which accrues from that which is, we make the Deity composite, whereas if we acknowledge
His simplicity, then the imperishability and the ungeneracy are seen at once to be
significative of His very essence—even then again we can show that he is fighting for our
side. For if he will have it that God is made composite by our saying that anything accrues
to Him, then he certainly cannot eject the Fatherhood either from the essence, but must
confess that He is Father by His nature as much as He is imperishable and immortal; and
so without intending it he must admit the Son also to partake of that intimate nature; for it
will not be possible, if God is essentially Father, to exclude the Son from a relationship to
Him thus essential. But if he says that the Fatherhood accrues to God, but is outside the
circle of the substance, then he must concede to us that we may say anything we like accrues
to the Deity, since the Divine simplicity is in no way marred, if His quality of ungeneracy
is made to mean something outside the essence. If, however, he declares that the imperishability
and the ungeneracy do mean the essence, and if he insists that these two words are
equivalent, since, by reason of the same meaning lying in each, there is no difference between
them, and if he thus assert that the very idea of imperishability and ungeneracy is one and
the same, the One who is the first of these must necessarily be the second too. But that the
Son is imperishable, let us observe, even these men entertain no doubt; therefore, by Eunomius’
argument, the Son also is ungenerate, if imperishability and ungeneracy are to mean
the same thing. So that he must accept one of two alternatives; either he must agree with us
that ungeneracy is other than imperishability, or, if he abides by his assertions, he must in
various ways speak blasphemy about the Only-begotten, making Him, for instance, perishable,
in order that he may not have to say that He is ungenerate; or ungenerate, in order
that he may not prove Him perishable.</p>
<p>But now I do not know which it is best to do; to pursue step by step this subject, or to
put an end here to our contest with such folly. Well, as in the case of those who are selling
destructive drugs, a very slight experiment guarantees to the purchasers the destructive
power latent in all the drug, and no one doubts, after he has found out by an experiment its
partial deadliness, that the drug sold is entirely of this deadly character, so I think it can be

<pb n="575"/>
no longer doubtful to reflecting persons that this poisonous dose of argument, of which a
specimen has been shown in what we have already examined, will continue throughout to
be such as that which we have just refuted. For this reason I think it better not to prolong
this detailed dwelling upon his absurdities. Nevertheless, seeing that the champions of this
error discover plausibility for it from many quarters, and there is reason to fear lest to have
overlooked any of their efforts will be made a specious pretext for misrepresenting us as
having shirked their strongest point, I beg for this reason those who follow us out in this
work to accompany our argument still, without charging us with prolixity, while it expands
itself to meet the attacks of error along the whole line. Observe, then, that he has scarcely
ceased weaving in the depths of his slumber this dream about conception before he arms
himself again from his storehouse with those monstrous and senseless methods, and turns
his argument into another dream much more meaningless than his previous illusion. But
we may best know how absurd his efforts are by observing his treatment of “privation”;
though to grapple with his nonsense in all its range would require a Eunomius, or one of
his school, men who have never spent a thought on serious realities. We will, however, in
a concise way run over the heads of it, that while none of his charges is omitted, no meaningless
item may help to prolong the discussion to an absurd length.</p>
<p>When, then, he is on the point of introducing this treatment of terms of “privation,” he
takes upon himself to show “the incurable absurdity,” as he calls it, of our teaching, and its
“simulated and culpable caution1200.” Such is his promise; but the proof of these accusations
is, what? “Some have said that the Deity is ungenerate by virtue only of the privation of
generation; but we say, in refutation of these, that neither this word nor this idea is in any
way whatever applicable to the Deity.” Let him point out the maintainer of such a statement,
if any from the first creation of man to the present day, whether in foreign or in Greek lands,
has ever committed himself to such an utterance; and we will be silent. But no one in the
whole history of mankind will be found to have said such a thing, except some madman.
For who was ever so reeling from intoxication, who was ever so beside himself with madness
or delirium, as to say, in so many words, that generation belongs naturally to the ungenerate
God, but that, deprived of this natural condition, He becomes ungenerate instead of generated?
But these are the shifts of rhetoric; namely, to escape when they are refuted from the
shame of their refutation by means of some supposititious characters. It was in this way that
he has apologized for that celebrated “Apology” of his, transferring as he did the blame for
that title to jurymen and accusers1201, though unable to show that there were any accusers,
any trial, or any court at all. Now, too, with the air of one who would correct another’s folly,
he pretends that he is driven by necessity to speak in this way. This is what his proof of our
<note type="footnote">1200 εὐλαβείαν τινὰ προσποίητον καὶ ἐπίληπτον</note>
<note type="footnote">1201 See Book I. vii., ix., xi.</note>

<pb n="576"/>
“incurable absurdity,” and our “simulated and culpable caution,” amounts to. But he goes
on to say that we do not know what to do in our present position, and that to cover our
perplexity we take to abusing him for his worldly learning, while we ourselves claim a
monopoly of the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Here is his other dream, namely, that he has
got so much of the heathen learning, that he appears by means of it a formidable antagonist
to Basil. Just so there have been some men who have imagined themselves enthroned with
basilicals, and of an exalted rank, because the deluded vision of their dreams, born of their
waking longings, puts such fancies into their hearts. He says that Basil, not knowing what
to do after what has been said, abuses him for his worldly learning. He would indeed have
set a high value on such abuse, that is, on being thought formidable because of the abundance
of his words even by any ordinary hearer, not to mention by Basil, and by men like him (if
any are entirely like him, or ever have been). But, as for his intervening argument, if such
low scurrility, and such tasteless buffoonery, can be called argument, by which he thinks he
impugns our cause, I pass it all over, for I deem it an abominable and ungracious thing to
soil our treatise with such pollutions; and I loathe them as men loathe some swollen and
noisome ulcer, or turn from the spectacle presented by those whose skin is bloated by excess
of humours, and disfigured with tuberous warts. And for a while our argument shall be allowed
to expand itself freely, without having to turn to defend itself against men who are
ready to scoff at and to tear to pieces everything that is said.</p>
<p>Every term—every term, that is, which is really such—is an utterance expressing some
movement of thought. But every operation and movement of sound thinking is directed as
far as it is possible to the knowledge and the contemplation of some reality. But then the
whole world of realities is divided into two parts; that is, into the intelligible and the sensible.
With regard to sensible phænomena, knowledge, on account of the perception of them being
so near at hand, is open for all to acquire; the judgment of the senses gives occasion to no
doubt about the subject before them. The differences in colour, and the differences in all
the other qualities which we judge of by means of the sense of hearing, or smell, or touch,
or taste, can be known and named by all possessing our common humanity; and so it is with
all the other things which appear to be more obvious to our apprehension, the things, that
is, pertaining to the age in which we live, designed for political and moral ends. But in the
contemplation of the intelligible world, on account of that world transcending the grasp of
the senses, we move, some in one way, some in another, around the object of our search;
and then, according to the idea arising in each of us about it, we announce the result as best
we can, striving to get as near as possible to the full meaning of the thing thought about
through the medium of expressive phrases. In this, though it is often possible to have achieved
the task in both ways, when thought does not fail to hit the mark, and utterance interprets
the notion with the appropriate word, yet it may happen that we may fail even in both, or
in one, at least, of the two, when either the comprehending faculty or the interpreting capacity

<pb n="577"/>
is carried beside the proper mark. There being, then, two factors by which every term is
made a correct term, the mental exactitude and the verbal utterance, the result which commands
approval in both ways, will certainly be the preferable; but it will not be a lesser gain,
not to have missed the right conception, even though the word itself may happen to be inadequate
to that thought. Whenever then, our thought is intent upon those high and unseen
things which sense cannot reach (I mean, upon that divine and unspeakable world with regard
to which it is an audacious thing to grasp in thought anything in it at random and more
audacious still to trust to any chance word the representing of the conception arising from
it), then, I say, turning from the mere sound of phrases, uttered well or ill according to the
mental faculty of the speaker, we search for the thought, and that alone, which is found
within the phrases, to see whether that itself be sound, or otherwise; and we leave the minutiæ
of phrase and name to be dealt with by the artificialities of grammarians. Now, seeing that
we mark with an appellation only those things which we know, and those things which are
above our knowledge it is not possible to seize by any distinctive terms (for how can one
put a mark upon a thing we know nothing about?), therefore, because in such cases there
is no appropriate term to be found to mark the subject adequately, we are compelled by
many and differing names, as there may be opportunity, to divulge our surmises as they
arise within us with regard to the Deity. But, on the other hand, all that actually comes
within our comprehension is such that it must be of one of these four kinds: either contemplated
as existing in an extension of distance, or suggesting the idea of a capacity in space
within which its details are detected, or it comes within our field of vision by being circumscribed
by a beginning or an end where the non-existent bounds it in each direction (for
everything that has a beginning and an end of its existence, begins from the non-existent,
and ends in the non-existent), or, lastly, we grasp the phænomenon by means of an association
of qualities wherein dying, and sufferance, and change, and alteration, and such-like
are combined. Considering this, in order that the Supreme Being may not appear to have
any connection whatever with things below, we use, with regard to His nature, ideas and
phrases expressive of separation from all such conditions; we call, for instance, that which
is above all times pre-temporal, that which is above beginning unbeginning, that which is
not brought to an end unending, that which has a personality removed from body incorporeal,
that which is never destroyed imperishable, that which is unreceptive of change, or
sufferance, or alteration, passionless, changeless, and unalterable. Such a class of appellations
can be reduced to any system that they like by those who wish for one; and they can fix on
these actual appellations other appellations “privative,” for instance, or “negative,” or
whatever they like. We yield the teaching and the learning of such things to those who are
ambitious for it; and we will investigate the thoughts alone, whether they are within or
beyond the circle of a religious and adequate conception of the Deity.</p>

<pb n="578"/>
<p>Well, then, if God did not exist formerly, or if there be a time when He will not exist,
He cannot be called either unending or without beginning; and so also neither inalterable,
nor incorporeal, nor imperishable, if there is any suspicion of body, or destruction, or alteration
with regard to Him. But if it be part of our religion to attribute to Him none of these
things, then it is a sacred duty to use of Him names privative of the things abhorrent to His
Nature, and to say all that we have so often enumerated already, viz. that He is imperishable,
and unending, and ungenerate, and the other terms of that class, where the sense inherent
in each only informs us of the privation of that which is obvious to our perception, but does
not interpret the actual nature of that which is thus removed from those abhorrent conditions.
What the Deity is not, the signification of these names does point out; but what that further
thing, which is not these things, is essentially, remains undivulged. Moreover, even the rest
of these names, the sense of which does indicate some position or some state, do not afford
that indication of the Divine nature itself, but only of the results of our reverent speculations
about it. For when we have concluded generally that no single thing existing, whether an
object of sense or of thought, is formed spontaneously or fortuitously, but that everything
discoverable in the world is linked to the Being Who transcends all existences, and possesses
there the source of its continuance, and we then perceive the beauty and the majesty of the
wonderful sights in creation, we thus get from these and such-like marks a new range of
thoughts about the Deity, and interpret each one of the thoughts thus arising within us by
a special name, following the advice of Wisdom, who says that “by the greatness and beauty
of the creatures proportionately the Maker of them is seen1202.” We address therefore as
Creator Him Who has made all mortal things, and as Almighty Him Who has compassed
so vast a creation, Whose might has been able to realize His wish. When too we perceive
the good that is in our own life, we give in accordance with this the name of Good to Him
Who is our life’s first cause. Then also having learnt from the Divine writings the incorruptibility
of the judgment to come, we therefore call Him Judge and Just, and to sum up in one
word, we transfer the thoughts that arise within us about the Divine Being into the mould
of a corresponding name; so that there is no appellation given to the Divine Being apart
from some distinct intuition about Him. Even the word God (Θεὸς) we understand to have
come into usage from the activity of His seeing; for our faith tells us that the Deity is everywhere,
and sees (θεασθαι) all things, and penetrates all things, and then we stamp this
thought with this name (Θεὸς), guided to it by the Holy Voice. For he who says, “O God,
attend unto me1203,” and, “Look, O God1204,” and, “God knoweth the secrets of the heart
plainly1205,” reveals the latent meaning of this word, viz. that Θεὸς is so called from θεασθαι.

<note type="footnote">1204 Ps. cxix. 132.</note>
<note type="footnote">1205 Ps. xliv. 21.</note>

<pb n="579"/>
For there is no difference between saying “Attend unto,” “Look,” and “See.” Since, then, the
seer must look towards some sight, God is rightly called the Seer of that which is to be seen.
We are taught, then, by this word one sectional operation of the Divine Being, though we
do not grasp in thought by means of it His substance itself, believing nevertheless that the
Divine glory suffers no loss because of our being at a loss for a naturally appropriate name.
For this inability to give expression to such unutterable things, while it reflects upon the
poverty of our own nature, affords an evidence of God’s glory, teaching us as it does, in the
words of the Apostle, that the only name naturally appropriate to God is to believe Him to
be “above every name1206.” That he transcends every effort of thought, and is far beyond
any circumscribing by a name, constitutes a proof to man of His ineffable majesty1207.</p>
<p>Thus much, then, is known to us about the names uttered in any form whatever in reference
to the Deity. We have given a simple explanation of them, unencumbered with argument,
for the benefit of our candid hearers; as for Eunomius’ nerveless contentions about
these names, we judge it a thing disgraceful and unbecoming to us seriously to confute them.
For what could one say in answer to a man who declares that we “attach more weight to the
outward form of the name than to the value of the thing named, giving to names the
prerogative over realities, and equality to things unequal”? Such are the words that he gives
utterance to. Well, let any one who can do so considerately, judge whether this calumnious
charge of his against us has anything in it dangerous enough to make it worth our while to
defend ourselves as to our “giving to names the prerogative over realities”; for it is plain to
every one that there is no single name that has in itself any substantial reality, but that every
name is but a recognizing mark placed on some reality or some idea, having of itself no existence
either as a fact or a thought.</p>
<note type="footnote">1206 Philip. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">1207 The theology of Gregory and his master Origen rises above the unconscious Stoicism of Tertullian, and
even that of Clement, which has an air of materialistic pantheism about it, owing to his attempt, like that of
Eunomius, to base our knowledge of God upon abstractions and analogies drawn from nature. The result, indeed,
of the “abstraction process” of Clement is only a multiplication of negative terms, “immensity,” “simplicity,”
“eternity,” U+0026c. But they will lead to nothing, if there is not already behind them all some positive idea which we
have received from a different source. Faith is this source; it is described by Origen as “an ineffable grace of the
soul which comes from God in a kind of enthusiasm;” which formula expresses the primary fact of religious
consciousness such as Leibnitz demonstrated it: and the positive idea supplied by this faculty is with Origen
Goodness (rather than the Good). He would put Will as well as Mind into the Central Idea of Metaphysics, and
would have the heart governed as well as the reason. All that he says about the “incomprehensibility” of God
does not militate against this: for we must have some idea of that which is incomprehensible to us: and the
Goodness of the Deity is the side on which we gain this idea.</note>

<pb n="580"/>
<p>How it is possible, then, to assign one’s gratuities to the non-subsistent, let this man,
who claims to be using words and phrases in their natural force, explain to the followers of
his error. I would not, however, have mentioned this at all, if it had not placed a necessity
upon me of proving our author’s weakness both in thought and expression. As for all the
passages from the inspired writings which he drags in, though quite unconnected with his
object, formulating thereby a difference of immortality1208 in angels and in men, I do not
know what he has in his eye, or what he hopes to prove by them, and I pass them by. The
immortal, as long as it is immortal, admits of no degrees of more and less arising from
comparison. For if the one member of the comparison is, by the force of contrast, to suffer
a diminution or privation as regards its immortality, it must needs be that such a member
is not to be called immortal at all; for how can that be called absolutely immortal in which
mortality is detected by this juxtaposition and comparison? And to think of that fine hairsplitting
of his, in not allowing the idea of privation to be unvarying and general, but in asserting,
on the contrary, that while separation from good things is privation, the absence of
bad things is not to be marked by that term! If he is to get his way here, he will take the truth
from the Apostle’s words, which say that He “only hath immortality1209,” which He gives
to others. What this newly-imported dictum of his has to do with his preceding argument,
neither we nor any one else amongst reflecting people are able to understand. Yet because
we have not the mental strength to take in these scientific subtleties, he calls us “unscientific
both in our judgment as to objects, and in our use of terms”; those are his very words. But
all this, as having no power to shake the truth, I pass over without further notice; and also
how he misrepresents the view we have expounded of the imperishable, and of the unembodied,
namely, that of these terms the latter signifies the undimensional, where the threefold
extension belonging to all bodies is not to be found, and the former signifies that which is
not receptive of destruction: and also how he says, that “we do not think it right to let the
shape of these words be lost by extending them to ideas inapplicable to them, or to imagine
that each of them is indicative of something not present or not accruing; but rather we think
they are indicative of the actual essence”; all this I deem worthy only of silence and deep
oblivion, and leave to the reader to detect for himself their mingled folly and blasphemy.
He actually asserts that the perishable is not opposed to the imperishable, and that the
<note type="footnote">1208 But there are two meanings of ἀθάνατος,—and of these perhaps Eunomius was thinking,—i.e. 1. Not
dead; 2. Immortal. In Plato’s Phædo there is an argument for the immortality of the soul, certainly not the
strongest one, drawn from this. It is assumed there that the thing, whose nature is such that so long as it exists
it neither is nor can be dead, can never cease to exist i.e. the soul by virtue of not actually dying, though capable
of death, is immortal. Perhaps this accounts for Eunomius saying (lower down) that “the perishable is not opposed
to the imperishable.”</note>

privative sign does not mark the absence of the bad, but that the word which is the subject
of our inquiry means the essence itself!</p>
<p>Well, if the term imperishable or indestructible is not considered by this maker of an
empty system to be privative of destruction, then by a stern necessity it must follow that
this shape given to the word indicates the very reverse (of the privation of destruction). If,
that is, indestructibility is not the negation of destruction, it must be the assertion of something
incongruous with itself; for it is the very nature of opposites that, when you take away
the one, you admit the other to come in in its place. But as for the bitter task which he necessitates
of proving that the Deity is unreceptive of death, as if there existed any one who
held the contrary opinion, we leave it to take care of itself. For we hold that in the case of
opposites, it makes no difference at all whether we say that something is A, or that it is not
the opposite of A; for instance, in the present discussion, when we have said that God is
Life, we implicitly forbid by this assertion the thought of death in connection with Him,
even though we do not express this in speech; and when we assert that He is unreceptive of
death, we in the same breath show Him to be Life.</p>
<p>“But I do not see,” he rejoins, “how God can be above His own works simply by virtue
of such things as do not belong to Him1210.” And on the strength of this clever sally he calls
it a union of folly and profanity, that our great Basil has ventured on such terms. But I would
counsel him not to indulge his ribaldry too freely against those who use these terms, lest he
should be unconsciously at the same moment heaping insults on himself. For I think that
he himself would not gainsay that the very grandeur of the Divine Nature is recognized in
this, viz. in the absence of all participation in those things which the lower natures are shown
to possess. For if God were involved in any of these peculiarities, He would not possess His
superiority, but would be quite identified with any single individual amongst the beings
who share that peculiarity. But if He is above such things, by reason, in fact, of His not
possessing them, then He stands also above those who do possess them; just as we say that
the Sinless is superior to those in sin. The fact of being removed from evil is an evidence of
abounding in the best. But let him heap these insults on us to his heart’s content. We will
<note type="footnote">1210 The reasoning, which precedes and follows, amounts to this. Basil had said that the terms ungenerate,
imperishable, immortal, are privative, i.e. express the absence of a quality. Eunomius objects that—No term
expressive of the absence of a quality can be God’s Name: the Ungenerate (which includes the others) is God’s
Name, therefore It does not express a privation. You mean to say, Gregory replies, that Ungenerate, U+0026c. does
not mean not-generated, U+0026c. But what is not not-generated is generated (by your own law of dichotomy);
therefore, Ungenerate means generated; and you prove God perishable and mortal. Here, the fallacy arises from
Gregory’s assuming more than Eunomius’ conclusion: i.e. “the Ungenerate means not only the not-generated,”
changes into “the Ungenerate does not mean,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="582"/>
only remark, in passing, on a single one of the points mentioned under this head, and will
then return to the discussion of the main question.</p>
<p>He declares that God surpasses mortal beings as immortal, destructible beings as indes-
tructible, generated beings as ungenerate, just in the same degree. Is it not, then, plain to all
what this blasphemy of a fighter against God would prove? or must we by verbal demonstration
unveil the profanity? Well, who does not know the axiom, that things which are distanced
to the same amount (by something else) are level with one another? If, then, the destructible
and the generated are surpassed in the same degree by the Deity, and if our Lord is generated,
it will be for Eunomius to draw the blasphemous conclusion resulting from these data. For
it is clear that he regards generation as the same thing as destruction and death, just as in
his previous discussions he declares the ungenerate to be the same thing as the indestructible.
If, then, he looks upon destruction and generation as upon the same level, and asserts that
the Deity is equally removed from both of them, and if our Lord is generated, let no one
demand from ourselves that we should apply the logical conclusion, but let him draw it for
himself; if indeed it is true, as he says, that from the generated and from the destructible
God is equally removed. “But,” he proceeds, “it is not allowable for us to call Him indestructible
and immortal by virtue of any absence of death and destruction.” Let those who are led
by the nose, and turn in any direction that each successive teacher pleases, believe this, and
let them declare that destruction and death do belong to God, to make it possible for Him
to be called immortal and indestructible! For if these terms of privation, as Eunomius says,
“do not indicate the absence of death and destruction,” then the presence in Him of the
things opposite to, and estranged from, these is most certainly proved by this treatment of
terms. Each one amongst conceivable things is either absent from something else, or it is
not absent: for instance, light, darkness; life, death; health, disease, and so on. In all these
cases, if one asserts that the one conception is absent, he will necessarily demonstrate that
the other is present. If, then, Eunomius denies that God can be called immortal by reason
of the absence of death, he will plainly prove the presence of death in Him, and so deny any
immortality in the case of the universal Deity. But perhaps some one will say that we fix
unfairly on his words; for that no one is so mad as to affirm that God is not immortal. But
then, when none of mankind possess any knowledge of that which certain people secretly
imagine, it is by their words that we have to make our guess about those secret things.</p>
<p>Therefore let us again handle this dictum of his: “God is not called immortal by virtue
of the absence of death.” How are we to accept this statement, that death is not absent from
the Deity though He be called immortal? If he really commands us to think like this, Eunomius’
God will be certainly mortal, and subject to destruction; for he from whom death is
not absent is not in his essence immortal. But again; if these terms signify the absence neither
of death nor of destruction, either they are applied falsely to the God overall, or else they
comprise within themselves some different meaning. What this meaning is, our system-

<pb n="583"/>
maker must explain to us. Whereas we, the people who according to Eunomius are unscientific
in our judgment of objects and in our use of terms, have been taught to call sound (for
instance), not the man from whom strength is absent, but the man from whom disease is
absent; and unmutilated, not the man who keeps away from drinking-parties, but the man
who has no mutilation upon him; and other qualities in the same way we name from the
presence or the absence of something; manly, for instance, and unmanly; sleepy and sleepless;
and all the other terms like that, which custom sanctions.</p>
<p>Still I cannot see what profit there is in deigning to examine such nonsense. For a man
like myself, who has lived to gray hairs1211, and whose eyes are fixed on truth alone, to take
upon his lips the absurd and flippant utterances of a contentious foe, incurs no slight danger
of bringing condemnation on himself. I will therefore pass over both those words and the
adjoining passage; this, for instance, “Truth gives no evidence of any union of natures with
God.” Well, if these words had not been spoken, who ever was there (except yourself) who
mentioned a double nature in the Deity at all? You, however, unite each idea of each name
with the essence of the Father, and deny that anything externally accrues to Him, centering
every one of His names in that essence. Again, “Neither does she write in the statute-book
of our religion any idea that is external and fabricated by ourselves.” With regard to these
words again I shall deprecate the idea that I have quoted them with a view of amusing the
reader with their absurdity; rather I have done so with a view to show with what a slender
equipment of arguments this man, after rating us for our want of system, advances to take
these audacious liberties with the name of Truth. What is he in reasoning, and what is he
in speech, that he should thus revel in showing himself off before his hidebound readers,
who applaud him as victorious over everybody by force of argument when he has brought
these disjointed utterances of his dry bombastic jargon to an end1212. “Immortality,” he
says, “is the essence itself.” But what, then, do you assert to be the essence of the Only-begotten?
I ask you that: is it immortality, or is it not? For remember that in His essence also
the singleness admits, as you say, of no complexity of nature. If, then Eunomius denies that
immortality is the essence of the Son, it is clear what he is aiming at; for it does not require
an exceedingly penetrating understanding to discover what is the direct opposite to the
immortal. Just as the logic of dichotomy exhibits the destructible instead of the indestructible,
and the mutable instead of the immutable, so it exhibits the mortal instead of the immortal.
<note type="footnote">1211 This cannot have been written earlier than 384. The preceding twelve books, of which an instalment
only was read to Gregory the Nazianzene and others during the Council of Constantinople, 381, must have occupied
him a considerable time: and there may have been an interval after that before this essay was composed.</note>

<pb n="584"/>
What, therefore, will this setter forth of new doctrine do? What proper name will he give
us for the essence of the Only-begotten? Again I put this question to our author. He must
either grant that it is immortality, or deny it. If, then, he will not assent to its being immortality,
he must assent to the contradictory proposition; by negativing the superior term he
proves that it is death. If, on the other hand, he shrinks from anything so monstrous, and
names the essence of the Only-begotten also as immortality, he must perforce agree with
us that there is in consequence no difference whatever, as to essence, between them. If the
nature of the Father and the nature of the Son are equally immortality, and if immortality
does not divide itself by any manner of difference, then it is confessed by our foes themselves,
that on the score of essence no manner of difference is discoverable between the Father and
the Son.</p>
<p>But it is time now to expose that angry accusation which he brings against us at the
close of his treatise, saying that we affirm the Father to be from what is absolutely non-existent.
Stealing an expression from its context, from which he drags it, as from its surrounding
body, into a naked isolation, he tries to carp at it by worrying the word, or rather covering
it with the slaver of his maddened teeth. I will therefore first give the meaning of the passage
in which our Master explained this point to us; then I will quote it word for word: by so
doing the man who intrudes upon1213 the expository work of orthodox writers, only to
undermine the truth itself, will be revealed in his true colours. Our Master, in introducing
us in his own treatise to the true meaning of ungenerate, suggested a way to arrive at a real
knowledge of the term in dispute somewhat as follows, pointing out at the same time that
it had a meaning very far removed from any idea of essence. He says that the Evangelist1214,
in beginning our Lord’s lineage according to the flesh from Joseph, and then going back to
the generation continually preceding, and then ending the genealogy in Adam, and, because
there was no earthly father anterior to this first-formed creature, saying that he was “the
son of God,” makes it obvious to every reader’s intelligence with regard to the Deity, that
He, from Whom Adam was, has not Himself His subsistence from another, after the likeness
of the human lives just given. When, having passed through the whole of it, we at last grasp
the thought of the Deity, we perceive at the same moment the First Cause of it all. But if any
such cause be found dependent on something else, then it is not a first cause. Therefore, if
God is the First Cause of the Universe, there will be nothing whatever transcending this
cause of all things. Such was our Master’s exposition of the meaning of ungenerate; and in
order that our testimony about it may not go beyond the exact truth, I will quote the passage.</p>
<p>“The evangelist Luke, when giving the genealogy according to the flesh of our God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, and stepping up from the last to the first, begins with Joseph, saying
<note type="footnote">1213 εἰσφθειρόμενος</note>
<note type="footnote">1214 S. Luke iii. 23, sqq.</note>

<pb n="585"/>
that he was ‘the son of Heli, which was the son of Matthat,’ and so by ascending brings his
enumeration up to Adam; but when he has come to the top and said, that Seth ‘was the son
of Adam, which was the son of God,’ then he stops this process. As, then, he has said that
Adam was the son of God, we will ask these men, ‘But God, who is He the son of?’ Is it not
obvious to every one’s intelligence that God is the son of no one? But to be the son of no
one is to be without a cause, plainly; and to be without a cause is to be ungenerate. Now in
the case of men, the being son of somebody is not the essence1215; no more, in the case of
the Deity Who rules the world, is it possible to say that the being ungenerate is the essence.”</p>
<p>With what eyes will you now dare to gaze upon your guide? I speak to you, O flock1216
of perishing souls! How can you still turn to listen to this man who has reared such a
monument as this of his shamelessness in argument? Are ye not ashamed now, at least, if
not before, to take the hand of a man like this to lead you to the truth? Do ye not regard it
as a sign of his madness as to doctrine, that he thus shamelessly stands out against the truth
contained in Scripture? Is this the way to play the champion of the truth of doctrine—namely,
to accuse Basil of deriving the God over all from that which has absolutely no existence?
Am I to tell the way he phrases it? Am I to transcribe the very words of his shamelessness?
I let the insolence of them pass; I do not blame their invective, for I do not censure one
whose breath is of bad odour, because it is of bad odour; or one who has bodily mutilation,
<note type="footnote">1215 οὐκ ἦν οὐσία τὸ ἔκ τινος. This is Oehler’s reading from the mss.</note>
<note type="footnote">1216 O flock. This could not have been written earlier than 384, and there is abundant testimony that Eunomius
still had his “flock.” Long before this, even soon after he had left his see of Cyzicus, and had taken up his
abode with Eudoxius, he separated himself from that champion of the Homoean party, and held assemblies
apart because he had repeatedly entreated that his preceptor Aetius might be received into communion (Socrates
iv. 13). This must have been about 366, before his banishment by Valens for favouring the rebellion of Procopius.
Sozomen says (vi. 29), “The heresy of Eunomius was spread from Cilicia and the Mountains of Taurus as far as
the Hellespont and Constantinople.” In 380 at Bithynia near Constantinople “multitudes resorted to him, some
also gathered from other quarters, a few with the design of testing his principles, and others merely from the
desire of listening to his discourses. His reputation reached the ears of the Emperor, who would gladly have had
a conference with him. But the Empress Flacilla studiously prevented an interview taking place between them;
for she was the most faithful guard of the Nicene doctrines” (vii. 17). At the convention, however, of all the sects
at Theodosius’ palace in 382, Eunomius was present (Socrates v. 10). His ἔκθεσις τῆς πίστεως (to which he added
learned notes) was laid before Theodosius in 383. It was not till 391 that the Emperor condemned him to banishment—
the sole exception to Theodosius’ toleration. “This heretic,” says Sozomen again, “had fixed his residence
in the suburbs of Constantinople and held frequent assemblies in private houses, where he read his own writings.
He induced many to embrace his sentiments, so that the sectarians who were named after him became very
numerous. He died not long after his banishment, and was interred at Dacora, his birthplace, a village of Cappadocia.”</note>

because he is mutilated. Things such as that are the misfortunes of nature; they escape blame
from those who can reflect. This strength of vituperation, then, is infirmity in reasoning; it
is an affliction of a soul whose powers of sound argument are marred. No word from me,
then, about his invectives. But as to that syllogism, with its stout irrefragable folds, in whose
conclusion, to effect his darling object, he arrives at this accusation against us, I will write
it out in its own precise words. “We will allow him to say that the Son exists by participation
in the self-existent1217; but (instead of this), he has unconsciously affirmed that the God
over all comes from absolute nonentity. For if the idea of the absence of everything amounts
to that of absolute nonentity1218, and the transposition of equivalents is perfectly legitimate,
then the man who says that God comes from nothing says that He comes from nonentity.”
To which of these statements shall we first direct our attention? Shall we criticize his opinion
about the Son “existing by participation” in the Deity, and his bespattering those who will
not acquiesce in it with the foulness of his tongue; or shall we examine the sophism so frigidly
constructed from the stuff of dreams? However, every one who possesses a spark of practical
sagacity is not unaware that it is only poets and moulders of mythology who father sons “by
participation” upon the Divine Being. Those, that is, who string together the myths in their
poems, fabricate a Dionysus, or a Hercules, or a Minos, and such-like, out of the combination
of the superhuman with human bodies; and they exalt such personages above the rest of
mankind, representing them as of greater estimation because of their participation in a superior
nature. Therefore, with regard to this opinion of his, carrying as it does within itself
the evidence of its own folly and profanity, it is best to be silent; and to repeat instead that
irrefragable syllogism of his, in order that every poor ignoramus on our side may understand
what and how many are the advantages which those who are not trained in his technical
methods are deprived of. He says, “If the idea of the absence of everything amounts to that
of absolute nonentity, and the transposition of equivalents is perfectly legitimate, then the
man who says that God comes from nothing, says that He comes from nonentity.” He
brandishes over us this Aristotelian weapon, but who has yet conceded to him, that to say
that any one has no father amounts to saying that he has been generated from absolute
nonentity? He who enumerates those persons whose line is recorded in Scripture is plainly
thinking of a father preceding each person mentioned. For what relation is Heli to Joseph?
What relation is Matthat to Heli? And what relation is Adam to Seth? Is it not plain to a
mere child that this catalogue of names is a list of fathers? For if Seth is the son of Adam,
Adam must be the father of one thus born from him; and so tell me, who is the father of the
Deity Who is over all? Come, answer this question, open your lips and speak, exert all your
skill in expression to meet such an inquiry. Can you discover any expression that will elude

the grasp of your own syllogism? Who is the father of the Ungenerate? Can you say? If you
can, then He is not ungenerate. Pressed thus, you will say, what indeed necessity compels
you to say,—No one is. Well, my dear sir, do you not yet find the weak seams of your
sophism giving way? Do you not perceive that you have slavered upon your own lap? What
says our great Basil? That the Ungenerate One is from no father. For the conclusion to be
drawn from the mention of fathers in the preceding genealogy permits the word father, even
in the silence of the evangelist, to be added to this confession of faith. Whereas, you have
transformed “no one” into “nothing at all,” and again “nothing at all” into “absolute nonentity,”
thereby concocting that fallacious syllogism of yours. Accordingly this clever result
of professional shrewdness shall be turned against yourself. I ask, Who is the father of the
Ungenerate One? “No one,” you will be obliged to answer; for the Ungenerate One cannot
have a father. Then, if no one is the father of the Ungenerate, and you have changed “no
one” into “nothing at all,” and “nothing at all” is, according to your argument, the same as
“absolute nonentity,” and the transposition of equivalents is, as you say, perfectly legitimate,
then the man (i.e. you) who says that no one is the father of the Ungenerate One, says that
the Deity Who is over all comes from absolute nonentity!</p>
<p>Such, to use your own words, is the “evil,” as one might expect, not indeed “of valuing
the character for being clever before one is really such” (for perhaps this does not amount
to a very great misfortune), but of not knowing oneself, and how great the distance is between
the soaring Basil and a grovelling reptile. For if those eyes of his, with their divine penetration,
still looked on this world, if he still swept over mankind now living on the pinions of his
wisdom, he would have shown you with the swooping rush of his words, how frail is that
native shell of folly in which you are encased, how great is he whom you oppose with your
errors, while, with insults and invectives hurled at him, you are hunting for a reputation
amongst decrepit and despicable creatures. Still you need not give up all hope of feeling that
great man’s talons1219. For this work of ours, while, as compared with his, it will be a great
thing for it to be judged the fraction of one such talon, has, as regards yours, ability enough
to have broken asunder the outside crust of your heresy, and to have detected the deformity
that hides within.</p>

<head>On the Holy Spirit.</head>
<head>Against the Followers of Macedonius. 1220</head>
<note type="footnote">1220 Macedonius had been a very eminent Semi-Arian doctor. He was deposed from the See of Constantinople,
A.D. 360: and it was actually the influence of the Eunomians that brought this about. He went into exile and
formed his sect. He considered the Holy Spirit as “a divine energy diffused throughout the universe: and not a
person distinct from the Father and the Son” (Socrates, H. E. iv. 4). This opinion had many partizans in the
Asiatic provinces, “but,” says Mosheim, “the Council of Constantinople crushed it.” However, that the final
clauses of the Nicene Creed which express distinctly, amongst other truths, the deity and personality of the
Third Person of the Trinity were added at that Council to the original form, is extremely doubtful. For—1. We
find the expanded form which we now use in the Nicene Creed, in a work written by Epiphanius seven years
before the Council of Constantinople. So that at all events the enlarged Creed was not prepared by the Fathers
then assembled. 2. It is extremely doubtful if any symbol at all was set forth at Constantinople. Neither Socrates,
nor Sozomen, nor Theodoret makes mention of one: but all speak of adherence to the evangelic faith ratified at
Nicæa. It is significant too that the expanded form was entirely ignored by the Council of Ephesus, 431. But at
the Council of Chalcedon, 451, it was brought forward: though even then it appears that it was far from attaining
general acceptance. By 540 it had become the accepted form (according to a letter of Pope Vigilius). “It seems
most likely therefore that it was a profession received amongst the churches in the patriarchate of Constantinople,
but at first not more widely circulated” (J. R. Lumby, Commentary on Prayer-Book, S. P. C. K., p. 66) F. J. A.
Hort, however, (see Two Dissertations by) regards this “Constantinopolitan” Creed as the old Creed of Jerusalem
enlarged and expanded; and he suggests that S. Cyril of Jerusalem may have produced it before the Council,
which gave it some sort of approval. The addition, moreover, of the later clauses was not, as Mosheim seems to
imagine, the only difference between the Nicene Creed and this Creed. That this lateness of accepted definition on
a vital point should not excite our wonder, Neander shows “the apprehension of the idea (of the ὁμοούσιον of the Holy
Spirit) had been so little permeated as yet by the Christian consciousness of the unity of God, that Gregory of Nazianzum
could still say in 380, ‘Some of our theologians consider the Holy Spirit to be a certain mode of the Divine energy, others
a creature of God, others God Himself. Others say they do not know which opinion they ought to accept, out of reverence
for the Scriptures which have not clearly explained this point.’ Hilary of Poictiers says in his own original way that ‘he
was well aware that nothing could be foreign to God’s nature, which searches into the deep things of that nature. Should
one be displeased at being told that He exists by and through Him, by and from Whom are all things, that He is the
Spirit of God, but also God’s gift to believers, then will the apostles and prophets displease him; for they affirm only that
He exists.’” There can be little doubt, however, that Gregory, in the following fragment, is defending a statement already
in existence. He seems even to follow the order of the words, “Lord and giver of Life.” “Who with the Father and the Son
together is worshipped and glorified.” Doubtless the next clause, “Who spake by the Prophets,” was dealt with in what
is lost. But, essentially a creed-maker as he was, his claim to have himself added these final clauses cannot be substantiated.

<p>It may indeed be undignified to give any answer at all to the statements that are foolish;
we seem to be pointed that way by Solomon’s wise advice, “not to answer a fool according
to his folly.” But there is a danger lest through our silence error may prevail over the truth,
and so the rotting sore1221 of this heresy may invade it, and make havoc of the sound word
of the faith. It has appeared to me, therefore, to be imperative to answer, not indeed according
to the folly of these men who offer objections of such a description to our Religion, but for
the correction of their depraved ideas. For that advice quoted above from the Proverbs gives,
I think, the watchword not for silence, but for the correction of those who are displaying
some act of folly; our answers, that is, are not to run on the level of their foolish conceptions,
but rather to overturn those unthinking and deluded views as to doctrine.</p>
<p>What then is the charge they bring against us? They accuse us of profanity for entertaining
lofty conceptions about the Holy Spirit. All that we, in following the teachings of the
Fathers, confess as to the Spirit, they take in a sense of their own, and make it a handle
against us, to denounce us for profanity1222. We, for instance, confess that the Holy Spirit
is of the same rank as the Father and the Son, so that there is no difference between them
in anything, to be thought or named, that devotion can ascribe to a Divine nature. We
confess that, save His being contemplated as with peculiar attributes in regard of Person,
the Holy Spirit is indeed from God, and of the Christ, according to Scripture1223, but that,
while not to be confounded with the Father in being never originated, nor with the Son in
being the Only-begotten, and while to be regarded separately in certain distinctive properties,
He has in all else, as I have just said, an exact identity1224 with them. But our opponents
aver that He is a stranger to any vital communion with the Father and the Son; that by
reason of an essential variation He is inferior to, and less than they in every point; in power,
in glory, in dignity, in fine in everything that in word or thought we ascribe to Deity; that,

Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria to express the identity of Glory, of Godhead, and of Honour, in the Blessed

in consequence, in their glory He has no share, to equal honour with them He has no claim;
and that, as for power, He possesses only so much of it as is sufficient for the partial activities
assigned to Him; that with the creative force He is quite disconnected.</p>
<p>Such is the conception of Him that possesses them; and the logical consequence of it is
that the Spirit has in Himself none of those marks which our devotion, in word or thought,
ascribes to a Divine nature. What then, shall be our way of arguing? We shall answer nothing
new, nothing of our own invention, though they challenge us to it; we shall fall back upon
the testimony in Holy Scripture about the Spirit, whence we learn that the Holy Spirit is
Divine, and is to be called so. Now, if they allow this, and will not contradict the words of
inspiration, then they, with all their eagerness to fight with us, must tell us why they are for
contending with us, instead of with Scripture. We say nothing different from that which
Scripture says.—But in a Divine nature, as such, when once we have believed in it, we can
recognize no distinctions suggested either by the Scripture teaching or by our own common
sense; distinctions, that is, that would divide that Divine and transcendent nature within
itself by any degrees of intensity and remission, so as to be altered from itself by being more
or less. Because we firmly believe that it is simple, uniform, incomposite, because we see in
it no complicity or composition of dissimilars, therefore it is that, when once our minds
have grasped the idea of Deity, we accept by the implication of that very name the perfection
in it of every conceivable thing that befits the Deity. Deity, in fact, exhibits perfection in
every line in which the good can be found. If it fails and comes short of perfection in any
single point, in that point the conception of Deity will be impaired, so that it cannot, therein,
be or be called Deity at all; for how could we apply that word to a thing that is imperfect
and deficient, and requiring an addition external to itself?</p>
<p>We can confirm our argument by material instances. Fire naturally imparts the sense
of heat to those who touch it, with all its component parts1225; one part of it does not have
the heat more intense, the other less intense; but as long as it is fire at all, it exhibits an invariable
oneness with itself in an absolutely complete sameness of activity; if in any part it
gets cooled at all, in that part it can no longer be called fire; for, with the change of its heatgiving
activity into the reverse, its name also is changed. It is the same with water, with air,
with every element that underlies the universe; there is one and the same description of the
element, in each case, admitting of no ideas of excess or defect; water, for instance, cannot
be called more or less water; as long as it maintains an equal standard of wetness, so long
the term water will be realized by it; but when once it is changed in the direction of the opposite
quality1226 the name to be applied to it must be changed also. The yielding, buoyant,
<note type="footnote">1225 Reading μορίοις (cf. the same word below) for μορίαν.</note>
<note type="footnote">1226 πρὸς τὴν ἐναντίαν ποιότητα.</note>

<pb n="591"/>
“nimble”1227 nature of the air, too, is to be seen in every part of it; while what is dense, heavy,
downward gravitating, sinks out of the connotation of the very term “air.” So Deity, as long
as it possesses perfection throughout all the properties that devotion1228 may attach to it,
by virtue of this perfection in everything good does not belie its name; but if any one of
those things that contribute to this idea of perfection is subtracted from it, the name of Deity
is falsified in that particular, and does not apply to the subject any longer. It is equally impossible
to apply to a dry substance the name of water, to that whose quality is a state of
coolness the name of fire, to stiff and hard things the name of air, and to call that thing Divine
which does not at once imply the idea of perfection; or rather the impossibility is greater in
this last case.</p>
<p>If, then, the Holy Spirit is truly, and not in name only, called Divine both by Scripture
and by our Fathers, what ground is left for those who oppose the glory of the Spirit? He is
Divine, and absolutely good, and Omnipotent, and wise, and glorious, and eternal; He is
everything of this kind that can be named to raise our thoughts to the grandeur of His being.
The singleness of the subject of these properties testifies that He does not possess them in
a measure only, as if we could imagine that He was one thing in His very substance, but
became another by the presence of the aforesaid qualities. That condition is peculiar1229 to
those beings who have been given a composite nature; whereas the Holy Spirit is single and
simple in every respect equally. This is allowed by all; the man who denies it does not exist.
If, then, there is but one simple and single definition of His being, the good which He possesses
is not an acquired good; but, whatever He may be besides, He is Himself Goodness,
and Wisdom, and Power, and Sanctification, and Righteousness, and Everlastingness, and
Imperishability, and every name that is lofty, and elevating above other names. What, then,
is the state of mind that leads these men, who do not fear the fearful sentence passed upon
the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, to maintain that such a Being does not possess glory?
For they clearly put that statement forward; that we ought not to believe that He should be
glorified: though I know not for what reason they judge it to be expedient not to confess
the true nature of that which is essentially glorious.</p>
<p>For the plea will not avail them in their self-defence, that He is delivered by our Lord
to His disciples third in order, and that therefore He is estranged from our ideal of Deity.
Where in each case activity in working good shows no diminution or variation whatever,
how unreasonable it is to suppose the numerical order to be a sign of any diminution or
essential variation1230! It is as if a man were to see a separate flame burning on three torches
<note type="footnote">1227 nimble, κουφὸν; compare Macbeth, I. vi. “The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our
senses.”</note>

<pb n="592"/>
(and we will suppose that the third flame is caused by that of the first being transmitted to
the middle, and then kindling the end torch1231), and were to maintain that the heat in the
first exceeded that of the others; that that next it showed a variation from it in the direction
of the less; and that the third could not be called fire at all, though it burnt and shone just
like fire, and did everything that fire does. But if there is really no hindrance to the third
torch being fire, though it has been kindled from a previous flame, what is the philosophy
of these men, who profanely think that they can slight the dignity of the Holy Spirit because
He is named by the Divine lips after the Father and the Son? Certainly, if there is in our
conceptions of the Substance of the Spirit anything that falls short of the Divine ideal, they
do well in testifying to His not possessing glory; but if the highness of His dignity is to be
perceived in every point, why do they grudge to make the confession of His glory? As if any
one after describing some one as a man, were to consider it not safe to go on to say of him
as well that he is reasoning, mortal, or anything else that can be predicated of a man, and
so were to cancel what he had just allowed; for if he is not reasoning, he is not a man at all;
but if the latter is granted, how can there be any hesitation about the conceptions already
implied in “man”? So, with regard to the Spirit, if when one calls Him Divine one speaks
the truth, neither when one defines Him to be worthy of honour, to be glorious, good, omnipotent,
does one lie; for all such conceptions are at once admitted with the idea of Deity.
So that they must accept one of two alternatives; either not to call Him Divine at all, or to
refrain from subtracting from His Deity any one of those conceptions which are attributable
to Deity. We must then, most surely, comprehend along with each other these two thoughts,
viz. the Divine nature, and along with it a just idea, a devout intuition1232, of that Divine
and transcendent nature.</p>
<p>Since, then, it has been affirmed, and truly affirmed, that the Spirit is of the Divine Essence,
and since in that one word “Divine” every idea of greatness, as we have said, is involved,
it follows that he who grants that Divinity has potentially granted1233 all the rest;—the
gloriousness, the omnipotence, everything indicative of superiority. It is indeed a monstrous
thing to refuse to confess this in the case of the Spirit; monstrous, because of the incongruity,
as applied to Him, of the terms which in the list of opposites correspond to the above terms.

express the Son, as sticking constantly in this to the language of the Scriptures (John xv. 26)”—Pearson. The
language of the above simile of Gregory would be an illustration of this. So Greg. Naz., Orat. I. de Filio, “standing
on our definitions, we introduce the Ungenerate, the Generated, and that which proceeds from the Father.”
This last expression was so known and public, that it is recorded even by Lucian in his Philopatris, §12.</note>

I mean, if one does not grant gloriousness, one must grant the absence of gloriousness; if
one sets aside His power, one must acquiesce in its opposite. So also with regard to honour,
and goodness, and any other superiority, if they are not accepted, their opposites must be
conceded.</p>
<p>But if all must shrink from that, as going even beyond the most revolting blasphemy,
then a devout mind must accept the nobler names and conceptions of the Holy Spirit, and
must pronounce concerning Him all that we have already named, that He has honour,
power, glory, goodness, and everything else that inspires devotion. It must own, too, that
these realities do not attach to Him in imperfection or with any limit to the quality of their
brilliance, but that they correspond with their names to infinity. He is not to be regarded
as possessing dignity up to a certain point, and then becoming different; but He is always
such. If you begin to count behind the ages, or if you fix your gaze on the Hereafter1234, you
will find no falling off whatever in dignity, or glory, or omnipotence, such as to constitute
Him capable of increase by addition, or of diminution by subtraction. Being wholly and
entirely perfect, He admits diminution in nothing. Whereinsoever, on such a supposition
as theirs, He is lessened, therein He will be exposed to the inroad of ideas tending to dishonour
Him. For that which is not absolutely perfect must be suspected on some one point of
partaking of the opposite character. But if to entertain even the thought of this is a sign of
extreme derangement of mind, it is well to confess our belief that His perfection in all that
is good is altogether unlimited, uncircumscribed, in no particular diminished.</p>
<p>If such is the doctrine concerning Him when followed out1235, let the same inquiry be
made concerning the Son and the Father as well. Do you not confess1236 a perfection of
glory in the case of the one as in the case of the other? I think that all who reflect will allow
it. If, then, the honour of the Father is perfect, and the honour of the Son is perfect, and they
have confessed as well the perfection of honour for the Holy Spirit, wherefore do these new
theorists dictate to us that we are not to allow in His case an equality of honour with the
Father and the Son? As for ourselves, we follow out the above considerations and find
ourselves unable to think, as well as to say, that that which requires no addition for its perfection
is, as compared with something else, less dignified; for when we have something
wherein, owing to its faultless perfection, reason can discover no possibility of increase, I
do not see either wherein it can discover any possibility of diminution. But these men, in
denying the equality of honour, really lay down the comparative absence of it; and so also
when they follow out further this same line of thought, by a diminution arising from comparison
they divert all the conceptions that devotion has formed of the Holy Spirit; they do

<pb n="594"/>
not own His perfection either in goodness, or omnipotence, or in any such attribute. But if
they shrink from such open profanity and allow His perfection in every attribute of good,
then these clever people must tell us how one perfect thing can be more perfect or less perfect
than another perfect thing; for so long as the definition of perfection applies to it, that thing
can not admit of a greater and a less in the matter of perfection.</p>
<p>If, then, they agree that the Holy Spirit is perfect absolutely, and it has been admitted
in addition that true reverence requires perfection in every good thing for the Father and
the Son as well, what reasons can justify them in taking away the Father1237 when once they
have granted Him? For to take away “equality of dignity” with the Father is a sure proof
that they do not think that the Spirit has a share in the perfection of the Father. And as regards
the idea itself of this honour in the case of the Divine Being, from which they would exclude
the Spirit, what do they mean by it? Do they mean that honour which men confer on men,
when by word and gesture they pay respect to them, signifying their own deference in the
form of precedence and all such-like practices, which in the foolish fashion of the day are
kept up in the name of “honour.” But all these things depend on the goodwill of those who
perform them; and if we suppose a case in which they do not choose to perform them, then
there is no one amongst mankind who has from mere nature any advantage, such that he
should necessarily be more honoured than the rest; for all are marked alike with the same
natural proportions. The truth of this is clear; it does not admit of any doubt. We see, for
instance, the man who to-day, because of the office which he holds, is considered by the
crowd an object of honour, becoming tomorrow himself one of those who pay honour, the
office having been transferred to another. Do they, then, conceive of an honour such as that
in the case of the Divine Being, so that, as long as we please to pay it, that Divine honour is
retained, but when we cease to do so it ceases too at the dictate of our will? Absurd thought,
and blasphemous as well! The Deity, being independent of us, does not grow in honour; He
is evermore the same; He cannot pass into a better or a worse state; for He has no better,
and admits no worse.</p>
<p>In what sort of manner, then, can you honour the Deity? How can you heighten the
Highest? How can you give glory to that which is above all glory? How can you praise the
Incomprehensible? If “all the nations are as a drop of a bucket1238,” as Isaiah says, if all living
humanity were to send up one united note of praise in harmony together, what addition
will this gift of a mere drop be to that which is glorious essentially? The heavens are telling
<note type="footnote">1237 i.e.from fellowship with the Spirit. The text is τίς ὁ λόγος καθ᾽ ὃν εὔλογον κρίνουσιν πατέρα ἀναιρεῖν,
δεδώκασι; (for which δεδωκόσι is a conjecture). But perhaps πνεῦμα ἀναιρεῖν, διδάσκωσι, or διδάξωσι, would
be a more intelligible reading; though the examples of the hortatory subjunctive other than in the first person
are, according to Porson (ad Eurip. Hec. 430), to be reckoned among solecisms in classical Greek.</note>

the glory of God1239, and yet they are counted poor heralds of His worth; because His
Majesty is exalted, not as far as the heavens, but high above those heavens, which are
themselves included within a small fraction of the Deity called figuratively His “span1240.”
And shall a man, this frail and short-lived creature, so aptly likened to “grass,” who “to-day
is,” and to-morrow is not, believe that he can worthily honour the Divine Being? It would
be like some one lighting a thin fibre from some tow and fancying that by that spark he was
making an addition to the dazzling rays of the sun. By what words, pray, will you honour
the Holy Spirit, supposing you do wish to honour Him at all? By saying that He is absolutely
immortal, without turning, or variableness, always beautiful, always independent of ascription
from others, working as He wills all things in all, Holy, leading, direct, just, of true utterance,
“searching the deep things of God,” “proceeding from the Father,” “receiving1241 from the
Son,” and all such-like things, what, after all, do you lend to Him by these and such-like
terms? Do you mention what He has, or do you honour Him by what He has not? Well, if
you attest what He has not, your ascription is meaningless and comes to nothing; for he
who calls bitterness “sweetness,” while he lies himself, has failed to commend that which is
blamable. Whereas, if you mention what He has, such and such a quality is essential,
whether men recognize it or not; He remains the object of faith1242, says the Apostle, if we
have not faith.</p>
<p>What means, then, this lowering and this expanding of their soul, on the part of these
men who are enthusiastic for the Father’s honour, and grant to the Son an equal share with
Him, but in the case of the Spirit are for narrowing down their favours; seeing that it has
been demonstrated that the intrinsic worth of the Divine Being does not depend for its
contents upon any will of ours, but has been always inalienably inherent in Him? Their
narrowness of mind, and unthankfulness, is exposed in this opinion of theirs, while the
Holy Spirit is essentially honourable, glorious, almighty, and all that we can conceive of in
the way of exaltation, in spite of them.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replies one of them, “but we have been taught by Scripture that the Father is the
Creator, and in the same way that it was ‘through the Son1243’ that ‘all things were made’;
but God’s word tells us nothing of this kind about the Spirit; and how, then, can it be right
to place the Holy Spirit in a position of equal dignity with One Who has displayed such
magnificence of power through the Creation?”</p>

<p>What shall we answer to this? That the thoughts of their hearts are so much idle talk,
when they imagine that the Spirit was not always with the Father and the Son, but that, as
occasion varies, He is sometimes to be contemplated as alone, sometimes to be found in the
closest union with Them. For if the heaven, and the earth, and all created things were really
made through the Son and from the Father, but apart from the Spirit, what was the Holy
Spirit doing at the time when the Father was at work with the Son upon the Creation? Was
He employed upon some other works, and was this the reason that He had no hand in the
building of the Universe? But, then, what special work of the Spirit have they to point to, at
the time when the world was being made? Surely, it is senseless folly to conceive of a creation
other than that which came into existence from the Father through the Son. Well, suppose
that He was not employed at all, but dissociated Himself from the busy work of creating by
reason of an inclination to ease and rest, which shrank from toil?</p>
<p>May the gracious Spirit Himself pardon this baseless supposition of ours! The blasphemy
of these theorists, which we have had to follow out in every step it takes, has caused us unwittingly
to soil our discussion with the mud of their own imaginings. The view which is
consistent with all reverence is as follows. We are not to think of the Father as ever parted
from the Son, nor to look for the Son as separate from the Holy Spirit. As it is impossible
to mount to the Father, unless our thoughts are exalted thither through the Son, so it is
impossible also to say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit are to be known only in a perfect Trinity, in closest consequence and union
with each other, before all creation, before all the ages, before anything whatever of which
we can form an idea1244. The Father is always Father, and in Him the Son, and with the Son
the Holy Spirit. If these Persons, then, are inseparate from each other, how great is the folly
of these men who undertake to sunder this indivisibility by certain distinctions of time, and
so far to divide the Inseparable as to assert confidently, “the Father alone, through the Son
alone, made all things”; the Holy Spirit, that is, being not present at all on the occasion of
this making, or else not working. Well, if He was not present, they must tell us where He
was; and whether, while God embraces all things, they can imagine any separate standingplace
for the Spirit, so that He could have remained in isolation during the time occupied
by the process of creating. If, on the other hand, He was present, how was it that He was
inactive? Because He could not, or because He would not, work? Did He abstain willingly,
or because some strong necessity drove Him away? Now, if He deliberately embraced this
inactivity, He must reject working in any other possible way either; and He Who affirmed
that “He worketh all things in all, as He wills1245,” is according to them a liar. If, on the
contrary, this Spirit has the impulse to work, but some overwhelming control hinders His

<pb n="597"/>
design, they must tell us the wherefore of this hindrance. Was it owing to his being grudged
a share in the glory of those operations, and in order to secure that the admiration at their
success should not extend to a third person as its object; or to a distrust of His help, as if
His co-operation would result in present mischief? These clever men most certainly furnish
the grounds for our holding one of these two hypotheses; or else, if a grudging spirit has no
connection with the Deity, any more than a failure can be conceived of in any relation to
an Infallible Being, what meaning of any kind is there in these narrow views of theirs, which
isolate the Spirit’s power from all world-building efficiency? Their duty rather was to expel
their low human way of thinking, by means of loftier ideas, and to make a calculation more
worthy of the sublimity of the objects in question. For neither did the Universal God make
the universe “through the Son,” as needing any help, nor does the Only-begotten God work
all things “by the Holy Spirit,” as having a power that comes short of His design; but the
fountain of power is the Father, and the power of the Father is the Son, and the spirit of that
power is the Holy Spirit; and Creation entirely, in all its visible and spiritual extent, is the
finished work of that Divine power. And seeing that no toil can be thought of in the composition
of anything connected with the Divine Being (for performance being bound to the
moment of willing, the Plan at once becomes a Reality), we should be justified in calling all
that Nature which came into existence by creation a movement of Will, an impulse of Design,
a transmission of Power, beginning from the Father, advancing through the Son, and completed
in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This is the view we take, after the unprofessional way usual with us; and we reject all
these elaborate sophistries of our adversaries, believing and confessing as we do, that in
every deed and thought, whether in this world, or beyond this world, whether in time or in
eternity, the Holy Spirit is to be apprehended as joined to the Father and Son, and is wanting
in no wish or energy, or anything else that is implied in a devout conception of Supreme
Goodness1246; and, therefore, that, except for the distinction of order and Person, no variation
in any point is to be apprehended; but we assert that while His place is counted third in
mere sequence after the Father and Son, third in the order of the transmission, in all other
respects we acknowledge His inseparable union with them; both in nature, in honour, in
godhead, and glory, and majesty, and almighty power, and in all devout belief.</p>
<p>But with regard to service and worship, and the other things which they so nicely calculate
about, and bring into prominence, we say this; that the Holy Spirit is exalted above all
that we can do for Him with our merely human purpose; our worship is far beneath the
honour due; and anything else that in human customs is held as honourable is somewhere
below the dignity of the Spirit; for that which in its essence is measureless surpasses those
who offer their all with so slight and circumscribed and paltry a power of giving. This, then,
<note type="footnote">1246 κατὰ τὸ ἀγαθόν; probably here in its Platonic, rather than its ordinary sense.</note>

we say to those of them who subscribe to the reverential conception of the Holy Spirit that
He is Divine, and of the Divine nature. But if there is any of them who rejects this statement,
and this idea involved in the very name of Divinity, and says that which, to the destruction
of the Spirit’s greatness, is in circulation amongst the many, namely, that He belongs, not
to making, but to made, beings, that it is right to regard Him not as of a Divine, but as of a
created nature, we answer to a proposition such as this, that we do not understand how we
can count those who make it amongst the number of Christians at all. For just as it would
not be possible to style the unformed embryo a human being, but only a potential one, assuming
that it is completed so as to come forth to human birth, while as long as it is in this
unformed state, it is something other than a human being; so our reason cannot recognize
as a Christian one who has failed to receive, with regard to the entire mystery, the genuine
form of our religion1247. We can hear Jews believing in God, and our God too: even our
Lord reminds1248 them in the Gospel that they recognize no other God than the Father of
the Only-begotten, “of Whom ye say that he is your God.” Are we, then, to call the Jews
Christians because they too agree to worship the God Whom we adore? I am aware, too,
that the Manichees go about vaunting the name of Christ. Because they hold revered the
Name to which we bow the knee, shall we therefore number them amongst Christians? So,
too, he who both believes in the Father and receives the Son, but sets aside the Majesty of
the Spirit, has “denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel,” and belies the name of Christ
which he bears. The Apostle bids the man of God to be “perfect1249.” Now, to take only the
general man, perfection must consist in completeness in every aspect of human nature, in
having reason, capability of thought and knowledge, a share of animal life, an upright
bearing, risibility, broadness of nail; and if any one were to term some individual a man,
and yet were unable to produce evidence in his case of the foregoing signs of human nature,
his terming him so would be a valueless honour. Thus, too, the Christian is marked by his
Belief in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; in this consists the form of him who is fashioned1250
in accordance with the mystery of the truth. But if his form is arranged otherwise, I will not
recognize the existence of anything whence the form is absent; there is a blurring out of the
mark, and a loss of the essential form, and an alteration of the characteristic signs of our
complete humanity, when the Holy Spirit is not included in the Belief. For indeed the word
of Ecclesiastes says true; your heretic is no living man, but “bones,” he says1251, “in the

womb of her that is with child1252”; for how can one who does not think of the unction
along with the Anointed be said to believe in the Anointed? “Him,” says (Peter), “did God
anoint with the Holy Spirit1253.”</p>
<p>These destroyers of the Spirit’s glory, who relegate Him to a subject world, must tell us
of what thing that unction is the symbol. It not a symbol of the Kingship? And what? Do
they not believe in the Only-begotten as in His very nature a King? Men who have not once
for all enveloped their hearts with the Jewish “vail1254” will not gainsay that He is this. If,
then, the Son is in His very nature a king, and the unction is the symbol of His kingship,
what, in the way of a consequence, does your reason demonstrate? Why, that the Unction
is not a thing alien to that Kingship, and so that the Spirit is not to be ranked in the Trinity
as anything strange and foreign either. For the Son is King, and His living, realized, and
personified Kingship is found in the Holy Spirit, Who anoints the Only-begotten, and so
makes Him the Anointed, and the King of all things that exist. If, then, the Father is King,
and the Only-begotten is King, and the Holy Ghost is the Kingship, one and the same
definition of Kingship must prevail throughout this Trinity, and the thought of “unction”
conveys the hidden meaning that there is no interval of separation between the Son and the
Holy Spirit. For as between the body’s surface and the liquid of the oil nothing intervening
can be detected, either in reason or in perception, so inseparable is the union of the Spirit
with the Son; and the result is that whosoever is to touch the Son by faith must needs first
encounter the oil in the very act of touching; there is not a part of Him devoid of the Holy
Spirit. Therefore belief in the Lordship of the Son arises in those who entertain it, by means
of the Holy Ghost; on all sides the Holy Ghost is met by those who by faith approach the
Son. If, then, the Son is essentially a King, and the Holy Spirit is that dignity of Kingship
which anoints the Son, what deprivation of this Kingship, in its essence and comparing it
with itself, can be imagined?</p>
<p>Again, let us look at it in this way. Kingship is most assuredly shown in the rule over
subjects. Now what is “subject” to this Kingly Being? The Word includes the ages certainly,
and all that is in them; “Thy Kingdom,” it says, “is a Kingdom of ages,” and, by ages, it means
every substance in them created in infinite space1255, whether visible or invisible; for in
them all things were created by the Maker of those ages. If, then, the Kingship must always
be thought of along with the King, and the world of subjects is acknowledged to be something
other than the world of rulers, what absurdity it is for these men to contradict themselves

thus, attributing as they do the unction as an expression for the worth of Him Whose very
nature it is to be a King, yet degrading that unction Itself to the rank of a subject, as if
wanting in such worth! If It is a subject by virtue of its nature, then why is It made the unction
of Kingship, and so associated with the Kingly dignity of the Only-begotten? If, on the other
hand, the capacity to rule is shown by Its being included in the majesty of Kingship, where
is the necessity of having everything dragged down to a plebeian1256 and servile lower condition,
and numbered with the subject creation? When we affirm of the Spirit the two conditions,
we cannot be in both cases speaking the truth: i.e. that He is ruling, and that He is
subject. If He rules, He is not under any lord, but if He is subject, then He cannot be com-
prehended with the Being who is a King. Men are recognized as amongst men, angels
amongst angels, everything amongst its kind; and so the Holy Spirit must needs be believed
to belong to one only of two worlds; to the ruling, or to the inferior world; for between these
two our reason can recognize nothing; no new invention of any natural attribute on the
borderland of the Created and the Uncreated can be thought of, such as would participate
in both, yet be neither entirely; we cannot imagine such an amalgamation and welding together
of opposites by anything being blended of the Created and the Uncreated, and two
opposites thus coalescing into one person, in which case the result of that strange mixture
would not only be a composite thing, but composed of elements that were unlike, and disagreeing
as to time; for that which receives its personality from a creation is assuredly posterior
to that which subsists without a creation.</p>
<p>If, then, they declare the Holy Ghost to be blended of both, they must consequently
view that blending as of a prior with a posterior thing; and, according to them, He will be
prior to Himself; and reversely, posterior to Himself; from the Uncreated He will get the
seniority, and from the Created the juniority. But, in the nature of things, this cannot be;
and so it must most certainly be true to affirm of the Holy Spirit one only of these alternatives,
and that is, the attribute of being Uncreated; for notice the amount of absurdity involved
in the other alternative; all things that we can think of in the actual creation have, by virtue
of all having received their existence by an act of creation, a rank and value perfectly equal
in all cases, and so what reason can there be for separating the Holy Spirit from the rest of
the creation, and ranking Him with the Father and the Son? Logic, then, will discover this
about Him; That which is contemplated as part of the Uncreated, does not exist by creation;
or, if It does, then It has no more power than its kindred creation, It cannot associate itself
with that Transcendent Nature; if, on the other hand, they declare that He is a created being,
and at the same time has a power which is above the creation, then the creation will be found
at variance with itself, divided into ruler and ruled, so that part of it is the benefactor, part

the benefited, part the sanctifier, part the sanctified; and all that fund of blessings which we
believe to be provided for the creation by the Holy Spirit are present in Him, welling up
abundantly, and pouring forth upon others, while the creation remains in need of the thenceissuing
help and grace, and receives, as a mere dole, those blessings which can be passed to
it from a fellow-creature! That would be like favouritism and respecting of persons; when
we know that there is no such partiality in the nature of things, as that those existences
which differ in no way from each other on the score of substance should not have equal
power; and I think that no one who reflects will admit such views. Either He imparts nothing
to others, if He possesses nothing essentially; or, if we do believe that He does give, His
possession beforehand of that gift must be granted; this capacity of giving blessings, whilst
needing oneself no such extraneous help, is the peculiar and exquisite privilege of Deity,
and of no other.</p>
<p>Then let us look to this too. In Holy Baptism, what is it that we secure thereby? Is it not
a participation in a life no longer subject to death? I think that no one who can in any way
be reckoned amongst Christians will deny that statement. What then? Is that life-giving
power in the water itself which is employed to convey the grace of Baptism? Or is it not
rather clear to every one that this element is only employed as a means in the external
ministry, and of itself contributes nothing towards the sanctification, unless it be first
transformed itself by the sanctification; and that what gives life to the baptized is the Spirit;
as our Lord Himself says in respect to Him with His own lips, “It is the Spirit that giveth
life;” but for the completion of this grace He alone, received by faith, does not give life, but
belief in our Lord must precede, in order that the lively gift may come upon the believer, as
our Lord has spoken, “He giveth life to whom He willeth.” But further still, seeing that this
grace administered through the Son is dependent on the Ungenerate Source of all, Scripture
accordingly teaches us that belief in the Father Who engendereth all things is to come first;
so that this life-giving grace should be completed, for those fit to receive it, after starting
from that Source as from a spring pouring life abundantly, through the Only-begotten Who
is the True life, by the operation of the Holy Spirit. If, then, life comes in baptism, and baptism
receives its completion in the name of Father, Son, and Spirit, what do these men mean who
count this Minister of life as nothing? If the gift is a slight one, they must tell us the thing
that is more precious than this life. But if everything whatever that is precious is second to
this life, I mean that higher and precious life in which the brute creation has no part, how
can they dare to depreciate so great a favour, or rather the actual Being who grants the favour,
and to degrade Him in their conceptions of Him to a subject world by disjoining Him from

<pb n="602"/>
the higher world of deity1257. Finally, if they will have it that this bestowal of life is a small
thing, and that it means nothing great and awful in the nature of the Bestower, how is it
they do not draw the conclusion which this very view makes inevitable, namely, that we
must suppose, even with regard to the Only-begotten and the Father Himself, nothing great
in Their life, the same as that which we have through the Holy Spirit, supplied as it is from
the Father through the Son?</p>
<p>So that if these despisers and impugners of their very own life conceive of the gift as a
little one, and decree accordingly to slight the Being who imparts the gift, let them be made
aware that they cannot limit to one Person only their ingratitude, but must extend its profanity
beyond the Holy Spirit to the Holy Trinity Itself. For like as the grace flows down in
an unbroken stream from the Father, through the Son and the Spirit, upon the persons
worthy of it, so does this profanity return backward, and is transmitted from the Son to the
God of all the world, passing from one to the other. If, when a man is slighted, He Who sent
him is slighted (yet what a distance there was between the man and the Sender!), what
criminality1258 is thereby implied in those who thus defy the Holy Spirit! Perhaps this is the
blasphemy against our Law-giver1259 for which the judgment without remission has been
decreed; since in Him the1260 entire Being, Blessed and Divine, is insulted also. As the devout
worshipper of the Spirit sees in Him the glory of the Only-begotten, and in that sight beholds
the image of the Infinite God, and by means of that image makes an outline, upon his own
cognition1261, of the Original, so most plainly does this contemner1262 (of the Spirit),
whenever he advances any of his bold statements against the glory of the Spirit, extend, by
virtue of the same reasoning, his profanity to the Son, and beyond Him to the Father.
Therefore, those who reflect must have fear lest they perpetrate an audacity the result of
which will be the complete blotting out of the perpetrator of it; and while they exalt the
Spirit in the naming, they will even before the naming exalt Him in their thought, it being
impossible that words can mount along with thought; still when one shall have reached the

highest limit of human faculties, the utmost height and magnificence of idea to which the
mind can ever attain, even then one must believe it is far below the glory that belongs to1263
Him, according to the words in the Psalms, that “after exalting the Lord our God, even then
ye scarcely worship the footstool beneath His feet”: and the cause of this dignity being so
incomprehensible is nothing else than that He is holy.</p>
<p>If, then, every height of man’s ability falls below the grandeur of the Spirit (for that is
what the Word means in the metaphor of “footstool”), what vanity is theirs who think that
there is within themselves a power so great that it rests with them to define the amount of
value to be attributed to a being who is invaluable! And so they pronounce the Holy Spirit
unworthy of some things which are associated with the idea of value, as if their own abilities
could do far more than the Spirit, as estimated by them, is capable of. What pitiable, what
wretched madness! They understand not what they are themselves when they talk like this,
and what the Holy Spirit against Whom they insolently range themselves. Who will tell
these people that men are “a spirit that goeth forth and returneth not again1264,” built up
in their mother’s womb by means of a soiled conception, and returning all of them to a
soiled earth; inheriting a life that is likened unto grass; blooming for a little during life’s illusion1265,
and then withering away, and all the bloom upon them being shed and vanishing;
they themselves not knowing with certainty what they were before their birth, nor into what
they will be changed, their soul being ignorant of her peculiar destiny as long as she tarries
in the flesh? Such is man.</p>
<p>On the contrary the Holy Spirit is, to begin with, because of qualities that are essentially
holy, that which the Father, essentially Holy, is; and such as the Only-begotten is, such is
the Holy Spirit; then, again, He is so by virtue of life-giving, of imperishability, of unvariableness,
of everlastingness, of justice, of wisdom, of rectitude, of sovereignty, of goodness,
of power, of capacity to give all good things, and above them all life itself, and by being
everywhere, being present in each, filling the earth, residing in the heavens, shed abroad
upon supernatural Powers, filling all things according to the deserts of each, Himself remaining
full, being with all who are worthy, and yet not parted from the Holy Trinity. He ever
“searches the deep things of God,” ever “receives” from the Son, ever is being “sent,” and
yet not separated, and being “glorified,” and yet He has always had glory. It is plain, indeed,
that one who gives glory to another must be found himself in the possession of superabundant

glory; for how could one devoid of glory glorify another? Unless a thing be itself light, how
can it display the gracious gift of light? So the power to glorify could never be displayed by
one who was not himself glory1266, and honour, and majesty, and greatness. Now the Spirit
does glorify the Father and the Son. Neither does He lie Who saith, “Them that glorify Me
I glorify”1267; and “I have glorified Thee1268,” is said by our Lord to the Father; and again
He says, “Glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was1269.”
The Divine Voice answers, “I have both glorified, and will glorify again1270.” You see the
revolving circle of the glory moving from Like to Like. The Son is glorified by the Spirit; the
Father is glorified by the Son; again the Son has His glory from the Father; and the Onlybegotten
thus becomes the glory of the Spirit. For with what shall the Father be glorified,
but with the true glory of the Son: and with what again shall the Son be glorified, but with
the majesty of the Spirit? In like manner, again, Faith completes the circle, and glorifies the
Son by means of the Spirit, and the Father by means of the Son.</p>
<p>If such, then, is the greatness of the Spirit, and whatever is morally beautiful, whatever
is good, coming from God as it does through the Son, is completed by the instrumentality
of the Spirit that “worketh all in all,” why do they set themselves against their own life? Why
do they alienate themselves from the hope belonging to “such as are to be saved”? Why do
they sever themselves from their cleaving unto God? For how can any man cleave unto the
Lord unless the Spirit operates within us that union of ourselves with Him? Why do they
haggle with us about the amount of service and of worship? Why do they use that word
“worship” in an ironical sense, derogatory to a Divine and entirely Independent Being,
supposing that they desire their own salvation? We would say to them, “Your supplication
is the advantage of you who ask, and not the honouring of Him Who grants it. Why, then,
do you approach your Benefactor as if you had something to give? Or rather, why do you
refuse to name as a benefactor at all Him Who gives you your blessings, and slight the Lifegiver
while clinging to Life? Why, seeking for His sanctification, do you misconceive of the
Dispenser of the Grace of sanctification; and as to the giving of those blessings, why, not
denying that He has the power, do you deem Him not worthy to be asked to give, and fail
to take this into consideration, viz. how much greater a thing it is to give some blessing than
to be asked to give it? The asking does not unmistakably witness to greatness in him who
is asked; for it is possible that one who does not have the thing to give might be asked for

it, for the asking depends only on the will of the asker. But one who actually bestows some
blessing has thereby given undoubted evidence of a power residing in him. Why then, while
testifying to the greater thing in Him,—I mean the power to bestow everything that is
morally beautiful1271—do you deprive Him of the asking, as of something of importance;
although his asking, as we have said, is often performed in the case of those who have
nothing in their power, owing to the delusion of their devotees? For instance, the slaves of
superstition ask the idols for the objects of their wishes; but the asking does not, in this instance
of the idols, confer any glory; only people pay that attention to them owing to the
deluded expectation that they will get some one of the things they ask for, and so they do
not cease to ask. But you, persuaded as you are of what and how great things the Holy
Spirit is the Giver, do you neglect the asking them from Him, taking refuge in the law which
bids you ‘worship God and serve Him only1272?’ Well, how will you worship Him only, tell
me, when you have severed Him from His intimate union with His own Only-begotten and
His own Spirit? This worship is simply Jewish.</p>
<p>But you will say, “When I think of the Father it is the Son (alone) that I have included
as well in that term.” But tell me; when you have grasped the notion of the Son have you
not admitted therein that of the Holy Spirit too? For how can you confess the Son except
by the Holy Spirit? At what moment, then, is the Spirit in a state of separation from the Son,
so that when the Father is being worshipped, the worship of the Spirit is not included along
with that of the Son? And as regards their worship itself, what in the world do they reckon
it to be? They bestow it, as some exquisite piece of honour, upon the God over all, and
convey it over, sometimes, so as to reach the Only-begotten also; but the Holy Spirit they
regard as unworthy of such a privilege. Now, in the common parlance of mankind, that selfprostration
of inferiors upon the ground which they practise when they salute their betters
is termed worship. Thus, it was by such a posture that the patriarch Jacob, in his self-humi-
liation, seems to have wished to show his inferiority when coming to meet his brother and
to appease his wrath; for “he bowed himself to the ground,” says the Scripture, “three
times”1273; and Joseph’s brethren, as long as they knew him not, and he pretended before
them that he knew them not, by reason of the exaltation of his rank reverenced his sovereignty
with this worship; and even the great Abraham himself “bowed himself1274” “to the children
of Heth,” a stranger amongst the natives of that land, showing, I opine, by that action, how
far more powerful those natives were than sojourners. It is possible to speak of many such
actions both in the ancient records, and from examples before our eyes in the world now1275.</p>

<pb n="606"/>
<p>Do they too, then, mean this by their worship? Well, is it anything but absurdity to think
that it is wrong to honour the Holy Spirit with that with which the patriarch honoured even
Canaanites? Or do they consider their “worship” something different to this, as if one sort
were fitting for men, another sort for the Supreme Being? But then, how is it that they omit
worship altogether in the instance of the Spirit, not even bestowing upon Him the worship
conceded in the case of men? And what kind of worship do they imagine to be reserved especially
for the Deity? Is it to be spoken word, or acted gesture? Well, but are not these
marks of honour shared by men as well? In their case words are spoken and gestures acted.
Is it not, then, plain to every one who possesses the least amount of reflection, that any gift
worthy of the Deity mankind has not got to give; for the Author of all blessings has no need
of us. But it is we men who have transferred these indications of respect and admiration,
which we adopt towards each other, when we would show by the acknowledgment of a
neighbour’s superiority that one of us is in a humbler position than another, to our attendance
upon a Higher Power; out of our possessions we make a gift of what is most precious to a
priceless Nature. Therefore, since men, approaching emperors and potentates for the objects
which they wish in some way to obtain from those rulers, do not bring to them their mere
petition only, but employ every possible means to induce them to feel pity and favour towards
themselves, adopting a humble voice, and a kneeling position1276, clasping their knees,
prostrating themselves on the ground, and putting forward to plead for their petition all
sorts of pathetic signs, to wake that pity,—so it is that those who recognize the True Potentate,
by Whom all things in existence are controlled, when they are supplicating for that which
they have at heart, some lowly in spirit because of pitiable conditions in this world, some
with their thoughts lifted up because of their eternal mysterious hopes, seeing that they
know not how to ask, and that their humanity is not capable of displaying any reverence
that can reach to the grandeur of that Glory, carry the ceremonial used in the case of men
into the service of the Deity. And this is what “worship” is,—that, I mean, which is offered
for objects we have at heart along with supplication and humiliation. Therefore Daniel too
bends the knees to the Lord, when asking His love for the captive people; and He Who “bare
our sicknesses,” and intercedes for us, is recorded in the Gospel to have fallen on His face,
because of the man that He had taken upon Him, at the hour of prayer, and in this posture
<note type="footnote">1276 Still the word προσκυνεῖν became consecrated to the highest Christian worship while θεραπεύειν was

to have made His petition, enjoining thereby, I think, that at the time of our petition our
voice is not to be bold, but that we are to assume the attitude of the wretched; since the Lord
“resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble;” and somewhere else (He says), “he
that exalteth himself shall be abased.” If, then, “worship” is a sort of suppliant state, or
pleading put forward for the object of the petition, what is the intention of these new-fashioned
regulations? These men do not even deign to ask of the Giver, nor to kneel to the
Ruler, nor to attend upon the Potentate.</p>

<p>All you who study medicine have, one may say, humanity for your profession: and I
think that one who preferred your science to all the serious pursuits of life would form the
proper judgment, and not miss the right decision, if it be true that life, the most valued of
all things, is a thing to be shunned, and full of pain, if it may not be had with health, and
health your art supplies. But in your own case the science is in a notable degree of double
efficacy; you enlarge for yourself the bounds of its humanity, since you do not limit the benefit
of your art to men’s bodies, but take thought also for the cure of troubles of the mind.
I say this, not only following the common reports, but because I have learnt it from experience,
as in many other matters, so especially at this time in this indescribable malice of our
enemies, which you skilfully dispersed when it swept like some evil flood over our life, dispelling
this violent inflammation of our heart by your fomentation of soothing words. I
thought it right, indeed, in view of the continuous and varied effort of our enemies against
us, to keep silence, and to receive their attack quietly, rather than to speak against men
armed with falsehood, that most mischievous weapon, which sometimes drives its point
even through truth. But you did well in urging me not to betray the truth, but to refute the
slanderers, lest, by a success of falsehood against truth, many might be injured.</p>
<p>I may say that those who conceived this causeless hatred for us seemed to be acting very
much on the principle of Æsop’s fable. For just as he makes his wolf bring some charges
against the lamb (feeling ashamed, I suppose, of seeming to destroy, without just pretext,
one who had done him no hurt), and then, when the lamb easily swept away all the slanderous
charges brought against him, makes the wolf by no means slacken his attack, but carry the
day with his teeth when he is vanquished by justice; so those who were as keen for hatred
against us as if it were something good (feeling perhaps some shame of seeming to hate
without cause), make up charges and complaints against us, while they do not abide consistently
by any of the things they say, but allege, now that one thing, after a little while that
another, and then again that something else is the cause of their hostility to us. Their malice
does not take a stand on any ground, but when they are dislodged from one charge they

the argument considerably clearer than it is if they are excluded, as they are from the Benedictine text of S. Basil.</note>

<pb n="609"/>
cling to another, and from that again they seize upon a third, and if all their charges are refuted
they do not give up their hate. They charge us with preaching three Gods, and din
into the ears of the multitude this slander, which they never rest from maintaining persuasively.
Then truth fights on our side, for we show both publicly to all men, and privately to
those who converse with us, that we anathematize any man who says that there are three
Gods, and hold him to be not even a Christian. Then, as soon as they hear this, they find
Sabellius a handy weapon against us, and the plague that he spread is the subject of continual
attacks upon us. Once more, we oppose to this assault our wonted armour of truth, and
show that we abhor this form of heresy just as much as Judaism. What then? are they weary
after such efforts, and content to rest? Not at all. Now they charge us with innovation, and
frame their complaint against us in this way:—They allege that while we confess1278 three
Persons we say that there is one goodness, and one power, and one Godhead. And in this
assertion they do not go beyond the truth; for we do say so. But the ground of their complaint
is that their custom does not admit this, and Scripture does not support it. What then is our
reply? We do not think that it is right to make their prevailing custom the law and rule of
sound doctrine. For if custom is to avail for1279 proof of soundness, we too, surely, may
advance our prevailing custom; and if they reject this, we are surely not bound to follow
theirs. Let the inspired Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will surely be
given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the Divine words.</p>
<p>Well, what is their charge? There are two brought forward together in the accusation
against us; one, that we divide the Persons; the other, that we do not employ any of the
names which belong to God in the plural number, but (as I said already) speak of the
goodness as one, and of the power, and the Godhead, and all such attributes in the singular.
With regard to the dividing of the Persons, those cannot well object who hold the doctrine
of the diversity of substances in the Divine nature. For it is not to be supposed that those
who say that there are three substances do not also say that there are three Persons. So this
point only is called in question: that those attributes which are ascribed to the Divine nature

<p>But our argument in reply to this is ready and clear. For any one who condemns those
who say that the Godhead is one, must necessarily support either those who say that there
are more than one, or those who say that there is none. But the inspired teaching does not
allow us to say that there are more than one, since, whenever it uses the term, it makes
mention of the Godhead in the singular; as,—“In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the God-

head1280”; and, elsewhere,—“The invisible things of Him from the foundation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead1281.” If, then, to extend the number of the Godhead to a multitude belongs to
those only who suffer from the plague of polytheistic error, and on the other hand utterly
to deny the Godhead would be the doctrine of atheists, what doctrine is that which accuses
us for saying that the Godhead is one? But they reveal more clearly the aim of their argument.
As regards the Father, they admit the fact that He is God1282, and that the Son likewise is
honoured with the attribute of Godhead; but the Spirit, Who is reckoned with the Father
and the Son, they cannot include in their conception of Godhead, but hold that the power
of the Godhead, issuing from the Father to the Son, and there halting, separates the nature
of the Spirit from the Divine glory. And so, as far as we may in a short space, we have to
answer this opinion also.</p>
<p>What, then, is our doctrine? The Lord, in delivering the saving Faith to those who become
disciples of the word, joins with the Father and the Son the Holy Spirit also; and we affirm
that the union of that which has once been joined is continual; for it is not joined in one
thing, and separated in others. But the power of the Spirit, being included with the Father
and the Son in the life-giving power, by which our nature is transferred from the corruptible
life to immortality, and in many other cases also, as in the conception of “Good,” and “Holy,”
and “Eternal,” “Wise,” “Righteous,” “Chief,” “Mighty,” and in fact everywhere, has an inseparable
association with them in all the attributes ascribed in a sense of special excellence.
And so we consider that it is right to think that that which is joined to the Father and the
Son in such sublime and exalted conceptions is not separated from them in any. For we do
not know of any differences by way of superiority and inferiority in attributes which express
our conceptions of the Divine nature, so that we should suppose it an act of piety (while allowing
to the Spirit community in the inferior attributes) to judge Him unworthy of those
more exalted. For all the Divine attributes, whether named or conceived, are of like rank
one with another, in that they are not distinguishable in respect of the signification of their
subject. For the appellation of “the Good” does not lead our minds to one subject, and that
of “the Wise,” or “the Mighty,” or “the Righteous” to another, but the thing to which all the
attributes point is one; and, if you speak of God, you signify the same Whom you understood
by the other attributes. If then all the attributes ascribed to the Divine nature are of equal
force as regards their designation of the subject, leading our minds to the same subject in
various aspects, what reason is there that one, while allowing to the Spirit community with
the Father and the Son in the other attributes, should exclude Him from the Godhead alone?

It is absolutely necessary either to allow to Him community in this also, or not to admit His
community in the others. For if He is worthy in the case of those attributes, He is surely not
less worthy in this. But if He is “less,” according to their phrase1283, so that He is excluded
from community with the Father and the Son in the attribute of Godhead, neither is He
worthy to share in any other of the attributes which belong to God. For the attributes, when
rightly understood and mutually compared by that notion which we contemplate in each
case, will be found to imply nothing less than the appellation of “God.” And a proof of this
is that many even of the inferior existences are called by this very name. Further, the Divine
Scripture is not sparing in this use of the name even in the case of things incongruous, as
when it names idols by the appellation of God. For it says, “Let the gods that have not made
the heavens and the earth perish, and be cast down beneath the earth1284”; and, “all the gods
of the heathen are devils1285”; and the witch in her incantations, when she brings up for
Saul the spirits that he sought for, says that she “saw gods1286.” And again Balaam, being
an augur and a seer, and engaging in divination, and having obtained for himself the instruction
of devils and magical augury, is said in Scripture to receive counsel from God1287. One
may show by collecting many instances of the same kind from the Divine Scripture, that
this attribute has no supremacy over the other attributes which are proper to God, seeing
that, as has been said, we find it predicated, in an equivocal sense, even of things incongruous;
but we are nowhere taught in Scripture that the names of “the Holy,” “the Incorruptible,”
“the Righteous,” “the Good,” are made common to things unworthy. If, then, they do not
deny that the Holy Spirit has community with the Father and the Son in those attributes
which, in their sense of special excellence, are piously predicated only of the Divine nature,
what reason is there to pretend that He is excluded from community in this only, wherein
it was shown that, by an equivocal use, even devils and idols share?</p>
<p>But they say that this appellation is indicative of nature, and that, as the nature of the
Spirit is not common to the Father and the Son, for this reason neither does he partake in
the community of this attribute. Let them show, then, whereby they discern this diversity
of nature. For if it were possible that the Divine nature should be contemplated in its absolute

essence, and that we should find by appearances what is and what is not proper to it, we
should surely have no need of other arguments or evidence for the comprehension of the
question. But since it is exalted above the understanding of the questioners, and we have to
argue from some particular evidence about those things which evade our knowledge1288,
it is absolutely necessary for us to be guided to the investigation of the Divine nature by its
operations. If, then, we see that the operations which are wrought by the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit differ one from the other, we shall conjecture from the different character
of the operations that the natures which operate are also different. For it cannot be that
things which differ in their very nature should agree in the form of their operation: fire does
not chill, nor ice give warmth, but their operations are distinguished together with the difference
between their natures. If, on the other hand, we understand that the operation of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one, differing or varying in nothing, the oneness
of their nature must needs be inferred from the identity of their operation. The Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit alike give sanctification, and life, and light, and comfort, and all
similar graces. And let no one attribute the power of sanctification in an especial sense to
the Spirit, when he hears the Saviour in the Gospel saying to the Father concerning His
disciples, “Father, sanctify them in Thy name1289.” So too all the other gifts are wrought in
those who are worthy alike by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit: every grace and
power, guidance, life, comfort, the change to immortality, the passage to liberty, and every
other boon that exists, which descends to us.</p>
<p>But the order of things which is above us, alike in the region of intelligence and in that
of sense (if by what we know we may form conjectures about those things also which are
above us), is itself established within the operation and power of the Holy Spirit, every man
receiving the benefit according to his own desert and need. For although the arrangement
and ordering of things above our nature is obscure to our sense, yet one may more reasonably
infer, by the things which we know, that in them too the power of the Spirit works, than
that it is banished from the order existing in the things above us. For he who asserts the
latter view advances his blasphemy in a naked and unseemly shape, without being able to
support his absurd opinion by any argument. But he who agrees that those things which
are above us are also ordered by the power of the Spirit with the Father and the Son, makes

his assertion on this point with the support of clear evidence from his own life. For1290 as
the nature of man is compounded of body and soul, and the angelic nature has for its portion
life without a body, if the Holy Spirit worked only in the case of bodies, and the soul were
not capable of receiving the grace that comes from Him, one might perhaps infer from this,
if the intellectual and incorporeal nature which is in us were above the power of the Spirit,
that the angelic life too was in no need of His grace. But if the gift of the Holy Spirit is
principally a grace of the soul, and the constitution of the soul is linked by its intellectuality
and invisibility to the angelic life, what person who knows how to see a consequence would
not agree, that every intellectual nature is governed by the ordering of the Holy Spirit? For
since it is said “the angels do alway behold the Face of My Father which is in heaven1291,”
and it is not possible to behold the person of the Father otherwise than by fixing the sight
upon it through His image; and the image of the person of the Father is the Only-begotten,
and to Him again no man can draw near whose mind has not been illumined by the Holy
Spirit, what else is shown from this but that the Holy Spirit is not separated from any operation
which is wrought by the Father and the Son? Thus the identity of operation in Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit shows plainly the undistinguishable character of their substance. So
that even if the name of Godhead does indicate nature, the community of substance shows
that this appellation is properly applied also to the Holy Spirit. But I know not how these
makers-up of all sorts of arguments bring the appellation of Godhead to be an indication
of nature, as though they had not heard from the Scripture that it is a matter of appointment1292,
in which way nature does not arise. For Moses was appointed as a god of the
Egyptians, since He Who gave him the oracles, U+0026c., spoke thus to him, “I have given thee
as a god to Pharaoh1293.” Thus the force of the appellation is the indication of some power,
either of oversight or of operation. But the Divine nature itself, as it is, remains unexpressed
by all the names that are conceived for it, as our doctrine declares. For in learning that He
is beneficent, and a judge, good, and just, and all else of the same kind, we learn diversities
of His operations, but we are none the more able to learn by our knowledge of His operations

seems to be that “Godhead” is spoken of in Scripture as being given by appointment, which excludes the idea
of its being indicative of “nature.” Gregory shows that it is so spoken of; but he does not show that Scripture
asserts the distinction between nature and appointment, which the reading of the Benedictine text and Oehler
would require him to do.</note>

the nature of Him Who works. For when one gives a definition of any one of these attributes,
and of the nature to which the names are applied, he will not give the same definition of
both: and of things of which the definition is different, the nature also is distinct. Indeed
the substance is one thing which no definition has been found to express, and the significance
of the names employed concerning it varies, as the names are given from some operation
or accident. Now the fact that there is no distinction in the operations we learn from the
community of the attributes, but of the difference in respect of nature we find no clear proof,
the identity of operations indicating rather, as we said, community of nature. If, then,
Godhead is a name derived from operation, as we say that the operation of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one, so we say that the Godhead is one: or if, according to
the view of the majority, Godhead is indicative of nature, since we cannot find any diversity
in their nature, we not unreasonably define the Holy Trinity to be of one Godhead1294.</p>
<p>But if any one were to call this appellation indicative of dignity, I cannot tell by what
reasoning he drags the word to this significance. Since however one may hear many saying
things of this kind, in order that the zeal of its opponents may not find a ground for attacking
the truth, we go out of our way with those who take this view, to consider such an opinion,
and say that, even if the name does denote dignity, in this case too the appellation will
properly befit the Holy Spirit. For the attribute of kingship denotes all dignity; and “our
God,” it says, “is King from everlasting1295.” But the Son, having all things which are the
Father’s, is Himself proclaimed a King by Holy Scripture. Now the Divine Scripture says
that the Holy Spirit is the unction of the Only-Begotten1296, interpreting the dignity of the
Spirit by a transference of the terms commonly used in this world. For as, in ancient days,
in those who were advanced to kingship, the token of this dignity was the unction which
was applied to them, and when this took place there was thenceforth a change from private
and humble estate to the superiority of rule, and he who was deemed worthy of this grace
received after his anointing another name, being called, instead of an ordinary man, the
Anointed of the Lord: for this reason, that the dignity of the Holy Spirit might be more
clearly shown to men, He was called by the Scripture “the sign of the Kingdom,” and
“Unction,” whereby we are taught that the Holy Spirit shares in the glory and kingdom of
the Only-begotten Son of God. For as in Israel it was not permitted to enter upon the kingdom
without the unction being previously given, so the word, by a transference of the terms
in use among ourselves, indicates the equality of power, showing that not even the kingdom
of the Son is received without the dignity of the Holy Spirit. And for this reason He is
properly called Christ, since this name gives the proof of His inseparable and indivisible

conjunction with the Holy Spirit. If, then, the Only-begotten God is the Anointed, and the
Holy Spirit is His Unction, and the appellation of Anointed1297 points to the Kingly authority,
and the anointing is the token of His Kingship, then the Holy Spirit shares also in His dignity.
If, therefore, they say that the attribute of Godhead is significative of dignity, and the Holy
Spirit is shown to share in this last quality, it follows that He Who partakes in the dignity
will also partake in the name which represents it.</p>

<head>On “Not Three Gods.”</head>
<head>To Ablabius.</head>
<p>Ye that are strong with all might in the inner man ought by rights to carry on the struggle
against the enemies of the truth, and not to shrink from the task, that we fathers may be
gladdened by the noble toil of our sons; for this is the prompting of the law of nature: but
as you turn your ranks, and send against us the assaults of those darts which are hurled by
the opponents of the truth, and demand that their “hot burning coals”1298 and their shafts
sharpened by knowledge falsely so called should be quenched with the shield of faith by us
old men, we accept your command, and make ourselves an example of obedience1299, in
order that you may yourself give us the just requital on like commands, Ablabius, noble
soldier of Christ, if we should ever summon you to such a contest.</p>
<p>In truth, the question you propound to us is no small one, nor such that but small harm
will follow if it meets with insufficient treatment. For by the force of the question, we are at
first sight compelled to accept one or other of two erroneous opinions, and either to say
“there are three Gods,” which is unlawful, or not to acknowledge the Godhead of the Son
and the Holy Spirit, which is impious and absurd.</p>
<p>The argument which you state is something like this:—Peter, James, and John, being
in one human nature, are called three men: and there is no absurdity in describing those
who are united in nature, if they are more than one, by the plural number of the name derived
from their nature. If, then, in the above case, custom admits this, and no one forbids us to
speak of those who are two as two, or those who are more than two as three, how is it that
in the case of our statements of the mysteries of the Faith, though confessing the Three
Persons, and acknowledging no difference of nature between them, we are in some sense
at variance with our confession, when we say that the Godhead of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost is one, and yet forbid men to say “there are three Gods”? The question
is, as I said, very difficult to deal with: yet, if we should be able to find anything that may
give support to the uncertainty of our mind, so that it may no longer totter and waver in
this monstrous dilemma, it would be well: on the other hand, even if our reasoning be found
unequal to the problem, we must keep for ever, firm and unmoved, the tradition which we
received by succession from the fathers, and seek from the Lord the reason which is the
advocate of our faith: and if this be found by any of those endowed with grace, we must give

thanks to Him who bestowed the grace; but if not, we shall none the less, on those points
which have been determined, hold our faith unchangeably.</p>
<p>What, then, is the reason that when we count one by one those who are exhibited to us
in one nature, we ordinarily name them in the plural and speak of “so many men,” instead
of calling them all one: while in the case of the Divine nature our doctrinal definition rejects
the plurality of Gods, at once enumerating the Persons, and at the same time not admitting
the plural signification? Perhaps one might seem to touch the point if he were to say
(speaking offhand to straightforward people), that the definition refused to reckon Gods in
any number to avoid any resemblance to the polytheism of the heathen, lest, if we too were
to enumerate the Deity, not in the singular, but in the plural, as they are accustomed to do,
there might be supposed to be also some community of doctrine. This answer, I say, if made
to people of a more guileless spirit, might seem to be of some weight: but in the case of the
others who require that one of the alternatives they propose should be established (either
that we should not acknowledge the Godhead in Three Persons, or that, if we do, we should
speak of those who share in the same Godhead as three), this answer is not such as to furnish
any solution of the difficulty. And hence we must needs make our reply at greater length,
tracing out the truth as best we may; for the question is no ordinary one.</p>
<p>We say, then, to begin with, that the practice of calling those who are not divided1300
in nature by the very name of their common nature in the plural, and saying they are “many
men,” is a customary abuse of language, and that it would be much the same thing to say
they are “many human natures.” And the truth of this we may see from the following instance.
When we address any one, we do not call him by the name of his nature, in order that no
confusion may result from the community of the name, as would happen if every one of
those who hear it were to think that he himself was the person addressed, because the call
is made not by the proper appellation but by the common name of their nature: but we
separate him from the multitude by using that name which belongs to him as his own;—that,
I mean, which signifies the particular subject. Thus there are many who have shared in the
nature—many disciples, say, or apostles, or martyrs—but the man in them all is one; since,
as has been said, the term “man” does not belong to the nature of the individual as such,
but to that which is common. For Luke is a man, or Stephen is a man; but it does not follow
that if any one is a man he is therefore Luke or Stephen: but the idea of the persons admits
of that separation which is made by the peculiar attributes considered in each severally, and
when they are combined is presented to us by means of number; yet their nature is one, at
union in itself, and an absolutely indivisible unit, not capable of increase by addition or of
diminution by subtraction, but in its essence being and continually remaining one, insepar-

able even though it appear in plurality, continuous, complete, and not divided with the individuals
who participate in it. And as we speak of a people, or a mob, or an army, or an
assembly in the singular in every case, while each of these is conceived as being in plurality,
so according to the more accurate expression, “man” would be said to be one, even though
those who are exhibited to us in the same nature make up a plurality. Thus it would be much
better to correct our erroneous habit, so as no longer to extend to a plurality the name of
the nature, than by our bondage to habit to transfer1301 to our statements concerning God
the error which exists in the above case. But since the correction of the habit is impracticable
(for how could you persuade any one not to speak of those who are exhibited in the same
nature as “many men”?—indeed, in every case habit is a thing hard to change), we are not
so far wrong in not going contrary to the prevailing habit in the case of the lower nature,
since no harm results from the mistaken use of the name: but in the case of the statement
concerning the Divine nature the various use1302 of terms is no longer so free from danger:
for that which is of small account is in these subjects no longer a small matter. Therefore
we must confess one God, according to the testimony of Scripture, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord
thy God is one Lord,” even though the name of Godhead extends through the Holy Trinity.
This I say according to the account we have given in the case of human nature, in which we
have learnt that it is improper to extend the name of the nature by the mark of plurality.
We must, however, more carefully examine the name of “Godhead,” in order to obtain, by
means of the significance involved in the word, some help towards clearing up the question
before us.</p>
<p>Most men think that the word “Godhead” is used in a peculiar degree in respect of
nature: and just as the heaven, or the sun, or any other of the constituent parts of the universe
are denoted by proper names which are significant of the subjects, so they say that in the
case of the Supreme and Divine nature, the word “Godhead” is fitly adapted to that which
it represents to us, as a kind of special name. We, on the other hand, following the suggestions
of Scripture, have learnt that that nature is unnameable and unspeakable, and we say that
every term either invented by the custom1303 of men, or handed down to us by the Scriptures,
is indeed explanatory of our conceptions of the Divine Nature1304, but does not include the
signification of that nature itself. And it may be shown without much difficulty that this is
the case. For all other terms which are used of the creation may be found, even without

analysis of their origin, to be applied to the subjects accidentally, because we are content to
denote the things in any way by the word applied to them so as to avoid confusion in our
knowledge of the things signified. But all the terms that are employed to lead us to the
knowledge of God have comprehended in them each its own meaning, and you cannot find
any word among the terms especially applied to God which is without a distinct sense. Hence
it is clear that by any of the terms we use the Divine nature itself is not signified, but some
one of its surroundings is made known. For we say, it may be, that the Deity is incorruptible,
or powerful, or whatever else we are accustomed to say of Him. But in each of these terms
we find a peculiar sense, fit to be understood or asserted of the Divine nature, yet not expressing
that which that nature is in its essence. For the subject, whatever it may be, is incorruptible:
but our conception of incorruptibility is this,—that that which is, is not resolved
into decay: so, when we say that He is incorruptible, we declare what His nature does not
suffer, but we do not express what that is which does not suffer corruption. Thus, again, if
we say that He is the Giver of life, though we show by that appellation what He gives, we
do not by that word declare what that is which gives it. And by the same reasoning we find
that all else which results from the significance involved in the names expressing the Divine
attributes either forbids us to conceive what we ought not to conceive of the Divine nature,
or teaches us that which we ought to conceive of it, but does not include an explanation of
the nature itself. Since, then, as we perceive the varied operations of the power above us, we
fashion our appellations from the several operations that are known to us, and as we recognize
as one of these that operation of surveying and inspection, or, as one might call it, beholding,
whereby He surveys all things and overlooks them all, discerning our thoughts, and even
entering by His power of contemplation into those things which are not visible, we suppose
that Godhead, or θεότης, is so called from θέα, or beholding, and that He who is our θεατής
or beholder, by customary use and by the instruction of the Scriptures, is called θεός, or
God. Now if any one admits that to behold and to discern are the same thing, and that the
God Who superintends all things, both is and is called the superintender of the universe,
let him consider this operation, and judge whether it belongs to one of the Persons whom
we believe in the Holy Trinity, or whether the power extends1305 throughout the Three
Persons. For if our interpretation of the term Godhead, or θεότης, is a true one, and the
things which are seen are said to be beheld, or θεατά, and that which beholds them is called
θεός, or God, no one of the Persons in the Trinity could reasonably be excluded from such
an appellation on the ground of the sense involved in the word. For Scripture attributes the
act of seeing equally to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. David says, “See, O God our defender1306”:
and from this we learn that sight is a proper operation of the idea1307 of God, so far

it says, “Jesus, seeing their thoughts1308.” And of the Holy Spirit also, Peter says to Ananias,
“Why hath Satan filled thine heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost?1309” showing that the Holy
Spirit was a true witness, aware of what Ananias had dared to do in secret, and by Whom
the manifestation of the secret was made to Peter. For Ananias became a thief of his own
goods, secretly, as he thought, from all men, and concealing his sin: but the Holy Spirit at
the same moment was in Peter, and detected his intent, dragged down as it was to avarice,
and gave to Peter from Himself1310 the power of seeing the secret, while it is clear that He
could not have done this had He not been able to behold hidden things.</p>
<p>But some one will say that the proof of our argument does not yet regard the question.
For even if it were granted that the name of “Godhead” is a common name of the nature, it
would not be established that we should not speak of “Gods”: but by these arguments, on
the contrary, we are compelled to speak of “Gods”: for we find in the custom of mankind
that not only those who are partakers1311 in the same nature, but even any who may be of
the same business, are not, when they are many, spoken of in the singular; as we speak of
“many orators,” or “surveyors,” or “farmers,” or “shoemakers,” and so in all other cases. If,
indeed, Godhead were an appellation of nature, it would be more proper, according to the
argument laid down, to include the Three Persons in the singular number, and to speak of
“One God,” by reason of the inseparability and indivisibility of the nature: but since it has
been established by what has been said, that the term “Godhead” is significant of operation,
and not of nature, the argument from what has been advanced seems to turn to the contrary
conclusion, that we ought therefore all the more to call those “three Gods” who are contemplated
in the same operation, as they say that one would speak of “three philosophers” or
“orators,” or any other name derived from a business when those who take part in the same
business are more than one.</p>
<p>I have taken some pains, in setting forth this view, to bring forward the reasoning on
behalf of the adversaries, that our decision may be the more firmly fixed, being strengthened
by the more elaborate contradictions. Let us now resume our argument.</p>
<p>As we have to a certain extent shown by our statement that the word “Godhead” is not
significant of nature but of operation, perhaps one might reasonably allege as a cause why,
in the case of men, those who share with one another in the same pursuits are enumerated
and spoken of in the plural, while on the other hand the Deity is spoken of in the singular

as one God and one Godhead, even though the Three Persons are not separated from the
significance expressed by the term “Godhead,”—one might allege, I say, the fact that men,
even if several are engaged in the same form of action, work separately each by himself at
the task he has undertaken, having no participation in his individual action with others who
are engaged in the same occupation. For instance, supposing the case of several rhetoricians,
their pursuit, being one, has the same name in the numerous cases: but each of those who
follow it works by himself, this one pleading on his own account, and that on his own account.
Thus, since among men the action of each in the same pursuits is discriminated, they are
properly called many, since each of them is separated from the others within his own environment,
according to the special character of his operation. But in the case of the Divine
nature we do not similarly learn that the Father does anything by Himself in which the Son
does not work conjointly, or again that the Son has any special operation apart from the
Holy Spirit; but every operation which extends from God to the Creation, and is named
according to our variable conceptions of it, has its origin from the Father, and proceeds
through the Son, and is perfected in the Holy Spirit. For this reason the name derived from
the operation is not divided with regard to the number of those who fulfil it, because the
action of each concerning anything is not separate and peculiar, but whatever comes to pass,
in reference either to the acts of His providence for us, or to the government and constitution
of the universe, comes to pass by the action of the Three, yet what does come to pass is not
three things. We may understand the meaning of this from one single instance. From Him,
I say, Who is the chief source of gifts, all things which have shared in this grace have obtained
their life. When we inquire, then, whence this good gift came to us, we find by the guidance
of the Scriptures that it was from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet although we set forth
Three Persons and three names, we do not consider that we have had bestowed upon us
three lives, one from each Person separately; but the same life is wrought in us by the Father,
and prepared by the Son, and depends on the will of the Holy Spirit. Since then the Holy
Trinity fulfils every operation in a manner similar to that of which I have spoken, not by
separate action according to the number of the Persons, but so that there is one motion and
disposition of the good will which is communicated from the Father through the Son to the
Spirit (for as we do not call those whose operation gives one life three Givers of life, neither
do we call those who are contemplated in one goodness three Good beings, nor speak of
them in the plural by any of their other attributes); so neither can we call those who exercise
this Divine and superintending power and operation towards ourselves and all creation,
conjointly and inseparably, by their mutual action, three Gods. For as when we learn concerning
the God of the universe, from the words of Scripture, that He judges all the earth1312,
we say that He is the Judge of all things through the Son: and again, when we hear that the
<note type="footnote">1312 Rom. iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="622"/>
Father judgeth no man1313, we do not think that the Scripture is at variance with itself,—(for
He Who judges all the earth does this by His Son to Whom He has committed all judgment;
and everything which is done by the Only-begotten has its reference to the Father, so that
He Himself is at once the Judge of all things and judges no man, by reason of His having,
as we said, committed all judgment to the Son, while all the judgment of the Son is conformable
to the will of the Father; and one could not properly say either that They are two judges,
or that one of Them is excluded from the authority and power implied in judgment);—so
also in the case of the word “Godhead,” Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God,
and that very power of superintendence and beholding which we call Godhead, the Father
exercises through the Only-begotten, while the Son perfects every power by the Holy Spirit,
judging, as Isaiah says, by the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning1314, and acting
by Him also, according to the saying in the Gospel which was spoken to the Jews. For He
says, “If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils1315”; where He includes every form of doing
good in a partial description, by reason of the unity of action: for the name derived from
operation cannot be divided among many where the result of their mutual operation is one.</p>
<p>Since, then, the character of the superintending and beholding power is one, in Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, as has been said in our previous argument, issuing from the Father as
from a spring, brought into operation by the Son, and perfecting its grace by the power of
the Spirit; and since no operation is separated in respect of the Persons, being fulfilled by
each individually apart from that which is joined with Him in our contemplation, but all
providence, care, and superintendence of all, alike of things in the sensible creation and of
those of supramundane nature, and that power which preserves the things which are, and
corrects those which are amiss, and instructs those which are ordered aright, is one, and
not three, being, indeed, directed by the Holy Trinity, yet not severed by a threefold division
according to the number of the Persons contemplated in the Faith, so that each of the acts,
contemplated by itself, should be the work of the Father alone, or of the Son peculiarly, or
of the Holy Spirit1316 separately, but while, as the Apostle says, the one and the selfsame
Spirit divides His good gifts to every man severally1317, the motion of good proceeding from
the Spirit is not without beginning;—we find that the power which we conceive as preceding
this motion, which is the Only-begotten God, is the maker of all things; without Him no
existent thing attains to the beginning of its being: and, again, this same source of good issues
from the will of the Father.</p>

<pb n="623"/>
<p>If, then, every good thing and every good name, depending on that power and purpose
which is without beginning, is brought to perfection in the power of the Spirit through the
Only-begotten God, without mark of time or distinction (since there is no delay, existent
or conceived, in the motion of the Divine will from the Father, through the Son, to the
Spirit): and if Godhead also is one of the good names and concepts, it would not be proper
to divide the name into a plurality, since the unity existing in the action prevents plural
enumeration. And as the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe1318, is spoken of
by the Apostle as one, and no one from this phrase argues either that the Son does not save
them who believe, or that salvation is given to those who receive it without the intervention
of the Spirit; but God who is over all, is the Saviour of all, while the Son works salvation by
means of the grace of the Spirit, and yet they are not on this account called in Scripture three
Saviours (although salvation is confessed to proceed from the Holy Trinity): so neither are
they called three Gods, according to the signification assigned to the term “Godhead,” even
though the aforesaid appellation attaches to the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>It does not seem to me absolutely necessary, with a view to the present proof of our argument,
to contend against those who oppose us with the assertion that we are not to conceive
“Godhead” as an operation. For we, believing the Divine nature to be unlimited and incomprehensible,
conceive no comprehension of it, but declare that the nature is to be conceived
in all respects as infinite: and that which is absolutely infinite is not limited in one respect
while it is left unlimited in another, but infinity is free from limitation altogether. That
therefore which is without limit is surely not limited even by name. In order then to mark
the constancy of our conception of infinity in the case of the Divine nature, we say that the
Deity is above every name: and “Godhead” is a name. Now it cannot be that the same thing
should at once be a name and be accounted as above every name.</p>
<p>But if it pleases our adversaries to say that the significance of the term is not operation,
but nature, we shall fall back upon our original argument, that custom applies the name of
a nature to denote multitude erroneously: since according to true reasoning neither diminution
nor increase attaches to any nature, when it is contemplated in a larger or smaller
number. For it is only those things which are contemplated in their individual circumscription
which are enumerated by way of addition. Now this circumscription is noted by bodily
appearance, and size, and place, and difference figure and colour, and that which is contemplated
apart from these conditions is free from the circumscription which is formed by such
categories. That which is not thus circumscribed is not enumerated, and that which is not
enumerated cannot be contemplated in multitude. For we say that gold, even though it be
cut into many figures, is one, and is so spoken of, but we speak of many coins or many
staters, without finding any multiplication of the nature of gold by the number of staters;
<note type="footnote">1318 1 Tim. iv. 10.</note>

<pb n="624"/>
and for this reason we speak of gold, when it is contemplated in greater bulk, either in plate
or in coin, as “much,” but we do not speak of it as “many golds” on account of the multitude
of the material,—except when one says there are “many gold pieces” (Darics, for instance,
or staters), in which case it is not the material, but the pieces of money to which the significance
of number applies: indeed, properly, we should not call them “gold” but “golden.”</p>
<p>As, then, the golden staters are many, but the gold is one, so too those who are exhibited
to us severally in the nature of man, as Peter, James, and John, are many, yet the man in
them is one. And although Scripture extends the word according to the plural significance,
where it says “men swear by the greater1319,” and “sons of men,” and in other phrases of
the like sort, we must recognize that in using the custom of the prevailing form of speech,
it does not lay down a law as to the propriety of using the words in one way or another, nor
does it say these things by way of giving us instruction about phrases, but uses the word
according to the prevailing custom, with a view only to this, that the word may be profitable
to those who receive it, taking no minute care in its manner of speech about points where
no harm can result from the phrases in respect of the way they are understood.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be a lengthy task to set out in detail from the Scriptures those constructions
which are inexactly expressed, in order to prove the statement I have made; where,
however, there is a risk of injury to any part of the truth, we no longer find in Scriptural
phrases any indiscriminate or indifferent use of words. For this reason Scripture admits the
naming of “men” in the plural, because no one is by such a figure of speech led astray in his
conceptions to imagine a multitude of humanities, or supposes that many human natures
are indicated by the fact that the name expressive of that nature is used in the plural. But
the word “God” it employs studiously in the singular form only, guarding against introducing
the idea of different natures in the Divine essence by the plural signification of “Gods.” This
is the cause why it says, “the Lord our God is one Lord1320,” and also proclaims the Onlybegotten
God by the name of Godhead, without dividing the Unity into a dual signification,
so as to call the Father and the Son two Gods, although each is proclaimed by the holy writers
as God. The Father is God: the Son is God: and yet by the same proclamation God is One,
because no difference either of nature or of operation is contemplated in the Godhead. For
if (according to the idea of those who have been led astray) the nature of the Holy Trinity
were diverse, the number would by consequence be extended to a plurality of Gods, being
divided according to the diversity of essence in the subjects. But since the Divine, single,
and unchanging nature, that it may be one, rejects all diversity in essence, it does not admit
in its own case the signification of multitude; but as it is called one nature, so it is called in
the singular by all its other names, “God,” “Good,” “Holy,” “Saviour,” “Just,” “Judge,” and
<note type="footnote">1319 Heb. vi. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">1320 Deut. vi. 4.</note>

<pb n="625"/>
every other Divine name conceivable: whether one says that the names refer to nature or to
operation, we shall not dispute the point.</p>
<p>If, however, any one cavils at our argument, on the ground that by not admitting the
difference of nature it leads to a mixture and confusion of the Persons, we shall make to
such a charge this answer;—that while we confess the invariable character of the nature, we
do not deny the difference in respect of cause, and that which is caused, by which alone we
apprehend that one Person is distinguished from another;—by our belief, that is, that one
is the Cause, and another is of the Cause; and again in that which is of the Cause we recognize
another distinction. For one is directly from the first Cause, and another by that which is
directly from the first Cause; so that the attribute of being Only-begotten abides without
doubt in the Son, and the interposition of the Son, while it guards His attribute of being
Only-begotten, does not shut out the Spirit from His relation by way of nature to the Father.</p>
<p>But in speaking of “cause,” and “of the cause,” we do not by these words denote nature
(for no one would give the same definition of “cause” and of “nature”), but we indicate the
difference in manner of existence. For when we say that one is “caused,” and that the other
is “without cause,” we do not divide the nature by the word “cause1321”, but only indicate
the fact that the Son does not exist without generation, nor the Father by generation: but
we must needs in the first place believe that something exists, and then scrutinize the manner
of existence of the object of our belief: thus the question of existence is one, and that of the
mode of existence is another. To say that anything exists without generation sets forth the
mode of its existence, but what exists is not indicated by this phrase. If one were to ask a
husbandman about a tree, whether it were planted or had grown of itself, and he were to
answer either that the tree had not been planted or that it was the result of planting, would
he by that answer declare the nature of the tree? Surely not; but while saying how it exists
he would leave the question of its nature obscure and unexplained. So, in the other case,
when we learn that He is unbegotten, we are taught in what mode He exists, and how it is
fit that we should conceive Him as existing, but what He is we do not hear in that phrase.
When, therefore, we acknowledge such a distinction in the case of the Holy Trinity, as to
believe that one Person is the Cause, and another is of the Cause, we can no longer be accused
of confounding the definition of the Persons by the community of nature.</p>
<p>Thus, since on the one hand the idea of cause differentiates the Persons of the Holy
Trinity, declaring that one exists without a Cause, and another is of the Cause; and since on
the one hand the Divine nature is apprehended by every conception as unchangeable and
undivided, for these reasons we properly declare the Godhead to be one, and God to be one,
and employ in the singular all other names which express Divine attributes.</p>

<p>God commands us by His prophet not to esteem any new God to be God, and not to
worship any strange God1322. Now it is clear that that is called new which is not from
everlasting, and on the contrary, that is called everlasting which is not new. He, then, who
does not believe that the Only-begotten God is from everlasting of the Father does not deny
that He is new, for that which is not everlasting is confessedly new; and that which is new
is not God, according to the saying of Scripture, “there shall not be in thee any new God1323.”
Therefore he who says that the Son “once was not1324,” denies His Godhead. Again, He
Who says “thou shalt never worship a strange God1325” forbids us to worship another God;
and the strange God is so called in contradistinction to our own God. Who, then, is our
own God? Clearly, the true God. And who is the strange God? Surely, he who is alien from
the nature of the true God. If, therefore, our own God is the true God, and if, as the heretics
say, the Only-begotten God is not of the nature of the true God, He is a strange God, and
not our God. But the Gospel says, the sheep “will not follow a stranger1326.” He that says
He is created will make Him alien from the nature of the true God. What then will they do,
who say that He is created? Do they worship that same created being as God1327, or do they
not? For if they do not worship Him, they follow the Jews in denying the worship of Christ:
and if they do worship Him, they are idolaters, for they worship one alien from the true
God. But surely it is equally impious not to worship the Son, and to worship the strange
God. We must then say that the Son is the true Son of the true Father, that we may both
worship Him, and avoid condemnation as worshipping a strange God. But to those who
quote from the Proverbs the passage, “the Lord created me1328,” and think that they hereby
produce a strong argument that the Creator and Maker of all things was created, we must
answer that the Only-begotten God was made for us many things. For He was the Word,
and was made flesh; and He was God, and was made man; and He was without body, and

was made a body; and besides, He was made “sin,” and “a curse,” and “a stone,” and “an
axe,” and “bread,” and “a lamb,” and “a way,” and “a door,” and “a rock,” and many such
things; not being by nature any of these, but being made these things for our sakes, by way
of dispensation. As, therefore, being the Word, He was for our sakes made flesh, and as,
being God, He was made man, so also, being the Creator, He was made for our sakes a
creature; for the flesh is created. As, then, He said by the prophet, “Thus saith the Lord, He
that formed me from the womb to be His servant1329;” so He said also by Solomon, “The
Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works1330.” For all creation, as the
Apostle says, is in servitude1331. Therefore both He Who was formed in the Virgin’s womb,
according to the word of the prophet, is the servant, and not the Lord (that is to say, the
man according to the flesh, in whom God was manifested), and also, in the other passage,
He Who was created as the beginning of His ways is not God, but the man in whom God
was manifested to us for the renewing again of the ruined way of man’s salvation. So that,
since we recognize two things in Christ, one Divine, the other human (the Divine by nature,
but the human in the Incarnation), we accordingly claim for the Godhead that which is
eternal, and that which is created we ascribe to His human nature. For as, according to the
prophet, He was formed in the womb as a servant, so also, according to Solomon, He was
manifested in the flesh by means of this servile creation. But when they say, “if He was, He
was not begotten, and if He was begotten He was not,” let them learn that it is not fitting to
ascribe to His Divine nature the attributes which belong to His fleshly origin1332. For bodies
which do not exist, are generated, and God makes those things to be which are not, but does
not Himself come into being from that which is not. And for this reason also Paul calls Him
“the brightness of glory1333,” that we may learn that as the light from the lamp is of the
nature of that which sheds the brightness, and is united with it (for as soon as the lamp appears
the light that comes from it shines out simultaneously), so in this place the Apostle
would have us consider both that the Son is of the Father, and that the Father is never without
the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that
the lamp should be without brightness. But it is clear that as His being brightness is a testimony
to His being in relation with the glory (for if the glory did not exist, the brightness
shed from it would not exist), so, to say that the brightness “once was not1334” is a declaration

that the glory also was not, when the brightness was not; for it is impossible that the glory
should be without the brightness. As therefore it is not possible to say in the case of the
brightness, “If it was, it did not come into being, and if it came into being it was not,” so it
is in vain to say this of the Son, seeing that the Son is the brightness. Let those also who
speak of “less” and “greater,” in the case of the Father and the Son, learn from Paul not to
measure things immeasurable. For the Apostle says that the Son is the express image of the
Person of the Father1335. It is clear then that however great the Person of the Father is, so
great also is the express image of that Person; for it is not possible that the express image
should be less than the Person contemplated in it. And this the great John also teaches when
he says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God1336.” For in saying
that he was “in the beginning” and not “after the beginning,” he showed that the beginning
was never without the Word; and in declaring that “the Word was with God,” he signified
the absence of defect in the Son in relation to the Father; for the Word is contemplated as
a whole together with the whole being of God. For if the Word were deficient in His own
greatness so as not to be capable of relation with the whole being of God, we are compelled
to suppose that that part of God which extends beyond the Word is without the Word. But
in fact the whole magnitude of the Word is contemplated together with the whole magnitude
of God: and consequently in statements concerning the Divine nature, it is not admissible
to speak of “greater” and “less.”</p>
<p>As for those who say that the begotten is in its nature unlike the unbegotten, let them
learn from the example of Adam and Abel not to talk nonsense. For Adam himself was not
begotten according to the natural generation of men; but Abel was begotten of Adam. Now,
surely, he who was never begotten is called unbegotten, and he who came into being by
generation is called begotten1337; yet the fact that he was not begotten did not hinder Adam
from being a man, nor did the generation of Abel make him at all different from man’s
nature, but both the one and the other were men, although the one existed by being begotten,
and the other without generation. So in the case of our statements as to the Divine nature,
the fact of not being begotten, and that of being begotten, produce no diversity of nature,
but, just as in the case of Adam and Abel the manhood is one, so is the Godhead one in the
case of the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>Now touching the Holy Spirit also the blasphemers make the same statement as they
do concerning the Lord, saying that He too is created. But the Church believes, as concerning
the Son, so equally concerning the Holy Spirit, that He is uncreated, and that the whole

creation becomes good by participation in the good which is above it, while the Holy Spirit
needs not any to make Him good (seeing that He is good by virtue of His nature, as the
Scripture testifies)1338; that the creation is guided by the Spirit, while the Spirit gives guidance;
that the creation is governed, while the Spirit governs; that the creation is comforted, while
the Spirit comforts; that the creation is in bondage, while the Spirit gives freedom; that the
creation is made wise, while the Spirit gives the grace of wisdom; that the creation partakes
of the gifts, while the Spirit bestows them at His pleasure: “For all these worketh that one
and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will1339.” And one may find
multitudes of other proofs from the Scriptures that all the supreme and Divine attributes
which are applied by the Scriptures to the Father and the Son are also to be contemplated
in the Holy Spirit:—immortality, blessedness, goodness, wisdom, power, justice, holiness—
every excellent attribute is predicated of the Holy Spirit just as it is predicated of the Father
and of the Son, with the exception of those by which the Persons are clearly and distinctly
divided from each other; I mean, that the Holy Spirit is not called the Father, or the Son;
but all other names by which the Father and the Son are named are applied by Scripture to
the Holy Spirit also. By this, then, we apprehend that the Holy Spirit is above creation. Thus,
where the Father and the Son are understood to be, there the Holy Spirit also is understood
to be; for the Father and the Son are above creation, and this attribute the drift of our argument
claims for the Holy Spirit. So it follows, that one who places the Holy Spirit above the
creation has received the right and sound doctrine: for he will confess that uncreated nature
which we behold in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit to be one.</p>
<p>But since they bring forward as a proof, according to their ideas, of the created nature
of the Holy Spirit, that utterance of the prophet, which says, “He that stablisheth the thunder
and createth the spirit, and declareth unto man His Christ,1340” we must consider this, that
the prophet speaks of the creation of another Spirit, in the stablishing of the thunder, and
not of the Holy Spirit. For the name of “thunder” is given in mystical language to the Gospel.
Those, then, in whom arises firm and unshaken faith in the Gospel, pass from being flesh
to become spirit, as the Lord says, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit1341.” It is God, then, Who by stablishing the voice of the Gospel
makes the believer spirit: and he who is born of the Spirit and made spirit by such thunder,
“declares” Christ; as the Apostle says, “No man can say that Jesus Christ is Lord but by the
Holy Spirit1342.”</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>A few words are necessary to explain the scope and aim of this remarkable treatise. It
is not the work of one who held a brief for monasticism. Gregory deals with the celibate life
in a different way from other Catholic writers upon this theme. Athanasius and Basil both
saw in it the means of exhibiting to the world the Christian life definitely founded on the
orthodox faith; and, for each celibate himself, this visible imitation of Christ would be more
concentrated, when secular distractions and dissipations had been put aside for ever. Their
aims were entirely moral and ecclesiastical. But Gregory deals with the entire human development
in things spiritual. He has given the history of the struggle for moral and intellectual
perfection, and the conditions of its success. He had his own inner Christian experience,
the result of a recluse youth, on the one hand; he had the systems of heathen and Christian
philosophy on the other. The ideal life that he has sketched is as lofty in its aspiration as the
latter, and is couched in philosophic rather than in Scriptural language; but its scientific
ground-work is entirely peculiar to himself. That groundwork is briefly this; spirit must be
freed, so as to be drawn to the Divine Spirit; and to be so freed a “virginity” of the soul is
necessary. He comes in this way to blame marriage, because in most of the marriages that
he has known, this virginity of the soul is conspicuously absent. But he does not blame the
married state in itself; as he himself distinctly tells us. The virginity he seeks may exist even
there; and it is not by any means the same thing as celibacy. It is disengagedness of heart;
and is, as many passages in this treatise indicate, identical with philosophy, whose higher
manifestations had long ago been defined as Love, called forth by the sight of the immaterial
Beauty. Where this sight is not interrupted, or not treated with indifference, there Virginity
exists. With Gregory philosophy had become Life, and it is virginity that keeps it so,
and therein keeps it from being lost. Another word with which Gregory identified virginity
is “incorruptibility,” in language sometimes which recalls the lines—
<lg>
<l>“What, what is Virtue, but repose of mind?</l>
<l rend="indent">A pure ethereal calm that knows no storm,</l>
<l>Above the reach of wild ambition’s wind,</l>
<l rend="indent">Above the passions that this world deform,</l>
<l rend="indent">And torture man, a proud malignant worm.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Yet no one would imagine that here the poet, any more than S. Paul in Ephes. vi. 24
(see p. 343, note 3), meant celibacy per se. But it may be asked, how came Gregory to use
the word Virginity at all for pure disengagement of soul? The answer seems to be, that he
was very fond of metaphors and elaborate comparisons, ever since the days that he was a
student of Rhetoric; this treatise itself is full of similes from nature, and they are not so much

<pb n="632"/>
poetry or rhetoric, as necessary means of bringing his meaning vividly before readers. Virginity,
then, is one of these bold and telling figures; and in his hands it is a very suggestive
metaphor; though certainly at times it runs away with him. The accusation, then, that when
he identifies Piety and Virginity, he makes the former consist in a mere externality, is unfounded.
He uses the one word for the other without apprising us that it is a metaphor, and
he omits to give any dietary rules by which this virginity is secured. Therefore he appears
to mean celibacy. But on the other hand no arguments can be drawn from this treatise
against the monastic life; only Gregory is busied with other matters. Rather, if the actual
marriages of his time are such as he describes, it is a silent witness to the reasonableness, if
not to the necessity, of such a life within the church. For this view of virginity as solving the
question of Gregory’s supposed marriage, see Prolegomena, p. 3.</p>

<head>On Virginity.</head>
<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">   
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The object of this treatise is to create in its readers a passion for the life according to
excellence. There are many distractions1343, to use the word of the Divine Apostle, incident
to the secular life; and so this treatise would suggest, as a necessary door of entrance to the
holier life, the calling of Virginity; seeing that, while it is not easy in the entanglements of
this secular life to find quiet for that of Divine contemplation, those on the other hand who
have bid farewell to its troubles can with promptitude, and without distraction, pursue assiduously
their higher studies. Now, whereas all advice is in itself weak, and mere words of
exhortation will not make the task of recommending what is beneficial easier to any one,
unless he has first given a noble aspect to that which he urges on his hearer, this discourse
will accordingly begin with the praises of Virginity; the exhortation will come at the end;
moreover, as the beauty in anything gains lustre by the contrast with its opposite, it is requisite
that some mention should be made of the vexations of everyday life. Then it will be quite
in the plan of this work to introduce a sketch of the contemplative life, and to prove the
impossibility of any one attaining it who feel’s the world’s anxieties. In the devotee bodily
desire has become weak; and so there will follow an inquiry as to the true object of desire,
for which (and which only) we have received from our Maker our power of desiring. When
this has received all possible illustration, it will seem to follow naturally that we should
consider some method to attain it; and the true virginity, which is free from any stain of sin,
will be found to fit such a purpose. So all the intermediate part of the discourse, while it
seems to look elsewhere, will be really tending to the praises of this virginity. All the particular
rules obeyed by the followers of this high calling will, to avoid prolixity, be omitted
here; the exhortation in the discourse will be introduced only in general terms, and for cases
of wide application; but, in a way, particulars will be here included, and so nothing important
will be overlooked, while prolixity is avoided. Each of us, too, is inclined to embrace some
course of life with the greater enthusiasm, when he sees personalities who have already
gained distinction in it; we have therefore made the requisite mention of saints who have
gained their glory in celibacy. But further than this; the examples we have in biographies
cannot stimulate to the attainment of excellence, so much as a living voice and an example
which is still working for good; and so we have alluded to that most godly bishop1344, our
<note type="footnote">1343 περισπάσμων. The allusion must be to 1 Cor. vii. 35; but the actual word is not found in the whole of

father in God, who himself alone could be the master in such instructions. He will not indeed
be mentioned by name, but by certain indications we shall say in cipher that he is meant.
Thus, too, future readers will not think our advice unmeaning, when the candidate for this
life is told to school himself by recent masters. But let them first fix their attention only on
this: what such a master ought to be; then let them choose for their guidance those who
have at any time by God’s grace been raised up to be champions of this system of excellence;
for either they will find what they seek, or at all events will be no longer ignorant what it
ought to be.</p>

<p>The holy look of virginity is precious indeed in the judgment of all who make purity
the test of beauty; but it belongs to those alone whose struggles to gain this object of a noble
love are favoured and helped by the grace of God. Its praise is heard at once in the very
name which goes with it; “Uncorrupted1345” is the word commonly said of it, and this shows
the kind of purity that is in it; thus we can measure by its equivalent term the height of this
gift, seeing that amongst the many results of virtuous endeavour this alone has been honoured
with the title of the thing that is uncorrupted. And if we must extol with laudations this gift
from the great God, the words of His Apostle are sufficient in its praise; they are few, but
they throw into the background all extravagant laudations; he only styles as “holy and
without blemish1346” her who has this grace for her ornament. Now if the achievement of
this saintly virtue consists in making one “without blemish and holy,” and these epithets
are adopted in their first and fullest force to glorify the incorruptible Deity, what greater
praise of virginity can there be than thus to be shown in a manner deifying those who share
in her pure mysteries, so that they become partakers of His glory Who is in actual truth the
only Holy and Blameless One; their purity and their incorruptibility being the means of
bringing them into relationship with Him? Many who write lengthy laudations in detailed
treatises, with the view of adding something to the wonder of this grace, unconsciously defeat,
in my opinion, their own end; the fulsome manner in which they amplify their subject brings
its credit into suspicion. Nature’s greatnesses have their own way of striking with admiration;
they do not need the pleading of words: the sky, for instance, or the sun, or any other wonder
of the universe. In the business of this lower world words certainly act as a basement, and
the skill of praise does impart a look of magnificence; so much so, that mankind are apt to
suspect as the result of mere art the wonder produced by panegyric. So the one sufficient
way of praising virginity will be to show that that virtue is above praise, and to evince our
admiration of it by our lives rather than by our words. A man who takes this theme for
ambitious praise has the appearance of supposing that one drop of his own perspiration
will make an appreciable increase of the boundless ocean, if indeed he believes, as he does,
that any human words can give more dignity to so rare a grace; he must be ignorant either
of his own powers or of that which he attempts to praise.</p>
<note type="footnote">1345 τὸ ἄφθορον; this is connected just below with the Divine ἀφθαρσία. In commenting on the meaning of
this latter word at the close of the Epistle to the Ephesians, Bishop Ellicott prefers to take it with ἀγαπώντων,
“in a manner and an element that knows neither change, diminution, nor decay” (“in uncorruptness” R.V.): although
in the six other passages where it occurs in S. Paul “it refers directly or indirectly to a higher sphere than
the present.” i.e. of immortality above, and might so, if the construction allowed, be taken with χάρις. This illustrates
Gregory’s use of ἀφθαρσία in its human relation.</note>

<head>Chapter II.</head>
<p>Deep indeed will be the thought necessary to understand the surpassing excellence of
this grace. It is comprehended in the idea of the Father incorrupt; and here at the outset is
a paradox, viz. that virginity is found in Him, Who has a Son and yet without passion has
begotten Him. It is included too in the nature of this Only-begotten God, Who struck the
first note of all this moral innocence; it shines forth equally in His pure and passionless
generation. Again a paradox; that the Son should be known to us by virginity. It is seen, too,
in the inherent and incorruptible purity of the Holy Spirit; for when you have named the
pure and incorruptible you have named virginity. It accompanies the whole supramundane
existence; because of its passionlessness it is always present with the powers above; never
separated from aught that is Divine, it never touches the opposite of this. All whose instinct
and will have found their level in virtue are beautified with this perfect purity of the uncorrupted
state; all who are ranked in the opposite class of character are what they are, and are
called so, by reason of their fall from purity. What force of expression, then, will be adequate
to such a grace? How can there be no cause to fear lest the greatness of its intrinsic value
should be impaired by the efforts of any one’s eloquence? The estimate of it which he will
create will be less than that which his hearers had before. It will be well, then, to omit all
laudation in this case; we cannot lift words to the height of our theme. On the contrary, it
is possible to be ever mindful of this gift of God; and our lips may always speak of this
blessing; that, though it is the property of spiritual existence and of such singular excellence,
yet by the love of God it has been bestowed on those who have received their life from the
will of the flesh and from blood; that, when human nature has been based by passionate
inclinations, it stretches out its offer of purity like a hand to raise it up again and make it
look above. This, I think, was the reason why our Master, Jesus Christ Himself, the Fountain
of all innocence, did not come into the world by wedlock. It was, to divulge by the manner
of His Incarnation this great secret; that purity is the only complete indication1347 of the
presence of God and of His coming, and that no one can in reality secure this for himself,
unless he has altogether estranged himself from the passions of the flesh. What happened
in the stainless Mary when the fulness of the Godhead which was in Christ shone out through
her, that happens in every soul that leads by rule the virgin life. No longer indeed does the
Master come with bodily presence; “we know Christ no longer according to the flesh1348”;

but, spiritually, He dwells in us and brings His Father with Him, as the Gospel somewhere1349
tells. Seeing, then, that virginity means so much as this, that while it remains in Heaven with
the Father of spirits, and moves in the dance of the celestial powers, it nevertheless stretches
out hands for man’s salvation; that while it is the channel which draws down the Deity to
share man’s estate, it keeps wings for man’s desires to rise to heavenly things, and is a bond
of union between the Divine and human, by its mediation bringing into harmony these
existences so widely divided—what words could be discovered powerful enough to reach
this wondrous height? But still, it is monstrous to seem like creatures without expression
and without feeling; and we must choose (if we are silent) one of two things; either to appear
never to have felt the special beauty of virginity, or to exhibit ourselves as obstinately blind
to all beauty: we have consented therefore to speak briefly about this virtue, according to
the wish of him who has assigned us this task, and whom in all things we must obey. But
let no one expect from us any display of style; even if we wished it, perhaps we could not
produce it, for we are quite unversed in that kind of writing. Even if we possessed such
power, we would not prefer the favour of the few to the edification of the many. A writer
of sense should have, I take it, for his chiefest object not to be admired above all other writers,
but to profit both himself and them, the many.</p>

<p>Would indeed that some profit might come to myself from this effort! I should have
undertaken this labour with the greater readiness, if I could have hope of sharing, according
to the Scripture, in the fruits of the plough and the threshing-floor; the toil would then have
been a pleasure. As it is, this my knowledge of the beauty of virginity is in some sort vain
and useless to me, just as the corn is to the muzzled ox that treads1350 the floor, or the water
that streams from the precipice to a thirsty man when he cannot reach it. Happy they who
have still the power of choosing the better way, and have not debarred themselves from it
by engagements of the secular life, as we have, whom a gulf now divides from glorious virginity:
no one can climb up to that who has once planted his foot upon the secular life. We
are but spectators of others’ blessings and witnesses to the happiness of another1351 class.
Even if we strike out some fitting thoughts about virginity, we shall not be better than the
cooks and scullions who provide sweet luxuries for the tables of the rich, without having
any portion themselves in what they prepare. What a blessing if it had been otherwise, if we
had not to learn the good by after-regrets! Now they are the enviable ones, they succeed
even beyond their prayers and their desires, who have not put out of their power the enjoyment
of these delights. We are like those who have a wealthy society with which to compare
their own poverty, and so are all the more vexed and discontented with their present lot.
The more exactly we understand the riches of virginity, the more we must bewail the other
life; for we realize by this contrast with better things, how poor it is. I do not speak only of
the future rewards in store for those who have lived thus excellently, but those rewards also
which they have while alive here; for if any one would make up his mind to measure exactly
the difference between the two courses, he would find it well-nigh as great as that between
heaven and earth. The truth of this statement may be known by looking at actual facts.</p>
<p>But in writing this sad tragedy what will be a fit beginning? How shall we really bring
to view the evils common to life? All men know them by experience, but somehow nature
has contrived to blind the actual sufferers so that they willingly ignore their condition. Shall
we begin with its choicest sweets? Well then, is not the sum total of all that is hoped for in
marriage to get delightful companionship? Grant this obtained; let us sketch a marriage in
every way most happy; illustrious birth, competent means, suitable ages, the very flower of
the prime of life, deep affection, the very best that each can think of the other1352, that sweet
rivalry of each wishing to surpass the other in loving; in addition, popularity, power, wide

<pb n="639"/>
reputation, and everything else. But observe that even beneath this array of blessings the
fire of an inevitable pain is smouldering. I do not speak of the envy that is always springing
up against those of distinguished rank, and the liability to attack which hangs over those
who seem prosperous, and that natural hatred of superiors shown by those who do not share
equally in the good fortune, which make these seemingly favoured ones pass an anxious
time more full of pain than pleasure. I omit that from the picture, and will suppose that
envy against them is asleep; although it would not be easy to find a single life in which both
these blessings were joined, i.e. happiness above the common, and escape from envy.
However, let us, if so it is to be, suppose a married life free from all such trials; and let us
see if it is possible for those who live with such an amount of good fortune to enjoy it. Why,
what kind of vexation is left, you will ask, when even envy of their happiness does not reach
them? I affirm that this very thing, this sweetness that surrounds their lives, is the spark
which kindles pain. They are human all the time, things weak and perishing; they have to
look upon the tombs of their progenitors; and so pain is inseparably bound up with their
existence, if they have the least power of reflection. This continued expectancy of death,
realized by no sure tokens, but hanging over them the terrible uncertainty of the future,
disturbs their present joy, clouding it over with the fear of what is coming. If only, before
experience comes, the results of experience could be learnt, or if, when one has entered on
this course, it were possible by some other means of conjecture to survey the reality, then
what a crowd of deserters would run from marriage into the virgin life; what care and
eagerness never to be entangled in that retentive snare, where no one knows for certain how
the net galls till they have actually entered it! You would see there, if only you could do it
without danger, many contraries uniting; smiles melting into tears, pain mingled with
pleasure, death always hanging by expectation over the children that are born, and putting
a finger upon each of the sweetest joys. Whenever the husband looks at the beloved face,
that moment the fear of separation accompanies the look. If he listens to the sweet voice,
the thought comes into his mind that some day he will not hear it. Whenever he is glad with
gazing on her beauty, then he shudders most with the presentiment of mourning her loss.
When he marks all those charms which to youth are so precious and which the thoughtless
seek for, the bright eyes beneath the lids, the arching eyebrows, the cheek with its sweet and
dimpling smile, the natural red that blooms upon the lips, the gold-bound hair shining in
many-twisted masses on the head, and all that transient grace, then, though he may be little
given to reflection, he must have this thought also in his inmost soul that some day all this
beauty will melt away and become as nothing, turned after all this show into noisome and
unsightly bones, which wear no trace, no memorial, no remnant of that living bloom. Can
he live delighted when he thinks of that? Can he trust in these treasures which he holds as
if they would be always his? Nay, it is plain that he will stagger as if he were mocked by a
dream, and will have his faith in life shaken, and will look upon what he sees as no longer

<pb n="640"/>
his. You will understand, if you have a comprehensive view of things as they are, that
nothing in this life looks that which it is. It shows to us by the illusions of our imagination
one thing, instead of something else. Men gaze open-mouthed at it, and it mocks them with
hopes; for a while it hides itself beneath this deceitful show; then all of a sudden in the reverses
of life it is revealed as something different from that which men’s hopes, conceived by its
fraud in foolish hearts, had pictured. Will life’s sweetness seem worth taking delight in to
him who reflects on this? Will he ever be able really to feel it, so as to have joy in the goods
he holds? Will he not, disturbed by the constant fear of some reverse, have the use without
the enjoyment? I will but mention the portents, dreams, omens, and such-like things which
by a foolish habit of thought are taken notice of, and always make men fear the worst. But
her time of labour comes upon the young wife; and the occasion is regarded not as the
bringing of a child into the world, but as the approach of death; in bearing it is expected
that she will die; and, indeed, often this sad presentiment is true, and before they spread the
birthday feast, before they taste any of their expected joys, they have to change their rejoicing
into lamentation. Still in love’s fever, still at the height of their passionate affection, not yet
having grasped life’s sweetest gifts, as in the vision of a dream, they are suddenly torn away
from all they possessed. But what comes next? Domestics, like conquering foes, dismantle
the bridal chamber; they deck it for the funeral, but it is death’s1353 room now; they make
the useless wailings1354 and beatings of the hands. Then there is the memory of former days,
curses on those who advised the marriage, recriminations against friends who did not stop
it; blame thrown on parents whether they be alive or dead, bitter outbursts against human
destiny, arraigning of the whole course of nature, complaints and accusations even against
the Divine government; war within the man himself, and fighting with those who would
admonish; no repugnance to the most shocking words and acts. In some this state of mind
continues, and their reason is more completely swallowed up by grief; and their tragedy has
a sadder ending, the victim not enduring to survive the calamity.</p>
<p>But rather than this let us suppose a happier case. The danger of childbirth is past; a
child is born to them, the very image of its parents’ beauty. Are the occasions for grief at all
lessened thereby? Rather they are increased; for the parents retain all their former fears, and
feel in addition those on behalf of the child, lest anything should happen to it in its bringing
up; for instance a bad accident, or by some turn of misfortunes a sickness, a fever1355, any
dangerous disease. Both parents share alike in these; but who could recount the special
anxieties of the wife? We omit the most obvious, which all can understand, the weariness

of pregnancy, the danger in childbirth, the cares of nursing, the tearing of her heart in two
for her offspring, and, if she is the mother of many, the dividing of her soul into as many
parts as she has children; the tenderness with which she herself feels all that is happening
to them. That is well understood by every one. But the oracle of God tells us that she is not
her own mistress, but finds her resources only in him whom wedlock has made her lord;
and so, if she be for ever so short a time left alone, she feels as if she were separated from
her head, and can ill bear it; she even takes this short absence of her husband to be the prelude
to her widowhood; her fear makes her at once give up all hope; accordingly her eyes, filled
with terrified suspense, are always fixed upon the door; her ears are always busied with what
others are whispering; her heart, stung with her fears, is well-nigh bursting even before any
bad1356 news has arrived; a noise in the doorway, whether fancied or real, acts as a messenger
of ill, and on a sudden shakes her very soul; most likely all outside is well, and there is no
cause to fear at all; but her fainting spirit is quicker than any message, and turns her fancy
from good tidings to despair. Thus even the most favoured live, and they are not altogether
to be envied; their life is not to be compared to the freedom of virginity. Yet this hasty sketch
has omitted many of the more distressing details. Often this young wife too, just wedded,
still brilliant in bridal grace, still perhaps blushing when her bridegroom enters, and shyly
stealing furtive glances at him, when passion is all the more intense because modesty prevents
it being shown, suddenly has to take the name of a poor lonely widow and be called all that
is pitiable. Death comes in an instant and changes that bright creature in her white and rich
attire into a black-robed mourner. He takes off the bridal ornaments and clothes her with
the colours of bereavement. There is darkness in the once cheerful room, and the waitingwomen
sing their long dirges. She hates her friends when they try to soften her grief; she
will not take food, she wastes away, and in her soul’s deep dejection has a strong longing
only for her death, a longing which often lasts till it comes. Even supposing that time puts
an end to this sorrow, still another comes, whether she has children or not. If she has, they
are fatherless, and, as objects of pity themselves, renew the memory of her loss. If she is
childless, then the name of her lost husband is rooted up, and this grief is greater than the
seeming consolation. I will say little of the other special sorrows of widowhood; for who
could enumerate them all exactly? She finds her enemies in her relatives. Some actually take
advantage of her affliction. Others exult over her loss, and see with malignant joy the home
falling to pieces, the insolence of the servants, and the other distresses visible in such a case,
of which there are plenty. In consequence of these, many women are compelled to risk once
more the trial of the same things, not being able to endure this bitter derision. As if they
could revenge insults by increasing their own sufferings! Others, remembering the past, will
put up with anything rather than plunge a second time into the like troubles. If you wish to

learn all the trials of this married life, listen to those women who actually know it. How they
congratulate those who have chosen from the first the virgin life, and have not had to learn
by experience about the better way, that virginity is fortified against all these ills, that it has
no orphan state, no widowhood to mourn; it is always in the presence of the undying
Bridegroom; it has the offspring of devotion always to rejoice in; it sees continually a home
that is truly its own, furnished with every treasure because the Master always dwells there;
in this case death does not bring separation, but union with Him Who is longed for; for
when (a soul) departs1357, then it is with Christ, as the Apostle says. But it is time, now that
we have examined on the one side the feelings of those whose lot is happy, to make a revelation
of other lives, where poverty and adversity and all the other evils which men have to
suffer are a fixed condition; deformities, I mean, and diseases, and all other lifelong afflictions.
He whose life is contained in himself either escapes them altogether or can bear them easily,
possessing a collected mind which is not distracted from itself; while he who shares himself
with wife and child often has not a moment to bestow even upon regrets for his own condition,
because anxiety for his dear ones fills his heart. But it is superfluous to dwell upon that
which every one knows. If to what seems prosperity such pain and weariness is bound, what
may we not expect of the opposite condition? Every description which attempts to represent
it to our view will fall short of the reality. Yet perhaps we may in a very few words declare
the depths of its misery. Those whose lot is contrary to that which passes as prosperous receive
their sorrows as well from causes contrary to that. Prosperous lives are marred by the
expectancy, or the presence, of death; but the misery of these is that death delays his coming.
These lives then are widely divided by opposite feelings; although equally without hope,
they converge to the same end. So many-sided, then, so strangely different are the ills with
which marriage supplies the world. There is pain always, whether children are born, or can
never be expected, whether they live, or die. One abounds in them but has not enough means
for their support; another feels the want of an heir to the great fortune he has toiled for, and
regards as a blessing the other’s misfortune; each of them, in fact, wishes for that very thing
which he sees the other regretting. Again, one man loses by death a much-loved1358 son;
another has a reprobate son alive; both equally to be pitied, though the one mourns over
the death, the other over the life, of his boy. Neither will I do more than mention how sadly
and disastrously family jealousies and quarrels, arising from real or fancied causes, end.

Who could go completely into all those details? If you would know what a network of these
evils human life is, you need not go back again to those old stories which have furnished
subjects to dramatic poets. They are regarded as myths on account of their shocking extravagance;
there are in them murders and eating of children, husband-murders, murders of
mothers and brothers, incestuous unions, and every sort of disturbance of nature; and yet
the old chronicler begins the story which ends in such horrors with marriage. But turning
from all that, gaze only upon the tragedies that are being enacted on this life’s stage; it is
marriage that supplies mankind with actors there. Go to the law-courts and read through
the laws there; then you will know the shameful secrets of marriage. Just as when you hear
a physician explaining various diseases, you understand the misery of the human frame by
learning the number and the kind of sufferings it is liable to, so when you peruse the laws
and read there the strange variety of crimes in marriage to which their penalties are attached,
you will have a pretty accurate idea of its properties; for the law does not provide remedies
for evils which do not exist, any more than a physician has a treatment for diseases which
are never known.</p>

<p>But we need no longer show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the
number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take
the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in
all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself
in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing
through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world,
and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether
from human life by his abstinence from marriage,—that man has no fellowship
whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of
the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is
nothing in him to provoke his neighbours’ envy, because he clutches none of those objects
round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing
virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For
virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will
be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on
this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they
take from the other, so that the one person’s gain is his fellow’s loss; whence arise the fights
for the lion’s share, from men’s hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession
is never envied; he who snatches the lion’s share does no damage to him who claims
equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth
of virtues in those who are already occupiers1359 is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with
his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only
treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes
tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly
seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our
words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he
will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all,
marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the deadly sin of pride,
and one would not be far wrong in saying that this is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin;
but it is from reasons connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what
I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man
mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: “he
must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation
to come by leaving his children historic records of himself”: so also the other maladies

of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be
found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it
gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves
of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished
person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power,
and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the
longest number, according to the Psalmist’s computation, and then compares this atominterval
with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for
such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there
enviable in that which so many strive for,—honour? What is gained by those who win it?
The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor
of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never
belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof1360,” for “God is king of all the earth1361.” It is the passion of having which gives
men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. “The earth,” says the
wise Preacher, “abideth for ever1362,” ministering to every generation, first one, then another,
that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are
brought into life without knowing it by their Maker’s will, and before they wish are withdrawn
from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now
born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds
cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because “all flesh is grass,
and all the glory of man as the flower of grass1363,” can never care for this grass which “today
is and to-morrow is not”; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life
has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects
his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, “Heaven and earth
shall pass away1364,” the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is “in this
tabernacle1365,” exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the
lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they
live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning
at the continuance of this sojourn, says, “Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged1366,” and

he attributes the cause of his dejection to “darkness”; for we know that darkness is called in
the Hebrew language “kedar.” It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind,
and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living,
and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and
is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth,
or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or
subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life,
seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to
the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because
life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of
either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, “through armour on
the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report1367.” Therefore the
clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing
its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures
nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always,
and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their
journey’s end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms,
or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a
gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed
end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed
on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the
grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep
stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures1368; it is alienated from
the life of God1369, and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good
but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that “walks in darkness1370,” and
invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust
of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men’s homes. In these
vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to
follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the
first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the
first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so
firmly are men’s vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained

the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed
chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his
thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame;
he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping
after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards
his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured
temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation
which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one
cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered
once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations
of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this
sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who
has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt
rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that
is, this life that lies under water1371, and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy
Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master’s words, “the
truth shall not have made us free,” how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of
this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be
chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning
clearer. A winter torrent1372, which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down
beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger
to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages
in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has
to receive those sufferings which nature’s stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must,
to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent,
and these “proud waters1373,” he will escape from being “a prey to the teeth” of this life, as
the Psalm goes on to say, and, as “a bird from the snare,” on virtue’s wings. This simile,
then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down
to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied;
all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so
that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current
snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a
stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep
for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life’s most cherished

objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What
wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into
their opposites. Who can continue in life’s prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not
Nature made the bloom of beauty even more short-lived than the shows of spring? For they
blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding
they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits
the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts
of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the
veil of oblivion. Nature’s inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate.
One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get
as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for
a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live
for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for
the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate
the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of
all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.</p>

<p>Now we declare that Virginity is man’s “fellow-worker” and helper in achieving the aim
of this lofty passion. In other sciences men have devised certain practical methods for cultivating
the particular subject; and so, I take it, virginity is the practical method in the science
of the Divine life, furnishing men with the power of assimilating themselves with spiritual
natures. The constant endeavour in such a course is to prevent the nobility of the soul from
being lowered by those sensual outbreaks, in which the mind no longer maintains its heavenly
thoughts and upward gaze, but sinks down to the emotions belonging to the flesh and blood.
How can the soul which is riveted1374 to the pleasures of the flesh and busied with merely
human longings turn a disengaged eye upon its kindred intellectual light? This evil, ignorant,
and prejudiced bias towards material things will prevent it. The eyes of swine, turning naturally
downward, have no glimpse of the wonders of the sky; no more can the soul whose
body drags it down look any longer upon the beauty above; it must pore perforce upon
things which though natural are low and animal. To look with a free devoted gaze upon
heavenly delights, the soul will turn itself from earth; it will not even partake of the recognized
indulgences of the secular life; it will transfer all its powers of affection from material objects
to the intellectual contemplation of immaterial beauty. Virginity of the body is devised to
further such a disposition of the soul; it aims at creating in it a complete forgetfulness of
natural emotions; it would prevent the necessity of ever descending to the call of fleshly
needs. Once freed from such, the soul runs no risk of becoming, through a growing habit
of indulging in that which seems to a certain extent conceded by nature’s law, inattentive
and ignorant of Divine and undefiled delights. Purity of the heart, that master of our lives,
alone can capture them.</p>

<p>This, I believe, makes the greatness of the prophet Elias, and of him who afterwards
appeared in the spirit and power of Elias, than whom “of those that are born of women there
was none greater1375.” If their history conveys any other mystic lesson, surely this above all
is taught by their special mode of life, that the man whose thoughts are fixed upon the invisible
is necessarily separated from all the ordinary events of life; his judgments as to the True
Good cannot be confused and led astray by the deceits arising from the senses. Both, from
their youth upwards, exiled themselves from human society, and in a way from human
nature, in their neglect of the usual kinds of meat and drink, and their sojourn in the desert.
The wants of each were satisfied by the nourishment that came in their way, so that their
taste might remain simple and unspoilt, as their ears were free from any distracting noise,
and their eyes from any wandering look. Thus they attained a cloudless calm of soul, and
were raised to that height of Divine favour which Scripture records of each. Elias, for instance,
became the dispenser of God’s earthly gifts; he had authority to close at will the uses of the
sky against the sinners and to open them to the penitent. John is not said indeed to have
done any miracle; but the gift in him was pronounced by Him Who sees the secrets of a
man greater than any prophet’s. This was so, we may presume, because both, from beginning
to end, so dedicated their hearts to the Lord that they were unsullied by any earthly passion;
because the love of wife or child, or any other human call, did not intrude upon them, and
they did not even think their daily sustenance worthy of anxious thought; because they
showed themselves to be above any magnificence1376 of dress, and made shift with that
which chance offered them, one clothing himself in goat-skins, the other with camel’s hair.
It is my belief that they would not have reached to this loftiness of spirit, if marriage had
softened them. This is not simple history only; it is “written for our admonition1377,” that
we might direct our lives by theirs. What, then, do we learn thereby? This: that the man who
longs for union with God must, like those saints, detach his mind from all worldly business.
It is impossible for the mind which is poured into many channels to win its way to the
knowledge and the love of God.</p>

<p>An illustration will make our teaching on this subject clearer. Imagine a stream flowing
from a spring and dividing itself off into a number of accidental channels. As long as it
proceeds so, it will be useless for any purpose of agriculture, the dissipation of its waters
making each particular current small and feeble, and therefore slow. But if one were to mass
these wandering and widely dispersed rivulets again into one single channel, he would have
a full and collected stream for the supplies which life demands. Just so the human mind (so
it seems to me), as long as its current spreads itself in all directions over the pleasures of the
sense, has no power that is worth the naming of making its way towards the Real Good; but
once call it back and collect it upon itself, so that it may begin to move without scattering
and wandering towards the activity which is congenital and natural to it, it will find no
obstacle in mounting to higher things, and in grasping realities. We often see water contained
in a pipe bursting upwards through this constraining force, which will not let it leak; and
this, in spite of its natural gravitation: in the same way, the mind of man, enclosed in the
compact channel of an habitual continence, and not having any side issues, will be raised
by virtue of its natural powers of motion to an exalted love. In fact, its Maker ordained that
it should always move, and to stop is impossible to it; when therefore it is prevented employing
this power upon trifles, it cannot be but that it will speed toward the truth, all improper
exits being closed. In the case of many turnings we see travellers can keep to the direct route,
when they have learnt that the other roads are wrong, and so avoid them; the more they
keep out of these wrong directions, the more they will preserve the straight course; in like
manner the mind in turning from vanities will recognize the truth. The great prophets, then,
whom we have mentioned seem to teach this lesson, viz. to entangle ourselves with none of
the objects of this world’s effort; marriage is one of these, or rather it is the primal root of
all striving after vanities.</p>

<p>Let no one think however that herein we depreciate marriage as an institution. We are
well aware that it is not a stranger to God’s blessing. But since the common instincts of
mankind can plead sufficiently on its behalf, instincts which prompt by a spontaneous bias
to take the high road of marriage for the procreation of children, whereas Virginity in a way
thwarts this natural impulse, it is a superfluous task to compose formally an Exhortation to
marriage. We put forward the pleasure of it instead, as a most doughty champion on its
behalf. It may be however, notwithstanding this, that there is some need of such a treatise,
occasioned by those who travesty the teaching of the Church. Such persons1378 “have their
conscience seared with a hot iron,” as the Apostle expresses it; and very truly too, considering
that, deserting the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the “doctrines of devils,” they have some
ulcers and blisters stamped upon their hearts, abominating God’s creatures, and calling
them “foul,” “seducing,” “mischievous,” and so on. “But what have I to do to judge them
that are without1379?” asks the Apostle. Truly those persons are outside the Court in which
the words of our mysteries are spoken; they are not installed under God’s roof, but in the
monastery of the Evil One. They “are taken captive by him at his will1380.” They therefore
do not understand that all virtue is found in moderation, and that any declension to either
side1381 of it becomes a vice. He, in fact, who grasps the middle point between doing too
little and doing too much has hit the distinction between vice and virtue. Instances will
make this clearer. Cowardice and audacity are two recognized vices opposed to each other;
the one the defect, the other the excess of confidence; between them lies courage. Again,
piety is neither atheism nor superstition; it is equally impious to deny a God and to believe
in many gods. Is there need of more examples to bring this principle home? The man who
avoids both meanness and prodigality will by this shunning of extremes form the moral
habit of liberality; for liberality is the thing which is neither inclined to spend at random
vast and useless sums, nor yet to be closely calculating in necessary expenses. We need not
go into details in the case of all good qualities. Reason, in all of them, has established virtue
to be a middle state between two extremes. Sobriety itself therefore is a middle state, and
manifestly involves the two declensions on either side towards vice; he, that is, who is
wanting in firmness of soul, and is so easily worsted in the combat with pleasure as never
even to have approached the path of a virtuous and sober life, slides into shameful indulgence;
while he who goes beyond the safe ground of sobriety and overshoots the moderation of

this virtue, falls as it were from a precipice into the “doctrines of devils,” “having his conscience
seared with a hot iron.” In declaring marriage abominable he brands himself with
such reproaches; for “if the tree is corrupt” (as the Gospel says), “the fruit also of the tree
will be like it1382”; if a man is the shoot and fruitage of the tree of marriage, reproaches cast
on that turn upon him who casts them1383. These persons, then, are like branded criminals
already; their conscience is covered with the stripes of this unnatural teaching. But our view
of marriage is this; that, while the pursuit of heavenly things should be a man’s first care,
yet if he can use the advantages of marriage with sobriety and moderation, he need not
despise this way of serving the state. An example might be found in the patriarch Isaac. He
married Rebecca when he was past the flower of his age and his prime was well-nigh spent,
so that his marriage was not the deed of passion, but because of God’s blessing that should
be upon his seed. He cohabited with her till the birth of her only children1384, and then,
closing the channels of the senses, lived wholly for the Unseen; for this is what seems to be
meant by the mention in his history of the dimness of the Patriarch’s eyes. But let that be as
those think who are skilled in reading these meanings, and let us proceed with the continuity
of our discourse. What then, were we saying? That in the cases where it is possible at once
to be true to the diviner love, and to embrace wedlock, there is no reason for setting aside
this dispensation of nature and misrepresenting as abominable that which is honourable.
Let us take again our illustration of the water and the spring. Whenever the husbandman,
in order to irrigate a particular spot, is bringing the stream thither, but there is need before
it gets there of a small outlet, he will allow only so much to escape into that outlet as is adequate
to supply the demand, and can then easily be blended again with the main stream.
If, as an inexperienced and easy-going steward, he opens too wide a channel, there will be
danger of the whole stream quitting its direct bed and pouring itself sideways. In the same
way, if (as life does need a mutual succession) a man so treats this need as to give spiritual
things the first thought, and because of the shortness1385 of the time indulges but sparingly
the sexual passion and keeps it under restraint, that man would realize the character of the
prudent husband man to which the Apostle exhorts us. About the details of paying these
trifling debts of nature he will not be over-calculating, but the long hours of his prayers1386

will secure the purity which is the key-note of his life. He will always fear lest by this kind
of indulgence he may become nothing but flesh and blood; for in them God’s Spirit does
not dwell. He who is of so weak a character that he cannot make a manful stand against
nature’s impulse had better1387 keep himself very far away from such temptations, rather
than descend into a combat which is above his strength. There is no small danger for him
lest, cajoled in the valuation of pleasure, he should think that there exists no other good but
that which is enjoyed along with some sensual emotion, and, turning altogether from the
love of immaterial delights, should become entirely of the flesh, seeking always his pleasure
only there, so that his character will be a Pleasure-lover, not a God-lover. It is not every
man’s gift, owing to weakness of nature, to hit the due proportion in these matters; there is
a danger of being carried far beyond it, and “sticking fast in the deep mire1388,” to use the
Psalmist’s words. It would therefore be for our interest, as our discourse has been suggesting,
to pass through life without a trial of these temptations, lest under cover of the excuse of
lawful indulgence passion should gain an entrance into the citadel of the soul.</p>

<p>Custom is indeed in everything hard to resist. It possesses an enormous power of attracting
and seducing the soul. In the cases where a man has got into a fixed state of sentiment,
a certain imagination of the good is created in him by this habit; and nothing is so naturally
vile but it may come to be thought both desirable and laudable, once it has got into the
fashion1389. Take mankind now living on the earth. There are many nations, and their ambitions
are not all the same. The standard of beauty and of honour is different in each, the
custom of each regulating their enthusiasm and their aims. This unlikeness is seen not only
amongst nations where the pursuits of the one are in no repute with the other, but even in
the same nation, and the same city, and the same family; we may see in those aggregates
also much difference existing owing to customary feeling. Thus brothers born from the
same throe are separated widely from each other in the aims of life. Nor is this to be wondered
at, considering that each single man does not generally keep to the same opinion about the
same thing, but alters it as fashion influences him. Not to go far from our present subject,
we have known those who have shown themselves to be in love with chastity all through
the early years of puberty; but in taking the pleasures which men think legitimate and allowable
they make them the starting-point of an impure life, and when once they have admitted
these temptations, all the forces of their feeling are turned in that direction, and, to take
again our illustration of the stream, they let it rush from the diviner channel into low material
channels, and make within themselves a broad path for passion; so that the stream of
their love leaves dry the abandoned channel of the higher way1390 and flows abroad in indulgence.
It would be well then, we take it, for the weaker brethren to fly to virginity as into
an impregnable fortress, rather than to descend into the career of life’s consequences and
invite temptations to do their worst upon them, entangling themselves in those things which
through the lusts of the flesh war against the law of our mind; it would be well for them to
consider1391 that herein they risk not broad acres, or wealth, or any other of this life’s prizes,
but the hope which has been their guide. It is impossible that one who has turned to the
world and feels its anxieties, and engages his heart in the wish to please men, can fulfil that
first and great commandment of the Master, “Thou shalt love God with all thy heart and
with all thy strength1392.” How can he fulfil that, when he divides his heart between God
and the world, and exhausts the love which he owes to Him alone in human affections? “He
that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord; but he that is married careth for the

things that are of the world1393.” If the combat with pleasure seems wearisome, nevertheless
let all take heart. Habit will not fail to produce, even in the seemingly most fretful1394, a
feeling of pleasure through the very effort of their perseverance; and that pleasure will be
of the noblest and purest kind; which the intelligent may well be enamoured of, rather than
allow themselves, with aims narrowed by the lowness of their objects, to be estranged from
the true greatness which goes beyond all thought.</p>

<p>What words indeed could possibly express the greatness of that loss in falling away from
the possession of real goodness? What consummate power of thought would have to be
employed! Who could produce even in outline that which speech cannot tell, nor the mind
grasp? On the one hand, if a man has kept the eye of his heart so clear that he can in a way
behold the promise of our Lord’s Beatitudes realized, he will condemn all human utterance
as powerless to represent that which he has apprehended. On the other hand, if a man from
the atmosphere of material indulgences has the weakness of passion spreading like a film
over the keen vision of his soul, all force of expression will be wasted upon him; for it is all
one whether you understate or whether you magnify a miracle to those who have no power
whatever of perceiving it1395. Just as, in the case of the sunlight, on one who has never from
the day of his birth seen it, all efforts at translating it into words are quite thrown away; you
cannot make the splendour of the ray shine1396 through his ears; in like manner, to see the
beauty of the true and intellectual light, each man has need of eyes of his own; and he who
by a gift of Divine inspiration can see it retains his ecstasy unexpressed in the depths of his
consciousness; while he who sees it not cannot be made to know even the greatness of his
loss. How should he? This good escapes his perception, and it cannot be represented to him;
it is unspeakable, and cannot be delineated. We have not learnt the peculiar language expressive
of this beauty. An example of what we want to say does not exist in the world; a
comparison for it would at least be very difficult to find. Who compares the Sun to a little
spark? or the vast Deep to a drop? And that tiny drop and that diminutive spark bear the
same relation to the Deep and to the Sun, as any beautiful object of man’s admiration does
to that real beauty on the features of the First Good, of which we catch the glimpse beyond
any other good. What words could be invented to show the greatness of this loss to him
who suffers it? Well does the great David seem to me to express the impossibility of doing
this. He has been lifted by the power of the Spirit out of himself, and sees in a blessed state
of ecstacy the boundless and incomprehensible Beauty; he sees it as fully as a mortal can see
who has quitted his fleshly envelopments and entered, by the mere power of thought, upon
the contemplation of the spiritual and intellectual world, and in his longing to speak a word
worthy of the spectacle he bursts forth with that cry, which all re-echo, “Every man a liar1397!”
I take that to mean that any man who entrusts to language the task of presenting the ineffable
Light is really and truly a liar; not because of any hatred on his part of the truth, but because
of the feebleness of his instrument for expressing the thing thought of1398. The visible beauty

to be met with in this life of ours, showing glimpses of itself, whether in inanimate objects
or in animate organisms in a certain choiceness of colour, can be adequately admired by
our power of aesthetic feeling. It can be illustrated and made known to others by description;
it can be seen drawn in the language as in a picture. Even a perfect type1399 of such beauty
does not baffle our conception. But how can language illustrate when it finds no media for
its sketch, no colour, no contour1400, no majestic size, no faultlessness of feature; nor any
other commonplace of art? The Beauty which is invisible and formless, which is destitute
of qualities and far removed from everything which we recognize in bodies by the eye, can
never be made known by the traits which require nothing but the perceptions of our senses
in order to be grasped. Not that we are to despair of winning this object of our love, though
it does seem too high for our comprehension. The more reason shows the greatness of this
thing which we are seeking, the higher we must lift our thoughts and excite them with the
greatness of that object; and we must fear to lose our share in that transcendent Good. There
is indeed no small amount of danger lest, as we can base the apprehension of it on no
knowable qualities, we should slip away from it altogether because of its very height and
mystery. We deem it necessary therefore, owing to this weakness of the thinking faculty, to
lead it towards the Unseen by stages through the cognizances of the senses. Our conception
of the case is as follows.</p>

<p>Now those who take a superficial and unreflecting view of things observe the outward
appearance of anything they meet, e.g. of a man, and then trouble themselves no more about
him. The view they have taken of the bulk of his body is enough to make them think that
they know all about him. But the penetrating and scientific mind will not trust to the eyes
alone the task of taking the measure of reality; it will not stop at appearances, nor count that
which is not seen amongst unrealities. It inquires into the qualities of the man’s soul. It takes
those of its characteristics which have been developed by his bodily constitution, both in
combination and singly; first singly, by analysis, and then in that living combination which
makes the personality of the subject. As regards the inquiry into the nature of beauty, we
see, again, that the man of half-grown intelligence, when he observes an object which is
bathed in the glow of a seeming beauty, thinks that that object is in its essence beautiful, no
matter what it is that so prepossesses him with the pleasure of the eye. He will not go deeper
into the subject. But the other, whose mind’s eye is clear, and who can inspect such appearances,
will neglect those elements which are the material only upon which the Form of
Beauty works; to him they will be but the ladder by which he climbs to the prospect of that
Intellectual Beauty, in accordance with their share in which all other beauties get their existence
and their name. But for the majority, I take it, who live all their lives with such obtuse
faculties of thinking, it is a difficult thing to perform this feat of mental analysis and of discriminating
the material vehicle from the immanent beauty, and thereby of grasping the
actual nature of the Beautiful; and if any one wants to know the exact source of all the false
and pernicious conceptions of it, he would find it in nothing else but this, viz. the absence,
in the soul’s faculties of feeling, of that exact training which would enable them to distinguish
between true Beauty and the reverse. Owing to this men give up all search after the true
Beauty. Some slide into mere sensuality. Others incline in their desires to dead metallic coin.
Others limit their imagination of the beautiful to worldly honours, fame, and power. There
is another class which is enthusiastic about art and science. The most debased make their
gluttony the test of what is good. But he who turns from all grosser thoughts and all passionate
longings after what is seeming, and explores the nature of the beauty which is simple,
immaterial, formless, would never make a mistake like that when he has to choose between
all the objects of desire; he would never be so misled by these attractions as not to see the
transient character of their pleasures and not to win his way to an utter contempt for every
one of them. This, then, is the path to lead us to the discovery of the Beautiful. All other
objects that attract men’s love, be they never so fashionable, be they prized never so much
and embraced never so eagerly, must be left below us, as too low, too fleeting, to employ
the powers of loving which we possess; not indeed that those powers are to be locked up
within us unused and motionless; but only that they must first be cleansed from all lower
longings; then we must lift them to that height to which sense can never reach. Admiration

even of the beauty of the heavens, and of the dazzling sunbeams, and, indeed, of any fair
phenomenon, will then cease. The beauty noticed there will be but as the hand to lead us to
the love of the supernal Beauty whose glory the heavens and the firmament declare, and
whose secret the whole creation sings. The climbing soul, leaving all that she has grasped
already as too narrow for her needs, will thus grasp the idea of that magnificence which is
exalted far above the heavens. But how can any one reach to this, whose ambitions creep
below? How can any one fly up into the heavens, who has not the wings of heaven and is
not already buoyant and lofty-minded by reason of a heavenly calling? Few can be such
strangers to evangelic mysteries as not to know that there is but one vehicle on which man’s
soul can mount into the heavens, viz. the self-made likeness in himself to the descending
Dove, whose wings1401 David the Prophet also longed for. This is the allegorical name used
in Scripture for the power of the Holy Spirit; whether it be because not a drop of gall1402 is
found in that bird, or because it cannot bear any noisome smell, as close observers tell us.
He therefore who keeps away from all bitterness and all the noisome effluvia of the flesh,
and raises himself on the aforesaid wings above all low earthly ambitions, or, more than
that, above the whole universe itself, will be the man to find that which is alone worth loving,
and to become himself as beautiful as the Beauty which he has touched and entered, and to
be made bright and luminous himself in the communion of the real Light. We are told by
those who have studied the subject, that those gleams which follow each other so fast through
the air at night and which some call shooting stars1403, are nothing but the air itself
streaming into the upper regions of the sky under stress of some particular blasts. They say
that the fiery track is traced along the sky when those blasts ignite in the ether. In like
manner, then, as this air round the earth is forced upwards by some blast and changes into
the pure splendour of the ether, so the mind of man leaves this murky miry world, and under
the stress of the spirit becomes pure and luminous in contact with the true and supernal

Purity; in such an atmosphere it even itself emits light, and is so filled with radiance, that it
becomes itself a Light, according to the promise of our Lord that “the righteous should shine
forth as the sun1404.” We see this even here, in the case of a mirror, or a sheet of water, or
any smooth surface that can reflect the light; when they receive the sunbeam they beam
themselves; but they would not do this if any stain marred their pure and shining surface.
We shall become then as the light, in our nearness to Christ’s true light, if we leave this dark
atmosphere of the earth and dwell above; and we shall be light, as our Lord says somewhere
to His disciples1405, if the true Light that shineth in the dark comes down even to us; unless,
that is, any foulness of sin spreading over our hearts should dim the brightness of our light.
Perhaps these examples have led us gradually on to the discovery that we can be changed
into something better than ourselves; and it has been proved as well that this union of the
soul with the incorruptible Deity can be accomplished in no other way but by herself attaining
by her virgin state to the utmost purity possible,—a state which, being like God, will enable
her to grasp that to which it is like, while she places herself like a mirror beneath the purity
of God, and moulds her own beauty at the touch and the sight of the Archetype of all beauty.
Take a character strong enough to turn from all that is human, from persons, from wealth,
from the pursuits of Art and Science, even from whatever in moral practice and in legislation
is viewed as right (for still in all of them error in the apprehension of the Beautiful comes
in, sense being the criterion); such a character will feel as a passionate lover only towards
that Beauty which has no source but Itself, which is not such at one particular time or relatively
only, which is Beautiful from, and through, and in itself, not such at one moment and
in the next ceasing to be such, above all increase and addition, incapable of change and alteration.
I venture to affirm that, to one who has cleansed all the powers of his being from
every form of vice, the Beauty which is essential, the source of every beauty and every good,
will become visible. The visual eye, purged from its blinding humour, can clearly discern
objects even on the distant sky1406; so to the soul by virtue of her innocence there comes
the power of taking in that Light; and the real Virginity, the real zeal for chastity, ends in
no other goal than this, viz. the power thereby of seeing God. No one in fact is so mentally
blind as not to understand that without telling; viz. that the God of the Universe is the only

there are those who, as might have been expected, wish besides this to discover, if possible,
a process by which we may be actually guided to it. Well, the Divine books are full of such
instruction for our guidance; and besides that many of the Saints cast the refulgence of their
own lives, like lamps, upon the path for those who are “walking with God1408.” But each
may gather in abundance for himself suggestions towards this end out of either Covenant

the Traditions of the Apostles. What we ourselves have conjectured in following out the
thoughts of those inspired utterances is this.</p>

<p>This reasoning and intelligent creature, man, at once the work and the likeness of the
Divine and Imperishable Mind (for so in the Creation it is written of him that “God made
man in His image1409”), this creature, I say, did not in the course of his first production
have united to the very essence of his nature the liability to passion and to death. Indeed,
the truth about the image could never have been maintained if the beauty reflected in that
image had been in the slightest degree opposed1410 to the Archetypal Beauty. Passion was
introduced afterwards, subsequent to man’s first organization; and it was in this way. Being
the image and the likeness, as has been said, of the Power which rules all things, man kept
also in the matter of a Free-Will this likeness to Him whose Will is over all. He was enslaved
to no outward necessity whatever; his feeling towards that which pleased him depended
only on his own private judgment; he was free to choose whatever he liked; and so he was
a free agent, though circumvented with cunning, when he drew upon himself that disaster
which now overwhelms humanity. He became himself the discoverer of evil, but he did not
therein discover what God had made; for God did not make death. Man became, in fact,
himself the fabricator, to a certain extent, and the craftsman of evil. All who have the faculty
of sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put this enjoyment from
him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not that the sun retires and produces that darkness,
but the man himself puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision
cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive1411, and so this operative
sight necessarily becomes an operative darkness1412 rising up in the man from his own free
act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself may omit to make in it
any way of entrance for the light; he will necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself
off from the light voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil
in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature
of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of
turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be
it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable
in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His “to be rejected”;
all that God made was “very good1413.” But the habit of sinning entered as we have
described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning
spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation

of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened1414 with the vicious rust, preserved no
longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing
so great and precious1415, as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his
proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their
features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this
creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable
Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to
something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the
cleansing water of this calling1416. The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul’s beauty
will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to
that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that
which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work
at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed
upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to
clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again.
This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what
Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that “the Kingdom of God is within you1417.” That
word1418 points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature,
and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each
of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of
life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If
further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested
by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma1419. The thought, there, is that the widowed
soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being
all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests
that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden
principles; then that in one’s own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that
lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet
hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impur-

ities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to
the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices
over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight.
Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names
her neighbours for this occasion1420, when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed
in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us
has stamped upon this our Drachma1421), will then be converted to that divine delight and
festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. “Rejoice with me,”
she says, “because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.” The neighbours, that is, the
soul’s familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of
anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the
finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they
should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and
do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin1422. If, then, such is the
lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the
foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the
First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was
then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God’s countenance.
He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone
all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture
signifies when it said that “he knew her not1423” till he was driven forth from the garden,
and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs
of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return
to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What
are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame,
and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in
leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and
then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for
having to die, marriage was instituted1424. Now if we are destined “to depart hence, and be
with Christ1425,” we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which lies nearest to
ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn

to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached
at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from
the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting,
is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next,
we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin.
Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely
the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret1426, and be
covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the
coatings of this life’s perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and
repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God’s commandment only,
instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what
was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in
ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason
it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as
well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from “the knowledge of good
and evil1427,” and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to
enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly
and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might
even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught
up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was
when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of1428.</p>

<p>But seeing that Paradise is the home of living spirits, and will not admit those who are
dead in sin, and that we on the other hand are fleshly, subject to death, and sold under
sin1429, how is it possible that one who is a subject of death’s empire should ever dwell in
this land where all is life? What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised?
Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to
Nicodemus, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit1430.” We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of
God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes
into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also
imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then,
results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh,
which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which
does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few
other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames
is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined
to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse;
and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children
as these “shall be saved in child-bearing1431;” as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully
cries, “He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children1432.”
Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit
conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her
modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who
think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world—I speak without
wishing to offend—is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment
of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this
process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed
have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and
death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity,
but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger
thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service
to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures.

In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened
between1433 the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It
could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage
was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with
every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to
pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who
had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces
against the fruit of her virginity as against a rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her,
so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity,
the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places
upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass,
or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death
cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for
this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions
which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse.
Whence do they get their meaning? “Widowhood,” “orphanhood,” “loss of children,” could
they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses,
and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief. The hilt of a sword
is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of
the hand1434; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at,
more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the
senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship;
but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been
wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of
loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in
the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune
from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement
from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes
on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the
delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers’ “sorrows1435” are no longer
“multiplied,” nor does “sorrow” herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed
from life and “tears wiped from off all faces1436;” conception is no more an iniquity, nor
child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more “of bloods,” or “of the will of man,” or “of

the will of the flesh1437”, but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in
a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness,
and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of
such a son; as our Lord says, “He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my
mother1438.” What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is
swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of
the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence
of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement
may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once
for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having
so far as in him lies made an end1439 of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits
thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation1440 of the great God, refraining from
putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity:
secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed
results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection
shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are
strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by
him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the
stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity
then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so
great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer
by comparison with this perfection?</p>

<p>But if we apprehend at last the perfection of this grace, we must understand as well what
necessarily follows from it; namely that it is not a single achievement, ending in the subjugation
of the body, but that in intention it reaches to and pervades everything that is, or is
considered, a right condition of the soul. That soul indeed which in virginity cleaves to the
true Bridegroom will not remove herself merely from all bodily defilement; she will make
that abstension only the beginning of her purity, and will carry this security from failure
equally into everything else upon her path. Fearing lest, from a too partial heart, she should
by contact with evil in any one direction give occasion for the least weakness of unfaithfulness
(to suppose such a case: but I will begin again what I was going to say), that soul which
cleaves to her Master so as to become with Him one spirit, and by the compact of a wedded
life has staked the love of all her heart and all her strength on Him alone—that soul will no
more commit any other of the offences contrary to salvation, than imperil her union with
Him by cleaving to fornication; she knows that between all sins there is a single kinship of
impurity, and that if she were to defile herself with but one1441, she could no longer retain
her spotlessness. An illustration will show what we mean. Suppose all the water in a pool
remaining smooth and motionless, while no disturbance of any kind comes to mar the
peacefulness of the spot; and then a stone thrown into the pool; the movement in that one
part1442 will extend to the whole, and while the stone’s weight is carrying it to the bottom,
the waves that are set in motion round it pass in circles1443 into others, and so through all
the intervening commotion are pushed on to the very edge of the water, and the whole
surface is ruffled with these circles, feeling the movement of the depths. So is the broad
serenity and calm of the soul troubled by one invading passion, and affected by the injury
of a single part. They tell us too, those who have investigated the subject, that the virtues
are not disunited from each other, and that to grasp the principle of any one virtue will be
impossible to one who has not seized that which underlies the rest, and that the man who
shows one virtue in his character will necessarily show them all. Therefore, by contraries,
the depravation of anything in our moral nature will extend to the whole virtuous life; and
in very truth, as the Apostle tells us, the whole is affected by the parts, and “if one member1444
suffer, all the members suffer with it,” “if one be honoured, all rejoice.”</p>

<p>But the ways in our life which turn aside towards sin are innumerable; and their number
is told by Scripture in divers manners. “Many are they that trouble me and persecute,” and
“Many are they that fight against me from on high1445”; and many other texts like that. We
may affirm, indeed, absolutely, that many are they who plot in the adulterer’s fashion to
destroy this truly honourable marriage, and to defile this inviolate bed; and if we must name
them one by one, we charge with this adulterous spirit anger, avarice, envy, revenge, enmity,
malice, hatred, and whatever the Apostle puts in the class of those things which are contrary
to sound doctrine. Now let us suppose a lady, prepossessing and lovely above her peers, and
on that account wedded to a king, but besieged because of her beauty by profligate lovers.
As long as she remains indignant at these would-be seducers and complains of them to her
lawful husband, she keeps her chastity and has no one before her eyes but her bridegroom;
the profligates find no vantage ground for their attack upon her. But if she were to listen to
a single one of them, her chastity with regard to the rest would not exempt her from the
retribution; it would be sufficient to condemn her, that she had allowed that one to defile
the marriage bed. So the soul whose life is in God will find her pleasure1446 in no single one
of those things which make a beauteous show to deceive her. If she were, in some fit of
weakness, to admit the defilement to her heart, she would herself have broken the covenant
of her spiritual marriage; and, as the Scripture tells us, “into the malicious soul Wisdom
cannot come1447.” It may, in a word, be truly said that the Good Husband cannot come to
dwell with the soul that is irascible, or malice-bearing, or harbours any other disposition
which jars with that concord. No way has been discovered of harmonizing things whose
nature is antagonistic and which have nothing in common. The Apostle tells us there is “no
communion of light with darkness1448,” or of righteousness with iniquity, or, in a word, of
all the qualities which we perceive and name as the essence of God’s nature, with all the
opposite which are perceived in evil. Seeing, then, the impossibility of any union between
mutual repellents, we understand that the vicious soul is estranged from entertaining the
company of the Good. What then is the practical lesson from this? The chaste and
thoughtful virgin must sever herself from any affection which can in any way impart conta-

their minds, and ever fits them to perform the service of prayer. Belonging to some of the gods now in vogue
there are certainly virgins here and there—watched or not I care not now to inquire—who seem not to break
down in the course of chastity which the honour of their god requires. But amongst Christians, for no repute
amongst men, for no stipend, for no mere show, they practise an absolute virginity; and as they ‘liked to retain
God in their knowledge,’ so God has kept them in that liking mind, and in the performance of fitting works,
filling them with righteousness and goodness. I say this without any depreciation of what is beautiful in Greek
thought, and of what is wholesome in their teachings. I wish only to show that all they have said, and things
more noble, more divine, have been said by those men of God, the prophets and apostles.”</note>

<p>There is only one right path. It is narrow and contracted. It has no turnings either on
the one side or the other. No matter how we leave it, there is the same danger of straying
hopelessly away. This being so, the habit which many have got into must be as far as possible
corrected; those, I mean, who while they fight strenuously against the baser pleasures, yet
still go on hunting for pleasure in the shape of worldly honour and positions which will
gratify their love of power. They act like some domestic who longed for liberty, but instead
of exerting himself to get away from slavery proceeded only to change his masters, and
thought liberty consisted in that change. But all alike are slaves, even though they should
not all go on being ruled by the same masters, as long as a dominion of any sort, with power
to enforce it, is set over them. There are others again who after a long battle against all the
pleasures1450, yield themselves easily on another field, where feelings of an opposite kind
come in; and in the intense exactitude of their lives fall a ready prey to melancholy and irritation,
and to brooding over injuries, and to everything that is the direct opposite of pleasurable
feelings; from which they are very reluctant to extricate themselves. This is always
happening, whenever any emotion, instead of virtuous reason, controls the course of a life.
For the commandment of the Lord is exceedingly far-shining, so as to “enlighten the eyes”
even of “the simple1451,” declaring that good cleaveth only unto God. But God is not pain
any more than He is pleasure; He is not cowardice any more than boldness; He is not fear,
nor anger, nor any other emotion which sways the untutored soul, but, as the Apostle says,
He is Very Wisdom and Sanctification, Truth and Joy and Peace, and everything like that.
If He is such, how can any one be said to cleave to Him, who is mastered by the very opposite?
Is it not want of reason in any one to suppose that when he has striven successfully to escape
the dominion of one particular passion, he will find virtue in its opposite? For instance, to
suppose that when he has escaped pleasure, he will find virtue in letting pain have possession
of him; or when he has by an effort remained proof against anger, in crouching with fear.
It matters not whether we miss virtue, or rather God Himself Who is the Sum of virtue, in
this way, or in that. Take the case of great bodily prostration; one would say that the sadness
of this failure was just the same, whether the cause has been excessive under-feeding, or
immoderate eating; both failures to stop in time end in the same result. He therefore who
watches over the life and the sanity of the soul will confine himself to the moderation of the
truth; he will continue without touching either of those opposite states which run alongside
virtue. This teaching is not mine; it comes from the Divine lips. It is clearly contained
in that passage where our Lord says to His disciples, that they are as sheep wandering amongst

wolves1452, yet are not to be as doves only, but are to have something of the serpent too in
their disposition; and that means that they should neither carry to excess the practice of that
which seems praiseworthy in simplicity1453, as such a habit would come very near to
downright madness, nor on the other hand should deem the cleverness which most admire
to be a virtue, while unsoftened by any mixture with its opposite; they were in fact to form
another disposition, by a compound of these two seeming opposites, cutting off its silliness
from the one, its evil cunning from the other; so that one single beautiful character should
be created from the two, a union of simplicity of purpose with shrewdness. “Be ye,” He says,
“wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”</p>

<p>Let that which was then said by our Lord be the general maxim for every life; especially
let it be the maxim for those who are coming nearer God through the gateway of virginity,
that they should never in watching for a perfection in one direction present an unguarded
side in another and contrary one; but should in all directions realize the good, so that they
may guarantee in all things their holy life against failure. A soldier does not arm himself
only on some points, leaving the rest of his body to take its chance unprotected. If he were
to receive his death-wound upon that, what would have been the advantage of this partial
armour? Again, who would call that feature faultless, which from some accident had lost
one of those requisites which go to make up the sum of beauty? The disfigurement of the
mutilated part mars the grace of the part untouched. The Gospel implies that he who undertakes
the building of a tower, but spends all his labour upon the foundations without ever
reaching the completion, is worthy of ridicule; and what else do we learn from the Parable
of the Tower, but to strive to come to the finish of every lofty purpose, accomplishing the
work of God in all the multiform structures of His commandments? One stone, indeed, is
no more the whole edifice of the Tower, than one commandment kept will raise the soul’s
perfection to the required height. The foundation must by all means first be laid but over
it, as the Apostle says1454, the edifice of gold and precious gems must be built; for so is the
doing of the commandment put by the Prophet who cries, “I have loved Thy commandment
above gold and many a precious stone1455.” Let the virtuous life have for its substructure
the love of virginity; but upon this let every result of virtue be reared. If virginity is believed
to be a vastly precious thing and to have a divine look (as indeed is the case, as well as men
believe of it), yet, if the whole life does not harmonize with this perfect note, and it be marred
by the succeeding1456 discord of the soul, this thing becomes but “the jewel of gold in the

<p>If any one supposes that1458 this want of mutual harmony between his life and a single
one of its circumstances is quite unimportant, let him be taught the meaning of our maxim
by looking at the management of a house. The master of a private dwelling will not allow
any untidiness or unseemliness to be seen in the house, such as a couch upset, or the table
littered with rubbish, or vessels of price thrown away into dirty corners, while those which
serve ignobler uses are thrust forward for entering guests to see. He has everything arranged
neatly and in the proper place, where it stands to most advantage; and then he can welcome
his guests, without any misgivings that he need be ashamed of opening the interior of his
house to receive them. The same duty, I take it, is incumbent on that master of our “tabernacle,”
the mind; it has to arrange everything within us, and to put each particular faculty
of the soul, which the Creator has fashioned to be our implement or our vessel, to fitting
and noble uses. We will now mention in detail the way in which any one might manage his
life, with its present advantages, to his improvement, hoping that no one will accuse us of
trifling1459, or over-minuteness. We advise, then, that love’s passion be placed in the soul’s
purest shrine, as a thing chosen to be the first fruits of all our gifts, and devoted1460 entirely
to God; and when once this has been done, to keep it untouched and unsullied by any secular
defilement. Then indignation, and anger, and hatred must be as watch-dogs to be roused
only against attacking sins; they must follow their natural impulse only against the thief and
the enemy who is creeping in to plunder the divine treasure-chamber, and who comes only
for that, that he may steal, and mangle, and destroy. Courage and confidence are to be
weapons in our hands to baffle any sudden surprise and attack of the wicked who advance.
Hope and patience are to be the staffs to lean upon, whenever we are weary with the trials
of the world. As for sorrow, we must have a stock of it ready to apply, if need should happen
to arise for it, in the hour of repentance for our sins; believing at the same time that it is
never useful, except to minister to that. Righteousness will be our rule of straightforwardness,
guarding us from stumbling either in word or deed, and guiding us in the disposal of the
faculties of our soul, as well as in the due consideration for every one we meet. The love of
gain, which is a large, incalculably large, element in every soul, when once applied to the
desire for God, will bless the man who has it; for he will be violent1461 where it is right to
be violent. Wisdom and prudence will be our advisers as to our best interests; they will order
our lives so as never to suffer from any thoughtless folly. But suppose a man does not apply
the aforesaid faculties of the soul to their proper use, but reverses their intended purpose;

suppose he wastes his love upon the basest objects, and stores up his hatred only for his own
kinsmen; suppose he welcomes iniquity, plays the man only against his parents, is bold only
in absurdities, fixes his hopes on emptiness, chases prudence and wisdom from his company,
takes gluttony and folly for his mistresses, and uses all his other opportunities in the same
fashion, he would indeed be a strange and unnatural character to a degree beyond any one’s
power to express. If we could imagine any one putting his armour on all the wrong way,
reversing the helmet so as to cover his face while the plume nodded backward, putting his
feet into the cuirass, and fitting the greaves on to his breast, changing to the right side all
that ought to go on the left and vice versa, and how such a hoplite would be likely to fare in
battle, then we should have an idea of the fate in life which is sure to await him whose confused
judgment makes him reverse the proper uses of his soul’s faculties. We must therefore
provide this balance in all feeling; the true sobriety of mind is naturally able to supply it;
and if one had to find an exact definition of this sobriety, one might declare absolutely, that
it amounts to our ordered control, by dint of wisdom and prudence, over every emotion of
the soul. Moreover, such a condition in the soul will be no longer in need of any laborious
method to attain to the high and heavenly realities; it will accomplish with the greatest ease
that which erewhile seemed so unattainable; it will grasp the object of its search as a natural
consequence of rejecting the opposite attractions. A man who comes out of darkness is necessarily
in the light; a man who is not dead is necessarily alive. Indeed, if a man is not to
have received his soul to no purpose1462, he will certainly be upon the path of truth; the
prudence and the science employed to guard against error will be itself a sure guidance along
the right road. Slaves who have been freed and cease to serve their former masters, the very
moment they become their own masters, direct all their thoughts towards themselves so, I
take it, the soul which has been freed from ministering to the body becomes at once cognizant
of its own inherent energy. But this liberty consists, as we learn from the Apostle1463, in not
again being held in the yoke of slavery, and in not being bound again, like a runaway or a
criminal, with the fetters of marriage. But I must return here to what I said at first; that the
perfection of this liberty does not consist only in that one point of abstaining from marriage.
Let no one suppose that the prize of virginity is so insignificant and so easily won as that;
as if one little observance of the flesh could settle so vital a matter. But we have seen that
every man who doeth a sin is the servant of sin1464; so that a declension towards vice in any
act, or in any practice whatever, makes a slave, and still more, a branded slave, of the man,
covering him through sin’s lashes with bruises and seared spots. Therefore it behoves the

man who grasps at the transcendent aim of all virginity to be true to himself in every respect,
and to manifest his purity equally in every relation of his life. If any of the inspired words
are required to aid our pleading, the Truth1465 Itself will be sufficient to corroborate the
truth when It inculcates this very kind of teaching in the veiled meaning of a Gospel Parable:
the good and eatable fish are separated by the fishers’ skill from the bad and poisonous fish,
so that the enjoyment of the good should not be spoilt by any of the bad getting into the
“vessels” with them. The work of true sobriety is the same; from all pursuits and habits to
choose that which is pure and improving, rejecting in every case that which does not seem
likely to be useful, and letting it go back into the universal and secular life, called “the sea1466,”
in the imagery of the Parable. The Psalmist1467 also, when expounding the doctrine of a full
confession1468, calls this restless suffering tumultuous life, “waters coming in even unto the
soul,” “depths of waters,” and a “hurricane”; in which sea indeed every rebellious thought
sinks, as the Egyptian did, with a stone’s weight into the deeps1469. But all in us that is dear
to God, and has a piercing insight into the truth (called “Israel” in the narrative), passes,
but that alone, over that sea as if it were dry land, and is never reached by the bitterness and
the brine of life’s billows. Thus, typically, under the leadership of the Law (for Moses was a
type of the Law that was coming) Israel passes unwetted over that sea, while the Egyptian
who crosses in her track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition which he
carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For
virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in her way “fly like clouds1470,” as Isaiah
says, “and as doves with their young ones”; but sin is a heavy affair, “sitting,” as another of
the prophets says, “upon a talent of lead1471.” If, however, this reading of the history appears
to any forced and inapplicable, and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him
as written for our profit, let him listen to the Apostle: “Now all these things happened unto
them for types, and they are written for our admonition1472.”</p>

<p>But besides other things the action of Miriam the prophetess also gives rise to these
surmisings of ours. Directly the sea was crossed she took in her hand a dry and sounding
timbrel and conducted the women’s dance1473. By this timbrel the story may mean to imply
virginity, as first perfected by Miriam; whom indeed I would believe to be a type of Mary
the mother of God1474. Just as the timbrel emits a loud sound because it is devoid of all
moisture and reduced to the highest degree of dryness, so has virginity a clear and ringing
report amongst men because it repels from itself the vital sap of merely physical life. Thus,
Miriam’s timbrel being a dead thing, and virginity being a deadening of the bodily passions,
it is perhaps not very far removed from the bounds of probability1475 that Miriam was a
virgin. However, we can but guess and surmise, we cannot clearly prove, that this was so,
and that Miriam the prophetess led a dance of virgins, even though many of the learned
have affirmed distinctly that she was unmarried, from the fact that the history makes no
mention either of her marriage or of her being a mother; and surely she would have been
named and known, not as “the sister of Aaron1476,” but from her husband, if she had had
one; since the head of the woman is not the brother but the husband. But if, amongst a
people with whom motherhood was sought after and classed as a blessing and regarded as
a public duty, the grace of virginity, nevertheless, came to be regarded as a precious thing,
how does it behove us to feel towards it, who do not “judge” of the Divine blessings1477
“according to the flesh”? Indeed it has been revealed in the oracles of God, on what occasion
to conceive and to bring forth is a good thing, and what species of fecundity was desired by
God’s saints; for both the Prophet Isaiah and the divine Apostle have made this clear and
certain. The one cries, “From fear of Thee, O Lord, have I conceived1478;” the other boasts
that he is the parent of the largest family of any, bringing to the birth whole cities and nations;
not the Corinthians and Galatians only whom by his travailings he moulded for the Lord,
but all in the wide circuit from Jerusalem to Illyricum; his children filled the world, “begotten”

which ministered to an Immaculate Birth, is pronounced blessed in the Gospel1480; for that
birth did not annul the Virginity, nor did the Virginity impede so great a birth. When the
“spirit of salvation1481,” as Isaiah names it, is being born, the willings of the flesh are useless.
There is also a particular teaching of the Apostle, which harmonizes with this; viz. each man
of us is a double man1482; one the outwardly visible, whose natural fate it is to decay; the
other perceptible only in the secret of the heart, yet capable of renovation. If this teaching
is true,—and it must be true1483 because Wisdom is speaking there,—then there is no absurdity
in supposing a double marriage also which answers in every detail to either man;
and, maybe, if one was to assert boldly that the body’s virginity was the co-operator and the
agent of the inward marriage, this assertion would not be much beside the probable fact.</p>

<p>Now it is impossible, as far as manual exercise goes, to ply two arts at once; for instance,
husbandry and sailing, or tinkering and carpentering. If one is to be honestly taken in hand,
the other must be left alone. Just so, there are these two marriages for our choice, the one
effected in the flesh, the other in the spirit; and preoccupation in the one must cause of necessity
alienation from the other. No more is the eye able to look at two objects at once; but
it must concentrate its special attention on one at a time; no more can the tongue effect utterances
in two different languages, so as to pronounce, for instance, a Hebrew word and a
Greek word in the same moment: no more can the ear take in at one and the same time a
narrative of facts, and a hortatory discourse; if each special tone is heard separately, it will
impress its ideas upon the hearers’ minds; but if they are combined and so poured into the
ear, an inextricable confusion of ideas will be the result, one meaning being mutually lost
in the other: and no more, by analogy, do our emotional powers possess a nature which can
at once pursue the pleasures of sense and court the spiritual union; nor, besides, can both
those ends be gained by the same courses of life; continence, mortification of the passions,
scorn of fleshly needs, are the agents of the one union; but all that are the reverse of these
are the agents of bodily habitation. As, when two masters are before us to choose between,
and we cannot be subject to both, for “no man can serve two masters1484,” he who is wise
will choose the one most useful to himself, so, when two marriages are before us to choose
between, and we cannot contract both, for “he that is unmarried cares for the things of the
Lord, but he that is married careth for the things of the world1485,” I repeat that it would
be the aim of a sound mind not to miss choosing the more profitable one; and not to be ignorant
either of the way which will lead it to this, a way which cannot be learnt but by some
such comparison as the following. In the case of a marriage of this world a man who is
anxious to avoid appearing altogether insignificant pays the greatest attention both to
physical health, and becoming adornment, and amplitude of means and the security from
any disgraceful revelations as to his antecedents or his parentage; for so he thinks things
will be most likely to turn out as he wishes. Now just in the same way the man who is
courting the spiritual alliance will first of all display himself, by the renewal of his mind1486,
a young man, without a single touch of age upon him; next he will reveal a lineage rich in
that in which it is a noble ambition to be rich, not priding himself on worldly wealth, but
luxuriating only in the heavenly treasures. As for family distinction, he will not vaunt that
which comes by the mere routine of devolution even to numbers of the worthless, but that
which is gained by the successful efforts of his own zeal and labours; a distinction which

<pb n="682"/>
only those can boast of who are “sons of the light” and children of God, and are styled
“nobles from the sunrise1487” because of their splendid deeds. Strength and health he will
not try to gain by bodily training and feeding, but by all that is the contrary of this, perfecting
the spirit’s strength in the body’s weakness. I could tell also of the suitor’s gifts to the bride
in such a wedding1488; they are not procured by the money that perishes, but are contributed
out of the wealth peculiar to the soul. Would you know their names? You must hear from
Paul, that excellent adorner of the Bride1489, in what the wealth of those consists who in
everything commend themselves. He mentions much else that is priceless in it, and adds,
“in chastity1490”; and besides this all the recognized fruits of the spirit from any quarter
whatever are gifts of this marriage. If a man is going to carry out the advice of Solomon and
take for helpmate and life-companion that true Wisdom of which he says, “Love her, and
she shall keep thee,” “honour her, that she may embrace thee1491,” then he will prepare
himself in a manner worthy of such a love, so as to feast with all the joyous wedding guests
in spotless raiment, and not be cast forth, while claiming to sit at that feast, for not having
put on the wedding garment. It is plain moreover that the argument applies equally to men
and women, to move them towards such a marriage. “There is neither male nor female1492,”
the Apostle says; “Christ is all, and in all1493”; and so it is equally reasonable that he who is
enamoured of wisdom should hold the Object of his passionate desire, Who is the True
Wisdom; and that the soul which cleaves to the undying Bridegroom should have the fruition
of her love for the true Wisdom, which is God. We have now sufficiently revealed the nature
of the spiritual union, and the Object of the pure and heavenly Love.
1487 See S. Matt. viii. 11; S. Luke xiii. 29. The same expression (εὐγενὴς τῶν ἀφ᾽ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν) is used

<p>It is perfectly clear that no one can come near the purity of the Divine Being who has
not first himself become such; he must therefore place between himself and the pleasures
of the senses a high strong wall of separation, so that in this his approach to the Deity the
purity of his own heart may not become soiled again. Such an impregnable wall will be
found in a complete estrangement from everything wherein passion operates.</p>
<p>Now pleasure is one in kind, as we learn from the experts; as water parted into various
channels from one single fountain, it spreads itself over the pleasure-lover through the
various avenues of the senses; so that it has been on his heart that the man, who through
any one particular sensation succumbs to the resulting pleasure, has received a wound from
that sensation. This accords with the teaching given from the Divine lips, that “he who has
satisfied the lust of the eyes has received the mischief already in his heart1494”; for I take it
that our Lord was speaking in that particular example of any of the senses; so that we might
well carry on His saying, and add, “He who hath heard, to lust after,” and what follows, “He
who hath touched to lust after,” “He who hath lowered any faculty within us to the service
of pleasure, hath sinned in his heart.”</p>
<p>To prevent this, then, we want to apply to our own lives that rule of all temperance,
never to let the mind dwell on anything wherein pleasure’s bait is hid; but above all to be
specially watchful against the pleasure of taste. For that seems in a way the most deeply
rooted, and to be the mother as it were of all forbidden enjoyment. The pleasures of eating
and drinking, leading to boundless excess, inflict upon the body the doom of the most
dreadful sufferings1495; for over-indulgence is the parent of most of the painful diseases.
To secure for the body a continuous tranquillity, unstirred by the pains of surfeit, we must
make up our minds to a more sparing regimen, and constitute the need of it on each occasion
not the pleasure of it, as the measure and limit of our indulgence. If the sweetness will nevertheless
mingle itself with the satisfaction of the need (for hunger knows how to sweeten
everything1496, and by the vehemence of appetite she gives the zest of pleasure to every
discoverable supply of the need), we must not because of the resulting enjoyment reject the
satisfaction, nor yet make this latter our leading aim. In everything we must select the expedient
quantity, and leave untouched what merely feasts the senses1497.</p>

<p>We see how the husbandmen have a method for separating the chaff, which is united
with the wheat, with a view to employ each for its proper purpose, the one for the sustenance
of man, the other for burning and the feeding of animals. The labourer in the field of temperance
will in like manner distinguish the satisfaction from the mere delight, and will fling
this latter nature to savages1498 “whose end is to be burned1499,” as the Apostle says, but
will take the other, in proportion to the actual need, with thankfulness. Many, however,
slide into the very opposite kind of excess, and unconsciously to themselves, in their overpreciseness,
laboriously thwart their own design; they let their soul fall down the other side
from the heights of Divine elevation to the level of dull thoughts and occupations, where
their minds are so bent upon regulations which merely affect the body, that they can no
longer walk in their heavenly freedom and gaze above; their only inclination is to this tormenting
and afflicting of the flesh. It would be well, then, to give this also careful thought,
so as to be equally on our guard against either over-amount1500, neither stifling the mind
beneath the wound of the flesh, nor, on the other hand, by gratuitously inflicted weakenings
sapping and lowering the powers, so that it can have no thought but of the body’s pain1501;
and let every one remember that wise precept, which warns us from turning to the right
hand or to the left. I have heard a certain physician of my acquaintance, in the course of
explaining the secrets of his art, say that our body consists of four elements, not of the same
species, but disposed to be conflicting: yet the hot penetrated the cold, and an equally unexpected
union of the wet and the dry took place, the contradictories of each pair being brought
into contact by their relationship to the intervening pair. He added an extremely subtle explanation
of this account of his studies in nature. Each of these elements was in its essence
diametrically1502 opposed to its contradictory; but then it had two other qualities lying on
each side of it, and by virtue of its kinship with them it came into contact with its contradictory;
for example, the cold and the hot each unite with the wet, or the dry; and again, the wet
and the dry each unite with the hot, or the cold: and so this sameness of quality, when it

What business of mine, however, is it to explain exactly the details of this change

purpose was to add that the author of this analysis of the body’s constitution advised that
all possible care be taken to preserve a balance between these properties, for that in fact
health consisted in not letting any one of them gain the mastery within us. If his doctrine
has truth in it, then, for our health’s continuance, we must secure such a habit, and by no
irregularity of diet produce either an excess or a defect in any member of these our constituent
elements. The chariot-master, if the young horses which he has to drive will not work well

with cuts of his whip, till he has made them all breathe evenly together in a straight career.
Now our mind in like manner holds in its grasp the reins of this chariot of the body; and in
that capacity it will not devise, in the time of youth, when heat of temperament is abundant,
ways of heightening that fever; nor will it multiply the cooling and the thinning things when
the body is already chilled by illness or by time; and in the case of all these physical qualities
it will be guided by the Scripture, so as actually to realize it: “He that gathered much had
nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack1503.” It will curtail immoderate
lengths in either direction, and so will be careful to replenish where there is much lack. The
inefficiency of the body from either cause will be that which it guards against; it will train
the flesh, neither making it wild and ungovernable by excessive pampering, nor sickly and
unstrung and nerveless for the required work by immoderate mortification. That is temperance’s
highest aim; it looks not to the afflicting of the body, but to the peaceful action of the
soul’s functions.</p>

<p>Now the details of the life of him who has chosen to live in such a philosophy as this,
the things to be avoided, the exercises to be engaged in, the rules of temperance, the whole
method of the training, and all the daily regimen which contributes towards this great end,
has been dealt with in certain written manuals of instruction for the benefit of those who
love details. Yet there is a plainer guide to be found than verbal instruction; and that is
practice: and there is nothing vexatious in the maxim that when we are undertaking a long
journey or voyage we should get an instructor. “But,” says the Apostle1504, “the word is nigh
thee;” the grace begins at home; there is the manufactory of all the virtues; there this life has
become exquisitely refined by a continual progress towards consummate perfection; there,
whether men are silent or whether they speak, there is large opportunity for being instructed
in this heavenly citizenship through the actual practice of it. Any theory divorced from living
examples, however admirably it may be dressed out, is like the unbreathing statue, with its
show of a blooming complexion impressed in tints and colours; but the man who acts as
well as teaches, as the Gospel tells us, he is the man who is truly living, and has the bloom
of beauty, and is efficient and stirring. It is to him that we must go, if we mean, according
to the saying1505 of Scripture, to “retain” virginity. One who wants to learn a foreign language
is not a competent instructor of himself; he gets himself taught by experts, and can then talk
with foreigners. So, for this high life, which does not advance in nature’s groove, but is estranged
from her by the novelty of its course, a man cannot be instructed thoroughly unless
he puts himself into the hands of one who has himself led it in perfection; and indeed in all
the other professions of life the candidate is more likely to achieve success if he gets from
tutors a scientific knowledge of each part of the subject of his choice, than if he undertook
to study it by himself; and this particular profession1506 is not one where everything is so
clear that judgment as to our best course in it is necessarily left to ourselves; it is one where
to hazard a step into the unknown at once brings us into danger. The science of medicine
once did not exist; it has come into being by the experiments which men have made, and
has gradually been revealed through their various observations; the healing and the harmful

drug became known from the attestation of those who had tried them, and this distinction
was adopted into the theory of the art, so that the close observation of former practitioners
became a precept for those who succeeded; and now any one who studies to attain this art
is under no necessity to ascertain at his own peril the power of any drug, whether it be a
poison or a medicine; he has only to learn from others the known facts, and may then
practise with success. It is so also with that medicine of the soul, philosophy, from which
we learn the remedy for every weakness that can touch the soul. We need not hunt after a
knowledge of these remedies by dint of guess-work and surmisings; we have abundant
means of learning them from him who by a long and rich experience has gained the possession
which we seek. In any matter youth is generally a giddy1507 guide; and it would not be
easy to find anything of importance succeeding, in which gray hairs have not been called
in to share in the deliberations. Even in all other undertakings we must, in proportion to
their greater importance, take the more precaution against failure; for in them too the
thoughtless designs of youth have brought loss; on property, for instance; or have compelled
the surrender of a position in the world, and even of renown. But in this mighty and sublime
ambition it is not property, or secular glory lasting for its hour, or any external fortune, that
is at stake;—of such things1508, whether they settle themselves well or the reverse, the wise
take small account;—here rashness can affect the soul itself; and we run the awful hazard,
not of losing any of those other things whose recovery even may perhaps be possible, but
of ruining our very selves and making the soul a bankrupt. A man who has spent or lost his
patrimony does not despair, as long as he is in the land of the living, of perchance coming
again through contrivances into his former competence; but the man who has ejected himself
from this calling, deprives himself as well of all hope of a return to better things. Therefore,
since most embrace virginity while still young and unformed in understanding, this before
anything else should be their employment, to search out a fitting guide and master of this
way, lest, in their present ignorance, they should wander from the direct route, and strike
out new paths of their own in trackless wilds1509. “Two are better than one,” says the
Preacher1510; but a single one is easily vanquished by the foe who infests the path which

to help him up1511.” Some ere now in their enthusiasm for the stricter life have shown a
dexterous alacrity; but, as if in the very moment of their choice they had already touched
perfection, their pride has had a shocking fall1512, and they have been tripped up from madly
deluding themselves into thinking that that to which their own mind inclined them was the
true beauty. In this number are those whom Wisdom calls the “slothful ones1513,” who bestrew
their “way” with “thorns”; who think it a moral loss to be anxious about keeping the
commandments; who erase from their own minds the Apostolic teaching, and instead of
eating the bread of their own honest earning fix on that of others, and make their idleness
itself into an art of living. From this number, too, come the Dreamers, who put more faith
in the illusions of their dreams1514 than in the Gospel teaching, and style their own phantasies
“revelations.” Hence, too, those who “creep into the houses”; and again others who
suppose virtue to consist in savage bearishness, and have never known the fruits of longsuffering
and humility of spirit. Who could enumerate all the pitfalls into which any one
might slip, from refusing to have recourse to men of godly celebrity? Why, we have known
ascetics of this class who have persisted in their fasting even unto death, as if “with such
sacrifices God were well pleased1515;” and, again, others who rush off into the extreme diametrically
opposite, practising celibacy in name only and leading a life in no way different
from the secular; for they not only indulge in the pleasures of the table, but are openly known
to have a woman in their houses1516; and they call such a friendship a brotherly affection,
as if, forsooth, they could veil their own thought, which is inclined to evil, under a sacred
term. It is owing to them that this pure and holy profession of virginity is “blasphemed
amongst the Gentiles1517.”</p>

<p>It would therefore be to their profit, for the young to refrain from laying down1518 for
themselves their future course in this profession; and indeed, examples of holy lives for them
to follow are not wanting in the living generation1519. Now, if ever before, saintliness abounds
and penetrates our world; by gradual advances it has reached the highest mark of perfectness;
and one who follows such footsteps in his daily rounds may catch this halo; one who tracks
the scent of this preceding perfume may be drenched in the sweet odours of Christ Himself.
As, when one torch has been fired, flame is transmitted to all the neighbouring candlesticks,
without either the first light being lessened or blazing with unequal brilliance on the other
points where it has been caught; so the saintliness of a life is transmitted from him who has
achieved it, to those who come within his circle; for there is truth in the Prophet’s saying1520,
that one who lives with a man who is “holy” and “clean” and “elect,” will become such
himself. If you would wish to know the sure signs, which will secure you the real model, it
is not hard to take a sketch from life. If you see a man so standing between death and life,
as to select from each helps for the contemplative course, never letting death’s stupor paralyze
his zeal to keep all the commandments, nor yet placing both feet in the world of the living,
since he has weaned himself from secular ambitions;—a man who remains more insensate
than the dead themselves to everything that is found on examination to be living for the
flesh, but instinct with life and energy and strength in the achievements of virtue, which are
the sure marks of the spiritual life;—then look to that man for the rule of your life; let him
be the leading light of your course of devotion, as the constellations that never set are to the
pilot; imitate his youth and his gray hairs: or, rather, imitate the old man and the stripling
who are joined in him; for even now in his declining years time has not blunted the keen
activity of his soul, nor was his youth active in the sphere of youth’s well-known employments;
in both seasons of life he has shown a wonderful combination of opposites, or rather
an exchange of the peculiar qualities of each; for in age he shows, in the direction of the
good, a young man’s energy, while, in the hours of youth, in the direction of evil, his passions
were powerless. If you wish to know what were the passions of that glorious youth of his,
you will have for your imitation the intensity and glow of his godlike love of wisdom, which

grew with him from his childhood, and has continued with him into his old age. But if you
cannot gaze upon him, as the weak-sighted cannot gaze upon the sun, at all events watch
that band of holy men who are ranged beneath him, and who by the illumination of their
lives are a model for this age. God has placed them as a beacon for us who live around; many
among them have been young men there in their prime, and have grown gray in the unbroken
practice of continence and temperance; they were old in reasonableness before their time,
and in character outstripped their years. The only love they tasted was that of wisdom; not
that their natural instincts were different from the rest; for in all alike “the flesh lusteth
against the spirit1521;” but they listened to some purpose to him who said that Temperance
“is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her1522;” and they sailed across the swelling billows
of existence upon this tree of life, as upon a skiff; and anchored in the haven of the will of
God; enviable now after so fair a voyage, they rest their souls in that sunny cloudless calm.
They now ride safe themselves at the anchor of a good hope, far out of reach of the tumult
of the billows; and for others who will follow they radiate the splendour of their lives as
beacon-fires on some high watch-tower. We have indeed a mark to guide us safely over the
ocean of temptations; and why make the too curious inquiry, whether some with such
thoughts as these have not fallen nevertheless, and why therefore despair, as if the achievement
was beyond your reach? Look on him who has succeeded, and boldly launch upon
the voyage with confidence that it will be prosperous, and sail on under the breeze of the
Holy Spirit with Christ your pilot and with the oarage of good cheer1523. For those who “go
down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters” do not let the shipwreck
that has befallen some one else prevent their being of good cheer; they rather shield their
hearts in this very confidence, and so sweep on to accomplish their successful feat. Surely
it is the most absurd thing in the world to reprobate him who has slipped in a course which
requires the greatest nicety, while one considers those who all their lives have been growing
old in failures and in errors, to have chosen the better part. If one single approach to sin is
such an awful thing that you deem it safer not to take in hand at all this loftier aim, how
much more awful a thing it is to make sin the practice of a whole life, and to remain thereby
absolutely ignorant of the purer course! How can you in your full life obey the Crucified?
How can you, hale in sin, obey Him Who died to sin? How can you, who are not crucified
to the world, and will not accept the mortification of the flesh, obey Him Who bids you
follow after Him, and Who bore the Cross in His own body, as a trophy from the foe? How
can you obey Paul when he exhorts you “to present your body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
unto God1524,” when you are “conformed to this world,” and not transformed by the

renewing of your mind, when you are not “walking” in this “newness of life,” but still pursuing
the routine of “the old man”? How can you be a priest unto God1525, anointed though
you are for this very office, to offer a gift to God; a gift in no way another’s, no counterfeited
gift from sources outside yourself, but a gift that is really your own, namely, “the inner
man1526,” who must be perfect and blameless, as it is required of a lamb to be without spot
or blemish? How can you offer this to God, when you do not listen to the law forbidding
the unclean to offer sacrifices? If you long for God to manifest Himself to you, why do you
not hear Moses, when he commands the people to be pure from the stains of marriage, that
they may take in the vision of God.1527 If this all seems little in your eyes, to be crucified
with Christ, to present yourself a sacrifice to God, to become a priest unto the most high
God, to make yourself worthy of the vision of the Almighty, what higher blessings than
these can we imagine for you, if indeed you make light of the consequences of these as well?
And the consequence of being crucified with Christ is that we shall live with Him, and be
glorified with Him, and reign with Him; and the consequence of presenting ourselves to
God is that we shall be changed from the rank of human nature and human dignity to that
of Angels; for so speaks Daniel, that “thousand thousands stood before him1528.” He too
who has taken his share in the true priesthood and placed himself beside the Great High
Priest remains altogether himself a priest for ever, prevented for eternity from remaining
any more in death. To say, again, that one makes oneself worthy to see God, produces no
less a result than this; that one is made worthy to see God. Indeed, the crown of every hope,
and of every desire, of every blessing, and of every promise of God, and of all those unspeakable
delights which we believe to exist beyond our perception and our knowledge,—the
crowning result of them all, I say, is this. Moses longed earnestly to see it, and many
prophets and kings have desired to see the same: but the only class deemed worthy of it are
the pure in heart, those who are, and are named “blessed,” for this very reason, that “they
shall see God1529.” Wherefore we would that you too should become crucified with Christ,
a holy priest standing before God, a pure offering in all chastity, preparing yourself by your
own holiness for God’s coming; that you also may have a pure heart in which to see God,
according to the promise of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Every essayist and every pamphleteer will have you, most Excellent, to display his eloquence
upon; your wondrous qualities will be a broad race-course wherein he may expatiate.
A noble and suggestive subject in able hands has indeed a way of making a grander style,
lifting it to the height of the great reality. We, however, like an aged horse, will remain outside
this proposed race-course, only turning the ear to listen for the contest waged in celebrating
your praises, if the sound of any literary car careering in full swing through such wonders
may reach us. But though old age may compel a horse to remain away from the race, it may
often happen that the din of the trampling racers rouses him into excitement, that he lifts
his head with eager looks, that he shows his spirit in his breathings, and prances and paws
the ground frequently, though this eagerness is all that is left to him, and time has sapped
his powers of going. In the same way our pen remains outside the combat, and age compels
it to yield the course to the professors who flourish now; nevertheless its eagerness to join
the contest about you survives, and that it can still evince, even though these stylists who
flourish now are at the height of their powers1531. But none of this display of my enthusiasm
for you has anything to do with sounding your own praises: no style, however nervous and
well-balanced, would easily succeed there; so that any one, who attempted to describe that
embarrassing yet harmonious mixture of opposites in your character, would inevitably be
left far behind your real worth. Nature, indeed, by throwing out the shade of the eyelashes
before the glaring rays, brings to the eyes themselves a weaker light, and so the sunlight becomes
tolerable to us, mingling as it does, in quantities proportionate to our need, with the
shadows which the lashes cast. Just so the grandeur and the greatness of your character,
tempered by your modesty and humbleness of mind, instead of blinding the beholder’s eye,
makes the sight on the contrary a pleasurable one; wherein this humbleness of mind does
not occasion the splendour of the greatness to be dimmed, and its latent force to be overlooked;
but the one is to be noticed in the other, the humility of your character in its elevation,
and the grandeur reversely in the lowliness. Others must describe all this; and extol, besides,
the many-sightedness of your mind. Your intellectual eyes are indeed as numerous, it may
perhaps be said, as the hairs of the head; their keen unerring gaze is on everything alike; the

with the same energy and with the amount of attention that is required. Another, too, must
record his admiration of the way in which poverty is made rich by you; if indeed any one
is to be found in this age of ours who will make that a subject of praise and wonder. Yet
surely now, if never before, the love of poverty will through you abound, and your ingotten
wealth1532 will be envied above the ingots of Croesus. For whom has sea and land, with all
the dower of their natural produce, enriched, as thy rejection of worldly abundance has
enriched thee? They wipe the stain from steel and so make it shine like silver: so has the
gleam of thy life grown brighter, ever carefully cleansed from the rust of wealth. We leave
that to those who can enlarge upon it, and also upon your excellent knowledge of the things
in which it is more glorious to gain than to abstain from gain. Grant me, however, leave to
say, that you do not despise all acquisitions; that there are some which, though none of your
predecessors has been able to clutch, yet you and you alone have seized with both your
hands; for, instead of dresses and slaves and money, you have and hold the very souls of
men, and store them in the treasure-house of your love. The essayists and pamphleteers,
whose glory comes from such laudations, will go into these matters. But our pen, veteran
as it now is, is to rouse itself only so far as to go at a foot’s pace through the problem which
your wisdom has proposed; namely, this—what we are to think of those who are taken
prematurely, the moment of whose birth almost coincides with that of their death. The
cultured heathen Plato spoke, in the person of one who had come to life again1533, much
philosophy about the judgment courts in that other world; but he has left this other question
a mystery, as ostensibly too great for human conjecture to be employed upon. If, then, there
is anything in these lucubrations of ours that is of a nature to clear up the obscurities of this
question, you will doubtless welcome the new account of it; if otherwise, you will at all events
excuse this in old age, and accept, if nothing else, our wish to afford you some degree of
pleasure. History1534 says that Xerxes, that great prince who had made almost every land
under the sun into one vast camp, and roused with his own designs the whole world, when
he was marching against the Greeks received with delight a poor man’s gift; and that gift
was water, and that not in a jar, but carried in the hollow of the palm of his hand. So do you,

of your innate generosity, follow his example; to him the will made the gift, and our gift
may be found in itself but a poor watery thing. In the case of the wonders in the heavens, a
man sees their beauty equally, whether he is trained to watch them, or whether he gazes
upwards with an unscientific eye; but the feeling towards them is not the same in the man
who comes from philosophy to their contemplation, and in him who has only his senses of
perception to commit them to; the latter may be pleased with the sunlight, or deem the
beauty of stars worthy of his wonder, or have watched the stages of the moon’s course
throughout the month; but the former, who has the soul-insight, and whose training has
enlightened him so as to comprehend the phenomena of the heavens, leaves unnoticed all
these things which delight the senses of the more unthinking, and looks at the harmony of
the whole, inspecting the concert which results even from opposite movements in the circular
revolutions; how the inner circles of these turn the contrary way to that in which the fixed
stars are carried round1535; how those of the heavenly bodies to be observed in these inner
circles are variously grouped in their approachments and divergements, their disappearances
behind each other and their flank movements, and yet effect always precisely in the same
way that notable and never-ending harmony; of which those are conscious who do not
overlook the position of the tiniest star, and whose minds, by training domiciled above, pay
equal attention to them all. In the same way do you, a precious life to me, watch the Divine
economy; leaving those objects which unceasingly occupy the minds of the crowd, wealth,
I mean, and luxury1536 and vainglory—things which like sunbeams flashing in their faces
dazzle the unthinking—you will not pass without inquiry the seemingly most trivial questions
in the world; for you do most carefully scrutinize the inequalities in human lives; not only
with regard to wealth and penury, and the differences of position and descent (for you know
that they are as nothing, and that they owe their existence not to any intrinsic reality, but
to the foolish estimate of those who are struck with nonentities, as if they were actual things;
and that if one were only to abstract from somebody who glitters with glory the blind adoration1537
of those who gaze at him, nothing would be left him after all the inflated pride
which elates him, even though the whole mass of the world’s riches were buried in his cellars),
but it is one of your anxieties to know, amongst the other intentions of each detail of the
Divine government, wherefore it is that, while the life of one is lengthened into old age,
another has only so far a portion of it as to breathe the air with one gasp, and die. If nothing

in this world happens without God, but all is linked to the Divine will, and if the Deity is
skilful and prudential, then it follows necessarily that there is some plan in these things
bearing the mark of His wisdom, and at the same time of His providential care. A blind
unmeaning occurrence can never be the work of God; for it is the property of God, as the
Scripture says1538, to “make all things in wisdom.” What wisdom, then, can we trace in the
following? A human being enters on the scene of life, draws in the air, beginning the process
of living with a cry of pain, pays the tribute of a tear to Nature1539, just tastes life’s sorrows,
before any of its sweets have been his, before his feelings have gained any strength; still loose
in all his joints, tender, pulpy, unset; in a word, before he is even human (if the gift of reason
is man’s peculiarity, and he has never had it in him), such an one, with no advantage over
the embryo in the womb except that he has seen the air, so short-lived, dies and goes to
pieces again; being either exposed or suffocated, or else of his own accord ceasing to live
from weakness. What are we to think about him? How are we to feel about such deaths?
Will a soul such as that behold its Judge? Will it stand with the rest before the tribunal? Will
it undergo its trial for deeds done in life? Will it receive the just recompense by being purged,
according to the Gospel utterances, in fire, or refreshed with the dew of blessing1540? But I
do not see how we can imagine that, in the case of such a soul. The word “retribution” implies
that something must have been previously given; but he who has not lived at all has been
deprived of the material from which to give anything. There being, then, no retribution,

<note type="footnote">1539 ἐλειτούργησε τὸ δάκρυον</note>
<note type="footnote">1540 There is introduced at these words in the text of the Paris Edition the following “Explicatio,” in Greek.
“Here it is manifest that the father means by the ‘purging fire’ the torments and agonies suffered by those who
having sinned have not completed a worthy and adequate repentance, according to the Gospel parable of the
Rich Man and Lazarus. For it is clear that he is thinking of this parable when he says, ‘either purged in fire’ (i.e.
the Rich Man), ‘or refreshed with the dew of blessing’ (i.e. Lazarus). But that sentence of the Judgment, ‘They
shall go, these into everlasting punishment, but the just into life everlasting,’ has no place as yet in these sufferings.”
In other words, the commentator sees here the doctrine of Purgatory, as held by the Roman Church. And when
we compare the other passages in Gregory about the “cleansing fire,” especially that De Animâ et Resurrectione,
247 B, we shall see that he contemplates the judgment (“the incorruptible tribunal”) as coming not only after
the Resurrection, but also after the chastising process. Not till the Judgment will the moral value of each life be
revealed; the chastising is a purely natural process. But then the belief in a Judgment coming after everything
rather contradicts the Universalism with which he has been charged, for what necessity would there be for it, if
the chastising was successful in every instance? With regard to the nature of this “fire,” it is spiritual or material
with him according to the context. The invisible natures will be punished with the one, the visible (i.e. the World)
with the other: although this destruction is not always preserved by him. See E. Moeller (on Gregory’s Doctrine
on Human Nature), p. 100.</note>

there is neither good nor evil left to expect. “Retribution” purports to be the paying back of
one of these two qualities; but that which is to be found neither in the category of good nor
that of bad is in no category at all; for this antithesis between good and bad is an opposition
that admits no middle; and neither will come to him who has not made a beginning with
either of them. What therefore falls under neither of these heads may be said not even to
have existed. But if some one says that such a life does not only exist, but exists as one of
the good ones, and that God gives, though He does not repay, what is good to such, we may
ask what sort of reason he advances for this partiality; how is justice apparent in such a view;
how will he prove his idea in concordance with the utterances in the Gospels? There (the
Master) says, the acquisition of the Kingdom comes to those who are deemed worthy of it,
as a matter of exchange. “When ye have done such and such things, then it is right that ye
get the Kingdom as a reward.” But in this case there is no act of doing or of willing beforehand,
and so what occasion is there for saying that these will receive from God any expected
recompense? If one unreservedly accepts a statement such as that, to the effect that any so
passing into life will necessarily be classed amongst the good, it will dawn upon him then
that not partaking in life at all will be a happier state than living, seeing that in the one case
the enjoyment of good is placed beyond a doubt even with barbarian parentage, or a conception
from a union not legitimate; but he who has lived the span ordinarily possible to
Nature gets the pollution of evil necessarily mingled more or less with his life, or, if he is to
be quite outside this contagion, it will be at the price of much painful effort. For virtue is
achieved by its seekers not without a struggle; nor is abstinence from the paths of pleasure
a painless process to human nature. So that one of two probations must be the inevitable
fate of him who has had the longer lease of life; either to combat here on Virtue’s toilsome
field, or to suffer there the painful recompense of a life of evil. But in the case of infants
prematurely dying there is nothing of that sort; but they pass to the blessed lot at once, if
those who take this view of the matter speak true. It follows also necessarily from this that
a state of unreason is preferable to having reason, and virtue will thereby be revealed as of
no value: if he who has never possessed it suffers no loss, so, as regards the enjoyment of
blessedness, the labour to acquire it will be useless folly; the unthinking condition will be
the one that comes out best from God’s judgment. For these and such-like reasons you bid
me sift the matter, with a view to our getting, by dint of a closely-reasoned inquiry, some
firm ground on which to rest our thoughts about it.</p>
<p>For my part, in view of the difficulties of the subject proposed, I think the exclamation
of the Apostle very suitable to the present case, just as he uttered it over unfathomable
questions: “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind
of the Lord1541?” But seeing on the other hand that that Apostle declares it to be a peculiarity

<pb n="697"/>
of him that is spiritual to “judge all things1542,” and commends those who have been “enriched1543”
by the Divine grace “in all utterance and in all knowledge,” I venture to assert
that it is not right to omit the examination which is within the range of our ability, nor to
leave the question here raised without making any inquiries, or having any ideas about it;
lest, like the actual subject of our proposed discussion, this essay should have an ineffectual
ending, spoilt before its maturity by the fatal indolence of those who will not nerve themselves
to search out the truth, like a new-born infant ere it sees the light and acquires any strength.
I assert, too, that it is not well at once to confront and meet objections, as if we were pleading
in court, but to introduce a certain order into the discussion and to lead the view on from
one point to another. What, then, should this order be? First, we want to know the whence
of human nature, and the wherefore of its ever having come into existence. If we hit the
answer to these questions, we shall not fail in getting the required explanation. Now, that
everything that exists, after God, in the intellectual or sensible world of beings owes that
existence to Him, is a proposition which it is superfluous to prove; no one, with however
little insight into the truth of things, would gainsay it. For every one agrees that the Universe
is linked to one First Cause; that nothing in it owes its existence to itself, so as to be its own
origin and cause; but that there is on the other hand a single uncreate eternal Essence, the
same for ever, which transcends all our ideas of distance, conceived of as without increase
or decrease, and beyond the scope of any definition; and that time and space with all their
consequences, and anything previous to these that thought can grasp in the intelligible
supramundane world, are all the productions of this Essence. Well, then, we affirm that
human nature is one of these productions; and a word of the inspired Teaching helps us in
this, which declares that when God had brought all things else upon the scene of life, man
was exhibited upon the earth, a mixture from Divine sources, the godlike intellectual essence
being in him united with the several portions of earthly elements contributed towards his
formation, and that he was fashioned by his Maker to be the incarnate likeness of Divine
transcendent Power. It would be better however to quote the very words: “And God created
man, in the image of God created He him1544.” Now the reason of the making of this animate
being has been given by certain writers previous to us as follows. The whole creation is divided
into two parts; that “which is seen,” and that “which is not seen,” to use the Apostle’s words
(the second meaning the intelligible and immaterial, the first, the sensible and material);
and being thus divided, the angelic and spiritual natures, which are among “the things not
seen,” reside in places above the world, and above the heavens, because such a residence is
in correspondence with their constitution; for an intellectual nature is a fine, clear, unen-

<pb n="698"/>
cumbered, agile kind of thing, and a heavenly body is fine and light, and perpetually moving,
and the earth on the contrary, which stands last in the list of things sensible, can never be
an adequate and congenial spot for creatures intellectual to sojourn in. For what correspondence
can there possibly be between that which is light and buoyant, on the one hand, and
that which is heavy and gravitating on the other? Well, in order that the earth may not be
completely devoid of the local indwelling of the intellectual and the immaterial, man (these
writers tell us) was fashioned by the Supreme forethought, and his earthy parts moulded
over the intellectual and godlike essence of his soul; and so this amalgamation with that
which has material weight enables the soul to live on this element of earth, which possesses
a certain bond of kindred with the substance of the flesh. The design of all that is being
born1545, then, is that the Power which is above both the heavenly and the earthly universe
may in all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures, conspiring to
the same end by virtue of the same faculty in operation in all, I mean that of looking upon
God. But this operation of looking upon God is nothing less than the life-nourishment appropriate,
as like to like, to an intellectual nature. For just as these bodies, earthy as they are,
are preserved by nourishment that is earthy, and we detect in them all alike, whether brute
or reasoning, the operations of a material kind of vitality, so it is right to assume that there
is an intellectual life-nourishment as well, by which such natures1546 are maintained in existence.
But if bodily food, coming and going as it does in circulation, nevertheless imparts
a certain amount of vital energy to those who get it, how much more does the partaking of
the real thing, always remaining and always the same, preserve the eater in existence? If,
then, this is the life-nourishment of an intellectual nature, namely, to have a part in God,
this part will not be gained by that which is of an opposite quality; the would-be partaker
must in some degree be akin to that which is to be partaken of. The eye enjoys the light by
virtue of having light within itself to seize its kindred light, and the finger or any other limb
cannot effect the act of vision because none of this natural light is organized in any of them.
The same necessity requires that in our partaking of God there should be some kinship in
the constitution of the partaker with that which is partaken of. Therefore, as the Scripture
says, man was made in the image of God; that like, I take it, might be able to see like; and
to see God is, as was said above, the life of the soul. But seeing that ignorance of the true
good is like a mist that obscures the visual keenness of the soul, and that when that mist
grows denser a cloud is formed so thick that Truth’s ray cannot pierce through these depths
of ignorance, it follows further that with the total deprivation of the light the soul’s life ceases

altogether; for we have said that the real life of the soul is acted out in partaking of the Good;
but when ignorance hinders this apprehension of God, the soul which thus ceases to partake
of God, ceases also to live. But no one can force us to give the family history1547 of this ignorance,
asking whence and from what father it is; let him be given to understand from the
word itself that “ignorance” and “knowledge” indicate one of the relations of the soul;1548
but no relation, whether expressed or not, conveys the idea of substance; a relation and a
substance are quite of different descriptions. If, then, knowledge is not a substance, but a
perfected1549 operation of the soul, it must be conceded that ignorance must be much farther
removed still from anything in the way of substance; but that which is not in that way does
not exist at all; and so it would be useless to trouble ourselves about where it comes from.
Now seeing that the Word1550 declares that the living in God is the life of the soul, and
seeing that this living is knowledge according to each man’s ability, and that ignorance does
not imply the reality of anything, but is only the negation of the operation of knowing, and
seeing that upon this partaking in God being no longer effected there follows at once the
cancelling of the soul’s life, which is the worst of evils,—because of all this the Producer of
all Good would work in us the cure of such an evil. A cure is a good thing, but one who does
not look to the evangelic mystery would still be ignorant of the manner of the cure. We have
shown that alienation from God, Who is the Life, is an evil; the cure, then, of this infirmity
is, again to be made friends with God, and so to be in life once more. When such a life, then,
is always held up in hope before humanity, it cannot be said that the winning of this life is
absolutely a reward of a good life, and that the contrary is a punishment (of a bad one); but
what we insist on resembles the case of the eyes. We do not say that one who has clear eyesight
is rewarded as with a prize by being able to perceive the objects of sight; nor on the other
hand that he who has diseased eyes experiences a failure of optic activity as the result of
some penal sentence. With the eye in a natural state sight follows necessarily; with it vitiated
by disease failure of sight as necessarily follows. In the same way the life of blessedness is as
a familiar second nature to those who have kept clear the senses of the soul; but when the
blinding stream of ignorance prevents our partaking in the real light, then it necessarily
follows that we miss that, the enjoyment of which we declare to be the life of the partaker.</p>
<p>Now that we have laid down these premisses, it is time to examine in the light of them
the question proposed to us. It was somewhat of this kind. “If the recompense of blessedness
is assigned according to the principles of justice, in what class shall he be placed who has
died in infancy without having laid in this life any foundation, good or bad, whereby any

return according to his deserts may be given him?” To this we shall make answer, with our
eye fixed upon the consequences of that which we have already laid down, that this happiness
in the future, while it is in its essence a heritage of humanity, may at the same time be called
in one sense a recompense; and we will make clear our meaning by the same instance as
before. Let us suppose two persons suffering from an affection of the eyes; and that the one
surrenders himself most diligently to the process of being cured, and undergoes all that
Medicine can apply to him, however painful it may be; and that the other indulges without
restraint in baths1551 and wine-drinking, and listens to no advice whatever of his doctor as
to the healing of his eyes. Well, when we look to the end of each of these we say that each
duly receives in requital the fruits of his choice, the one in deprivation of the light, the other
in its enjoyment; by a misuse of the word we do actually call that which necessarily follows,
a recompense. We may speak, then, in this way also as regards this question of the infants:
we may say that the enjoyment of that future life does indeed belong of right to the human
being, but that, seeing the plague of ignorance has seized almost all now living in the flesh,
he who has purged himself of it by means of the necessary courses of treatment receives the
due reward of his diligence, when he enters on the life that is truly natural; while he who
refuses Virtue’s purgatives and renders that plague of ignorance, through the pleasures he
has been entrapped by, difficult in his case to cure, gets himself into an unnatural state, and
so is estranged from the truly natural life, and has no share in the existence which of right
belongs to us and is congenial to us. Whereas the innocent babe has no such plague before
its soul’s eyes obscuring1552 its measure of light, and so it continues to exist in that natural
life; it does not need the soundness which comes from purgation, because it never admitted
the plague into its soul at all. Further, the present life appears to me to offer a sort of analogy
to the future life we hope for, and to be intimately connected with it, thus; the tenderest infancy
is suckled and reared with milk from the breast; then another sort of food appropriate
to the subject of this fostering, and intimately adapted to his needs, succeeds, until at last
he arrives at full growth. And so I think, in quantities continually adapted to it, in a sort of
regular progress, the soul partakes of that truly natural life; according to its capacity and its
power it receives a measure of the delights of the Blessed state; indeed we learn as much
from Paul, who had a different sort of food for him who was already grown in virtue and
for the imperfect “babe.” For to the last he says, “I have fed you with milk, and not with
meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it1553.” But to those who have grown to the full
measure of intellectual maturity he says, “But strong meat belongeth to those that are of full
age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised<gap reason=" omitted"/>1554” Now it is not right

to say that the man and the infant are in a similar state however free both may be from any
contact of disease (for how can those who do not partake of exactly the same things be in
an equal state of enjoyment?); on the contrary, though the absence of any affliction from
disease may be predicated of both alike as long as both are out of the reach of its influence,
yet, when we come to the matter of delights, there is no likeness in the enjoyment, though
the percipients are in the same condition. For the man there is a natural delight in discussions,
and in the management of affairs, and in the honourable discharge of the duties of an office,
and in being distinguished for acts of help to the needy; in living, it may be, with a wife
whom he loves, and ruling his household; and in all those amusements to be found in this
life in the way of pastime, in musical pieces and theatrical spectacles, in the chase, in bathing,
in gymnastics, in the mirth of banquets, and anything else of that sort. For the infant, on
the contrary, there is a natural delight in its milk, and in its nurse’s arms, and in gentle
rocking that induces and then sweetens its slumber. Any happiness beyond this the tenderness
of its years naturally prevents it from feeling. In the same manner those who in their life
here have nourished the forces of their souls by a course of virtue, and have, to use the
Apostle’s words, had the “senses” of their minds “exercised,” will, if they are translated to
that life beyond, which is out of the body, proportionately to the condition and the powers
they have attained participate in that divine delight; they will have more or they will have
less of its riches according to the capacity acquired. But the soul that has never felt the taste
of virtue, while it may indeed remain perfectly free from the sufferings which flow from
wickedness having never caught the disease of evil at all, does nevertheless in the first instance1555
partake only so far in that life beyond (which consists, according to our previous
definition, in the knowing and being in God) as this nursling can receive; until the time
comes that it has thriven on the contemplation of the truly Existent as on a congenial diet,
and, becoming capable of receiving more, takes at will more from that abundant supply of
the truly Existent which is offered.</p>
<p>Having, then, all these considerations in our view, we hold that the soul of him who has
reached every virtue in his course, and the soul of him whose portion of life has been simply
nothing, are equally out of the reach of those sufferings which flow from wickedness. Nevertheless
we do not conceive of the employment of their lives as on the same level at all. The
one has heard those heavenly announcements, by which, in the words of the Prophet, “the
glory of God is declared1556,” and, travelling through creation, has been led to the apprehension
of a Master of the creation; he has taken the true Wisdom for his teacher, that Wisdom
which the spectacle of the Universe suggests; and when he observed the beauty of this ma-

terial sunlight he had grasped by analogy the beauty of the real sunlight1557; he saw in the
solid firmness of this earth the unchangeableness of its Creator; when he perceived the immensity
of the heavens he was led on the road towards the vast Infinity of that Power which
encompasses the Universe; when he saw the rays of the sun reaching from such sublimities
even to ourselves he began to believe, by the means of such phenomena, that the activities
of the Divine Intelligence did not fail to descend from the heights of Deity even to each one
of us; for if a single luminary can occupy everything alike that lies beneath it with the force
of light, and, more than that, can, while lending itself to all who can use it, still remain selfcentred
and undissipated, how much more shall the Creator of that luminary become “all
in all,” as the Apostle speaks, and come into each with such a measure of Himself as each
subject of His influence can receive! Nay, look only at an ear of corn, at the germinating of
some plant, at a ripe bunch of grapes, at the beauty of early autumn, whether in fruit or
flower, at the grass springing unbidden, at the mountain reaching up with its summit to the
height of the ether, at the springs on its slopes bursting from those swelling breasts, and
running in rivers through the glens, at the sea receiving those streams from every direction
and yet remaining within its limits, with waves edged by the stretches of beach and never
stepping beyond those fixed boundaries of continent: look at these and such-like sights, and
how can the eye of reason fail to find in them all that our education for Realities requires?

<note type="footnote">1557 This mysticism of Gregory is an extension of Origen’s view that there are direct affinities or analogies
between the visible and invisible world. Gregory here and elsewhere proposes to find in the facts of nature
nothing less than analogies with the energies, and so with the essence, of the Deity. The marks stamped upon
the Creation translate these energies into language intelligible to us: just as the energies in their turn translate
the essence, as he insists on in his treatise against Eunomius. This world, in effect, exists only in order to manifest
the Divine Being. But the human soul, of all that is created, is the special field where analogies to the Creator
are to be sought, because we feel both by their energies alone; both the soul and God are hid from us, in their
essence. “Since,” he says (De Hom Opif. c. xi.) “one of the attributes we contemplate in the Divine nature is incomprehensibility
of essence, it is clearly necessary that in this point ‘the image’ should be able to show its resemblance
to the Archetype. For if, while the Archetype transcends comprehension, the essence of ‘the image’
were comprehended, the contrary character of the attributes we behold in them would prove the defect of ‘the
image’; but since the essence of our Mind eludes our knowledge, it has an exact resemblance to the Supreme
essence, figuring as it does by its own unknowableness the incomprehensible Being.” Therefore, Gregory goes
to the interior facts of our nature for the actual proof of theological doctrine. God is “spirit” because of the
spirituality of the soul. The “generation” of the Son is proved by the Will emanating from the Reason. Gregory
follows this line even more resolutely than Origen. He was the first Father who sought to explain the Trinity by
the triple divisions of the soul which Platonism offered. Cf. his treatise De eo quod sit ad immutabilitatem, U+0026c.,

enjoyment of those delights beyond? Not to speak of the studies which sharpen the mind
towards moral excellence, geometry, I mean, and astronomy, and the knowledge of the truth
that the science of numbers gives, and every method that furnishes a proof of the unknown
and a conviction of the known, and, before all these, the philosophy contained in the inspired
Writings, which affords a complete purification to those who educate themselves thereby
in the mysteries of God. But the man who has acquired the knowledge of none of these
things and has not even been conducted by the material cosmos to the perception of the
beauties above it, and passes through life with his mind in a kind of tender, unformed, and
untrained state, he is not the man that is likely to be placed amongst the same surroundings
as our argument has indicated that other man, before spoken of, to be placed; so that, in
this view, it can no longer be maintained that, in the two supposed and completely opposite
cases, the one who has taken no part in life is more blessed than the one who has taken a
noble part in it. Certainly, in comparison with one who has lived all his life in sin, not only
the innocent babe but even one who has never come into the world at all will be blessed.
We learn as much too in the case of Judas, from the sentence pronounced upon him in the
Gospels1558; namely, that when we think of such men, that which never existed is to be
preferred to that which has existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth
of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity1559;
but as for what has never existed, how can any torment touch it?—However, notwithstanding
that, the man who institutes a comparison between the infantine immature
life and that of perfect virtue, must himself be pronounced immature for so judging of
realities. Do you, then, in consequence of this, ask the reason why so and so, quite tender
in age, is quietly taken away from amongst the living? Do you ask what the Divine wisdom
contemplates in this? Well, if you are thinking of all those infants who are proofs of illicit
connections, and so are made away with by their parents, you are not justified in calling to
account, for such wickedness, that God Who will surely bring to judgment the unholy deeds
done in this way. In the case, on the other hand, of any infant who, though his parents have
nurtured him, and have with nursing and supplication spent earnest care upon him, nevertheless
does not continue in this world, but succumbs to a sickness even unto death, which
is unmistakably the sole cause of it, we venture upon the following considerations. It is a
sign of the perfection of God’s providence, that He not only heals maladies1560 that have
come into existence, but also provides that some should be never mixed up at all in the

things which He has forbidden; it is reasonable, that is, to expect that He Who knows the
future equally with the past should check the advance of an infant to complete maturity, in
order that the evil may not be developed which His foreknowledge has detected in his future
life, and in order that a lifetime granted to one whose evil dispositions will be lifelong may
not become the actual material for his vice. We shall better explain what we are thinking of
by an illustration.</p>
<p>Suppose a banquet of very varied abundance, prepared for a certain number of guests,
and let the chair be taken by one of their number who is gifted to know accurately the peculiarities
of constitution in each of them, and what food is best adapted to each temperament,
what is harmful and unsuitable; in addition to this let him be entrusted with a sort of absolute
authority over them, whether to allow as he pleases so and so to remain at the board or to
expel so and so, and to take every precaution that each should address himself to the viands
most suited to his constitution, so that the invalid should not kill himself by adding the fuel
of what he was eating to his ailment, while the guest in robuster health should not make
himself ill with things not good for him1561 and fall into discomfort from over-feeding1562.
Suppose, amongst these, one of those inclined to drink is conducted out in the middle of
the banquet or even at the very beginning of it; or let him remain to the very end, it all depending
on the way that the president can secure that perfect order shall prevail, if possible,
at the board throughout, and that the evil sights of surfeiting, tippling, and tipsiness shall
be absent. It is just so, then, as when that individual is not very pleased at being torn away
from all the savoury dainties and deprived of his favourite liquors, but is inclined to charge
the president with want of justice and judgment, as having turned him away from the feast
for envy, and not for any forethought for him; but if he were to catch a sight of those who
were already beginning to misbehave themselves, from the long continuance of their
drinking, in the way of vomitings and putting their heads on the table and unseemly talk,
he would perhaps feel grateful to him for having removed him, before he got into such a
condition, from a deep debauch. If our illustration1563 is understood, we can easily apply
the rule which it contains to the question before us. What, then, was that question? Why
does God, when fathers endeavour their utmost to preserve a successor to their line, often
let the son and heir be snatched away in earliest infancy1564? To those who ask this, we shall
reply with the illustration of the banquet; namely, that Life’s board is as it were crowded
with a vast abundance and variety of dainties; and it must, please, be noticed that, true to
the practice of gastronomy, all its dishes are not sweetened with the honey of enjoyment,

but in some cases an existence has a taste of some especially harsh mischances1565 given to
it: just as experts in the arts of catering desire how they may excite the appetites of the guests
with sharp, or briny, or astringent dishes. Life, I say, is not in all its circumstances as sweet
as honey; there are circumstances in it in which mere brine is the only relish, or into which
an astringent, or vinegary, or sharp pungent flavour has so insinuated itself, that the rich
sauce becomes very difficult to taste: the cups of Temptation, too, are filled with all sorts of
beverages; some by the error of pride1566 produce the vice of inflated vanity; others lure on
those who drain them to some deed of rashness; whilst in other cases they excite a vomiting
in which all the ill-gotten acquisitions of years are with shame surrendered1567. Therefore,
to prevent one who has indulged in the carousals to an improper extent from lingering over
so profusely furnished a table, he is early taken from the number of the banqueters, and
thereby secures an escape out of those evils which unmeasured indulgence procures for
gluttons. This is that achievement of a perfect Providence which I spoke of; namely, not
only to heal evils that have been committed, but also to forestall them before they have been
committed; and this, we suspect, is the cause of the deaths of new-born infants. He Who
does all things upon a Plan withdraws the materials for evil in His love to the individual,
and, to a character whose marks His Foreknowledge has read, grants no time to display by
a pre-eminence in actual vice what it is when its propensity to evil gets free play. Often, too,
the Arranger of this Feast of Life exposes by such-like dispensations the cunning device of
the “constraining cause” of money-loving1568, so that this vice comes to the light bared of
all specious pretexts, and no longer obscured by any misleading screen1569. For most declare
that they give play1570 to their cravings for more, in order that they may make their offspring
all the richer; but that their vice belongs to their nature, and is not caused by any external
necessity, is proved by that inexcusable avarice which is observed in childless persons. Many
who have no heir, nor any hope of one, for the great wealth which they have laboriously
gained, rear a countless brood within themselves of wants instead of children, and they are
left without a channel into which to convey this incurable disease, though they cannot find
an excuse in any necessity for this failing1571. But take the case of some who, during their

sojourn in life, have been fierce and domineering in disposition, slaves to every kind of lust,
passionate to madness, refraining from no act even of the most desperate wickedness, robbers
and murderers, traitors to their country, and, more execrable still, patricides, mother-killers,
child-murderers, mad after unnatural intercourse; suppose such characters grow old in this
wickedness; how, some one may ask, does this harmonize with the result of our previous
investigations? If that which is taken away before its time in order that it may not continuously
glut itself, according to our illustration of the banquet, with Life’s indulgences, is
providentially removed from that carouse, what is the special design in so and so, who is of
that disposition, being allowed to continue his revels1572 to old age, steeping both himself
and his boon companions in the noxious fumes of his debauchery? In fine, you will ask,
wherefore does God in His Providence withdraw one from life before his character can be
perfected in evil, and leave another to grow to be such a monster that it had been better for
him if he had never been born? In answer to this we will give, to those who are inclined to
receive it favourably, a reason such as follows: viz. that oftentimes the existence of those
whose life has been a good one operates to the advantage of their offspring; and there are
hundreds of passages testifying to this in the inspired Writings, which clearly teach us that
the tender care shown by God to those who have deserved it is shared in by their successors,
and that even to have been an obstruction, in the path to wickedness, to any one who is sure
to live wickedly, is a good result1573. But seeing that our Reason in this matter has to grope
in the dark, clearly no one can complain if its conjecturing leads our mind to a variety of
conclusions. Well, then, not only one might pronounce that God, in kindness to the Founders
of some Family, withdraws a member of it who is going to live a bad life from that bad life,
but, even if there is no antecedent such as this in the case of some early deaths, it is not unreasonable
to conjecture that they would have plunged into a vicious life with a more desperate
vehemence than any of those who have actually become notorious for their wickedness.</p>
<p>That nothing happens without God we know from many sources; and, reversely, that
God’s dispensations have no element of chance and confusion in them every one will allow,
who realizes that God is Reason, and Wisdom, and Perfect Goodness, and Truth, and could
not admit of that which is not good and not consistent with His Truth1574. Whether, then,
the early deaths of infants are to be attributed to the aforesaid causes, or whether there is
some further cause of them beyond these, it befits us to acknowledge that these things happen
for the best. I have another reason also to give which I have learnt from the wisdom of an
Apostle; a reason, that is, why some of those who have been distinguished for their

wickedness have been suffered to live on in their self-chosen course. Having expanded a
thought of this kind at some length in his argument to the Romans1575, and having retorted
upon himself with the counter-conclusion, which thence necessarily follows, that the sinner
could no longer be justly blamed, if his sinning is a dispensation of God, and that he would
not have existed at all, if it had been contrary to the wishes of Him Who has the world in
His power, the Apostle meets this conclusion and solves this counter-plea by means of a
still deeper view of things. He tells us that God, in rendering to every one his due, sometimes
even grants a scope to wickedness for good in the end. Therefore He allowed the King of
Egypt, for example, to be born and to grow up such as he was; the intention was that Israel,
that great nation exceeding all calculation by numbers, might be instructed by his disaster.
God’s omnipotence is to be recognized in every direction; it has strength to bless the deserving;
it is not inadequate to the punishment of wickedness1576; and so, as the complete
removal of that peculiar people out of Egypt was necessary in order to prevent their receiving
any infection from the sins of Egypt in a misguided way of living, therefore that God-defying
and infamous Pharaoh rose and reached his maturity in the lifetime of the very people who
were to be benefited, so that Israel might acquire a just knowledge of the two-fold energy
of God, working as it did in either direction; the more beneficent they learnt in their own
persons, the sterner by seeing it exercised upon those who were being scourged for their
wickedness; for in His consummate wisdom God can mould even evil into co-operation
with good. The artisan (if the Apostle’s argument may be confirmed by any words of
ours)—the artisan who by his skill has to fashion iron to some instrument for daily use, has
need not only of that which owing to its natural ductility lends itself to his art, but, be the
iron never so hard, be it never so difficult to soften it in the fire, be it even impossible owing
to its adamantine resistance to mould it into any useful implement, his art requires the co-
operation even of this; he will use it for an anvil, upon which the soft workable iron may be
beaten and formed into something useful. But some one will say, “It is not all who thus reap
in this life the fruits of their wickedness, any more than all those whose lives have been virtuous
profit while living by their virtuous endeavours; what then, I ask, is the advantage of
their existence in the case of these who live to the end unpunished?” I will bring forward to
meet this question of yours a reason which transcends all human arguments. Somewhere
in his utterances the great David declares that some portion of the blessedness of the virtuous
will consist in this; in contemplating side by side with their own felicity the perdition of the
reprobate. He says, “The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash
his hands in the blood of the ungodly1577”; not indeed as rejoicing over the torments of

<pb n="708"/>
those sufferers, but as then most completely realizing the extent of the well-earned rewards
of virtue. He signifies by those words that it will be an addition to the felicity of the virtuous
and an intensification of it, to have its contrary set against it. In saying that “he washes his
hands in the blood of the ungodly” he would convey the thought that “the cleanness of his
own acting in life is plainly declared in the perdition of the ungodly.” For the expression
“wash” represents the idea of cleanness; but no one is washed, but is rather defiled, in blood;
whereby it is clear that it is a comparison with the harsher forms of punishment that puts
in a clearer light the blessedness of virtue. We must now summarize our argument, in order
that the thoughts which we have expanded may be more easily retained in the memory. The
premature deaths of infants have nothing in them to suggest the thought that one who so
terminates his life is subject to some grievous misfortune, any more than they are to be put
on a level with the deaths of those who have purified themselves in this life by every kind
of virtue; the more far-seeing Providence of God curtails the immensity of sins in the case
of those whose lives are going to be so evil. That some of the wicked have lived on1578 does
not upset this reason which we have rendered; for the evil was in their case hindered in
kindness to their parents; whereas, in the case of those whose parents have never imparted
to them any power of calling upon God, such a form of the Divine kindness1579, which accompanies
such a power, is not transmitted to their own children; otherwise the infant now
prevented by death from growing up wicked would have exhibited a far more desperate
wickedness than the most notorious sinners, seeing that it would have been unhindered.
Even granting that some have climbed to the topmost pinnacle of crime, the Apostolic view
supplies a comforting answer to the question; for He Who does everything with Wisdom
knows how to effect by means of evil some good. Still further, if some occupy a pre-eminence
in crime, and yet for all that have never been a metal, to use our former illustration, that
God’s skill has used for any good, this is a case which constitutes an addition to the happiness
of the good, as the Prophet’s words suggest; it may be reckoned as not a slight element in
that happiness, nor, on the other hand, as one unworthy of God’s providing.</p>

<head>On Pilgrimages.1580</head>
<p>Since, my friend, you ask me a question in your letter, I think that it is incumbent upon
me to answer you in their proper order upon all the points connected with it. It is, then, my
opinion that it is a good thing for those who have dedicated themselves once for all to the
higher life to fix their attention continually upon the utterances in the Gospel, and, just as
those who correct their work in any given material by a rule, and by means of the straightness
of that rule bring the crookedness which their hands detect to straightness, so it is right that
we should apply to these questions a strict and flawless measure as it were,—I mean, of
course, the Gospel rule of life1581,—and in accordance with that, direct ourselves in the
sight of God. Now there are some amongst those who have entered upon the monastic and
hermit life, who have made it a part of their devotion to behold those spots at Jerusalem
where the memorials of our Lord’s life in the flesh are on view; it would be well, then, to
look to this Rule, and if the finger of its precepts points to the observance of such things, to
perform the work, as the actual injunction of our Lord; but if they lie quite outside the
commandment of the Master, I do not see what there is to command any one who has become
a law of duty to himself to be zealous in performing any of them. When the Lord invites the
blest to their inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, He does not include a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem amongst their good deeds; when He announces the Beatitudes, He does not name
amongst them that sort of devotion. But as to that which neither makes us blessed nor sets
us in the path to the kingdom, for what reason it should be run after, let him that is wise
consider. Even if there were some profit in what they do, yet even so, those who are perfect
<note type="footnote">1580 The modern history of this Letter is curious. Its genuineness though suspected by Bellarmine, is admitted
by Tillemont, and even by Cæsar Baronius. After having been edited by Morel in Greek and Latin, 1551, it was
omitted from his son’s edition of the works of Gregory by the advice of Fronto Ducæus, lest it should seem to
reflect upon the practice of pilgrimages. But in 1607 it was again edited (Hannov.) by Du Moulin, with a defence
of it, and a translation into French by R. Stephen: this is the only instance of a vernacular version of Gregory at
this time, and shows the importance attached to this Letter. It appears in the second Paris Edition, but with the
vehement protests, printed in the notes, of the Jesuit Gretser, against Du Moulin’s interpretation of its scope,
and even against its genuineness. He makes much of its absence from the Bavarian (Munich) Cod., and of the
fact that even “heretical printers” had omitted it from the Basle Edition of 1562: and he is very angry with Du
Moulin for not having approached the Royal Library while in Paris, and while he had leisure from his “Calvinistic
evening communions.” But why should he, when the Librarian, no less a person than I. Casaubon (appointed
1598), had assured him that the Letter was in the Codex Regius? It is in Migne iii. col. 1009. See Letter to Eustathia,

would do best not to be eager in practising it; but since this matter, when closely looked into,
is found to inflict upon those who have begun to lead the stricter life a moral mischief, it is
so far from being worth an earnest pursuit, that it actually requires the greatest caution to
prevent him who has devoted himself to God from being penetrated by any of its hurtful
influences. What is it, then, that is hurtful in it? The Holy Life is open to all, men and women
alike. Of that contemplative Life the peculiar mark is Modesty1582. But Modesty is preserved
in societies that live distinct and separate, so that there should be no meeting and mixing
up of persons of opposite sex; men are not to rush to keep the rules of Modesty in the
company of women, nor women to do so in the company of men. But the necessities of a
journey are continually apt to reduce this scrupulousness to a very indifferent observance
of such rules. For instance, it is impossible for a woman to accomplish so long a journey
without a conductor; on account of her natural weakness she has to be put upon her horse
and to be lifted down again; she has to be supported1583 in difficult situations. Whichever
we suppose, that she has an acquaintance to do this yeoman’s service, or a hired attendant
to perform it, either way the proceeding cannot escape being reprehensible; whether she
leans on the help of a stranger, or on that of her own servant, she fails to keep the law of
correct conduct; and as the inns and hostelries and cities of the East present many examples
of licence and of indifference to vice, how will it be possible for one passing through such
smoke to escape without smarting eyes? Where the ear and the eye is defiled, and the heart
too, by receiving all those foulnesses through eye and ear, how will it be possible to thread
without infection such seats of contagion? What advantage, moreover, is reaped by him
who reaches those celebrated spots themselves? He cannot imagine that our Lord is living,
in the body, there at the present day, but has gone away from us foreigners; or that the Holy
Spirit is in abundance at Jerusalem, but unable to travel as far as us. Whereas, if it is really
possible to infer God’s presence from visible symbols, one might more justly consider that
He dwelt in the Cappadocian nation than in any of the spots outside it. For how many Altars1584
there are there, on which the name of our Lord is glorified! One could hardly count
so many in all the rest of the world. Again, if the Divine grace was more abundant about
Jerusalem than elsewhere, sin would not be so much the fashion amongst those that live
there; but as it is, there is no form of uncleanness1585 that is not perpetrated amongst them;
rascality, adultery, theft, idolatry, poisoning, quarrelling, murder, are rife; and the last kind

of evil is so excessively prevalent, that nowhere in the world are people so ready to kill each
other as there; where kinsmen attack each other like wild beasts, and spill each other’s blood,
merely for the sake of lifeless plunder. Well, in a place where such things go on, what proof,
I ask, have you of the abundance of Divine grace? But I know what many will retort to all
that I have said; they will say, “Why did you not lay down this rule for yourself as well? If
there is no gain for the godly pilgrim in return for having been there, for what reason did
you undergo the toil of so long a journey?” Let them hear from me my plea for this. By the
necessities of that office in which I have been placed by the Dispenser of my life to live, it
was my duty, for the purpose of the correction which the Holy Council had resolved upon,
to visit the places where the Church in Arabia is; secondly, as Arabia is on the confines of
the Jerusalem district, I had promised that I would confer also with the Heads of the Holy
Jerusalem Churches, because matters with them were in confusion, and needed an arbiter;
thirdly, our most religious Emperor had granted us facilities for the journey, by postal conveyance,
so that we had to endure none of those inconveniences which in the case of others
we have noticed; our waggon was, in fact, as good as a church or monastery to us, for all of
us were singing psalms and fasting in the Lord during the whole journey. Let our own case
therefore cause difficulty to none; rather let our advice be all the more listened to, because
we are giving it upon matters which came actually before our eyes. We confessed that the
Christ Who was manifested is very God, as much before as after our sojourn at Jerusalem;
our faith in Him was not increased afterwards any more than it was diminished. Before we
saw Bethlehem we knew His being made man by means of the Virgin; before we saw His
Grave we believed in His Resurrection from the dead; apart from seeing the Mount of Olives,
we confessed that His Ascension into heaven was real. We derived only thus much of profit
from our travelling thither, namely that we came to know by being able to compare them,
that our own places are far holier than those abroad. Wherefore, O ye who fear the Lord,
praise Him in the places where ye now are. Change of place does not effect any drawing
nearer unto God, but wherever thou mayest be, God will come to thee, if the chambers of
thy soul be found of such a sort that He can dwell in thee and walk in thee. But if thou
keepest thine inner man full of wicked thoughts, even if thou wast on Golgotha, even if thou
wast on the Mount of Olives, even if thou stoodest on the memorial-rock of the Resurrection,
thou wilt be as far away from receiving Christ into thyself, as one who has not even begun
to confess Him. Therefore, my beloved friend, counsel the brethren to be absent from the
body to go to our Lord, rather than to be absent from Cappadocia to go to Palestine; and if
any one should adduce the command spoken by our Lord to His disciples that they should
not quit Jerusalem, let him be made to understand its true meaning. Inasmuch as the gift
and the distribution of the Holy Spirit had not yet passed upon the Apostles, our Lord
commanded them to remain in the same place, until they should have been endued with
power from on high. Now, if that which happened at the beginning, when the Holy Spirit

<pb n="712"/>
was dispensing each of His gifts under the appearance of a flame, continued until now, it
would be right for all to remain in that place where that dispensing took place; but if the
Spirit “bloweth” where He “listeth,” those, too, who have become believers here are made
partakers of that gift; and that according to the proportion of their faith, not in consequence
of their pilgrimage to Jerusalem.</p>

<head>Note on the Treatise “On the Making of Man.”</head>
<p>This work was intended to supplement and complete the Hexaëmeron of S. Basil, and
presupposes an acquaintance with that treatise. The narrative of the creation of the world
is not discussed in detail: it is referred to, but chiefly in order to insist on the idea that the
world was prepared to be the sphere of man’s sovereignty. On the other hand, Gregory
shows that man was made “with circumspection,” fitted by nature for rule over the other
creatures, made in the likeness of God in respect of various moral attributes, and in the
possession of reason, while differing from the Divine nature in that the human mind receives
its information by means of the senses and is dependent on them for its perception of external
things. The body is fitted to be the instrument of the mind, adapted to the use of a
reasonable being: and it is by the possession of the “rational soul,” as well as of the “natural”
or “vegetative” and the “sensible” soul, that man differs from the lower animals. At the same
time, his mind works by means of the senses: it is incomprehensible in its nature (resembling
in this the Divine nature of which it is the image), and its relation to the body is discussed
at some length (chs. 12–15). The connection between mind and body is ineffable: it is not
to be accounted for by supposing that the mind resides in any particular part of the body:
the mind acts upon and is acted upon by the whole body, depending on the corporeal and
material nature for one element of perception, so that perception requires both body and
mind. But it is to the rational element that the name of “soul” properly belongs: the nutritive
and sensible faculties only borrow the name from that which is higher than themselves.
Man was first made “in the image of God:” and this conception excludes the idea of distinction
of sex. In the first creation of man all humanity is included, according to the Divine
foreknowledge: “our whole nature extending from the first to the last” is “one image of Him
Who is.” But for the Fall, the increase of the human race would have taken place as the increase
of the angelic race takes place, in some way unknown to us. The declension of man
from his first estate made succession by generation necessary: and it was because this declension
and its consequences were present to the Divine mind that God “created them male
and female.” In this respect, and in respect of the need of nourishment by food, man is not
“in the image of God,” but shows his kindred with the lower creation. But these necessities
are not permanent: they will end with the restoration of man to his former excellence (chs.
16–18). Here Gregory is led to speak (chs. 19–20) of the food of man in Paradise, and of the
“tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” And thus, having made mention of the Fall of
man, he goes on to speak of his Restoration. This, in his view, follows from the finite nature
of evil: it is deferred until the sum of humanity is complete. As to the mode in which the
present state of things will end, we know nothing: but that it will end is inferred from the
non-eternity of matter (chs. 21–24). The doctrine of the Resurrection is supported by our

<pb n="715"/>
knowledge of the accuracy with which other events have been predicted in Scripture, by the
experience given to us of like events in particular cases, in those whom our Lord raised to
life, and especially in His own resurrection. The argument that such a restoration is impossible
is met by an appeal to the unlimited character of the Divine power, and by inferences
from parallels observed in nature (chs. 25–27). Gregory then proceeds to deal with the
question of the pre-existence of the soul, rejecting that opinion, and maintaining that the
body and the soul come into existence together, potentially in the Divine will, actually at
the moment when each individual man comes into being by generation (chs. 28–29). In the
course of his argument on this last point, he turns aside to discuss at some length, in the
last chapter, the structure of the human body: but he returns once more, in conclusion, to
his main position, that man “is generated as a living and animated being,” and that the
power of the soul is gradually manifested in, and by means of, the material substratum of
the body; so that man is brought to perfection by the aid of the lower attributes of the soul.
But the true perfection of the soul is not in these, which will ultimately be “put away,” but
in the higher attributes which constitute for man “the image of God.”</p>

<head>On the Making of Man.</head>
<p>Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, to his brother Peter, the servant of God.</p>
<p>If we had to honour with rewards of money those who excel in virtue, the whole world
of money, as Solomon says1586, would seem but small to be made equal to your virtue in
the balance. Since, however, the debt of gratitude due to your Reverence is greater than can
be valued in money, and the holy Eastertide demands the accustomed gift of love, we offer
to your greatness of mind, O man of God, a gift too small indeed to be worthy of presentation
to you, yet not falling short of the extent of our power. The gift is a discourse, like a mean
garment, woven not without toil from our poor wit, and the subject of the discourse, while
it will perhaps be generally thought audacious, yet seemed not unfitting. For he alone has
worthily considered the creation of God who truly was created after God, and whose soul
was fashioned in the image of Him Who created him,—Basil, our common father and
teacher,—who by his own speculation made the sublime ordering of the universe generally
intelligible, making the world as established by God in the true Wisdom known to those
who by means of his understanding are led to such contemplation: but we, who fall short
even of worthily admiring him, yet intend to add to the great writer’s speculations that which
is lacking in them, not so as to interpolate his work by insertion1587 (for it is not to be
thought of that that lofty mouth should suffer the insult of being given as authority for our
discourses), but so that the glory of the teacher may not seem to be failing among his disciples.</p>
<p>For if, the consideration of man being lacking in his Hexaëmeron, none of those who
had been his disciples contributed any earnest effort to supply the defect, the scoffer would
perhaps have had a handle against his great fame, on the ground that he had not cared to
produce in his hearers any habit of intelligence. But now that we venture according to our
powers upon the exposition of what was lacking, if anything should be found in our work
such as to be not unworthy of his teaching, it will surely be referred to our teacher: while if
our discourse does not reach the height of his sublime speculation, he will be free from this
charge and escape the blame of seeming not to wish that his disciples should have any skill
at all, though we perhaps may be answerable to our censurers as being unable to contain in
the littleness of our heart the wisdom of our instructor.</p>
<p>The scope of our proposed enquiry is not small: it is second to none of the wonders of
the world,—perhaps even greater than any of those known to us, because no other existing
thing, save the human creation, has been made like to God: thus we shall readily find that

allowance will be made for what we say by kindly readers, even if our discourse is far behind
the merits of the subject. For it is our business, I suppose, to leave nothing unexamined of
all that concerns man,—of what we believe to have taken place previously, of what we now
see, and of the results which are expected afterwards to appear (for surely our effort would
be convicted of failing of its promise, if, when man is proposed for contemplation, any of
the questions which bear upon the subject were to be omitted); and, moreover, we must fit
together, according to the explanation of Scripture and to that derived from reasoning, those
statements concerning him which seem, by a kind of necessary sequence, to be opposed, so
that our whole subject may be consistent in train of thought and in order, as the statements
that seem to be contrary are brought (if the Divine power so discovers a hope for what is
beyond hope, and a way for what is inextricable) to one and the same end: and for clearness’
sake I think it well to set forth to you the discourse by chapters, that you may be able briefly
to know the force of the several arguments of the whole work.</p>
<p>1. Wherein is a partial inquiry into the nature of the world, and a more minute exposition
of the things which preceded the genesis of man.</p>
<p>2. Why man appeared last, after the creation.</p>
<p>3. That the nature of man is more precious than all the visible creation.</p>
<p>4. That the construction of man throughout signifies his ruling power.</p>
<p>5. That man is a likeness of the Divine sovereignty.</p>
<p>6. An examination of the kindred of mind to nature: wherein by way of digression is
refuted the doctrine of the Anomoeans.</p>
<p>7. Why man is destitute of natural weapons and covering.</p>
<p>8. Why man’s form is upright, and that hands were given him because of reason; wherein
also is a speculation on the difference of souls.</p>
<p>9. That the form of man was framed to serve as an instrument for the use of reason.</p>
<p>10. That the mind works by means of the senses.</p>
<p>11. That the nature of mind is invisible.</p>
<p>12. An examination of the question where the ruling principle is to be considered to
reside; wherein also is a discussion of tears and laughter, and a physiological speculation as
to the interrelation of matter, nature, and mind.</p>
<p>13. A rationale of sleep, of yawning, and of dreams.</p>
<p>14. That the mind is not in a part of the body; wherein also is a distinction of the
movements of the body and of the soul.</p>
<p>15. That the soul proper, in fact and name, is the rational soul, while the others are called
so equivocally: wherein also is this statement, that the power of the mind extends throughout
the whole body in fitting contact with every part.</p>
<p>16. A contemplation of the Divine utterance which said,—“Let us make man after our
image and likeness;” wherein is examined what is the definition of the image, and how the

<pb n="718"/>
passible and mortal is like to the Blessed and Impassible, and how in the image there are
male and female, seeing these are not in the Prototype.</p>
<p>17. What we must answer to those who raise the question—“If procreation is after sin,
how would souls have come into being if the first of mankind had remained sinless?”</p>
<p>18. That our irrational passions have their rise from kindred with irrational nature.</p>
<p>19. To those who say that the enjoyment of the good things we look for will again consist
in meat and drink, because it is written that by these means man at first lived in Paradise.</p>
<p>20. What was the life in Paradise, and what was the forbidden tree.</p>
<p>21. That the resurrection is looked for as a consequence, not so much from the declaration
of Scripture as from the very necessity of things.</p>
<p>22. To those who say, “If the resurrection is a thing excellent and good, how is it that it
has not happened already, but is hoped for in some periods of time?”</p>
<p>23. That he who confesses the beginning of the world’s existence must necessarily agree
also as to its end.</p>
<p>24. An argument against those who say that matter is co-eternal with God.</p>
<p>25. How one even of those who are without may be brought to believe the Scripture
when teaching of the resurrection.</p>
<p>26. That the resurrection is not beyond probability.</p>
<p>27. That it is possible, when the human body is dissolved into the elements of the universe,
that each should have his own body restored from the common source.</p>
<p>28. To those who say that souls existed before bodies, or that bodies were formed before
souls: wherein there is also a refutation of the fables concerning transmigrations of souls.</p>
<p>29. An establishment of the doctrine that the cause of existence of soul and body is one
and the same.</p>
<p>30. A brief consideration of the construction of our bodies from a medical point of view.</p>

<head>I. Wherein is a partial inquiry into the nature of the world, and a more minute exposition of
the things which preceded the genesis of man1588</head>
<p>1. “This is the book of the generation of heaven and earth1589,” saith the Scripture, when
all that is seen was finished, and each of the things that are betook itself to its own separate
place, when the body of heaven compassed all things round, and those bodies which are
heavy and of downward tendency, the earth and the water, holding each other in, took the
middle place of the universe; while, as a sort of bond and stability for the things that were
made, the Divine power and skill was implanted in the growth of things, guiding all things
with the reins of a double operation (for it was by rest and motion that it devised the genesis
of the things that were not, and the continuance of the things that are), driving around,
about the heavy and changeless element contributed by the creation that does not move, as
about some fixed path, the exceedingly rapid motion of the sphere, like a wheel, and preserving
the indissolubility of both by their mutual action, as the circling substance by its
rapid motion compresses the compact body of the earth round about, while that which is
firm and unyielding, by reason of its unchanging fixedness, continually augments the
whirling motion of those things which revolve round it, and intensity1590 is produced in
equal measure in each of the natures which thus differ in their operation, in the stationary
nature, I mean, and in the mobile revolution; for neither is the earth shifted from its own
base, nor does the heaven ever relax in its vehemence, or slacken its motion.</p>
<p>2. These, moreover, were first framed before other things, according to the Divine wisdom,
to be as it were a beginning of the whole machine, the great Moses indicating, I suppose,
where he says that the heaven and the earth were made by God “in the beginning1591” that
all things that are seen in the creation are the offspring of rest and motion, brought into
being by the Divine will. Now the heaven and the earth being diametrically opposed to each
other in their operations, the creation which lies between the opposites, and has in part a
share in what is adjacent to it, itself acts as a mean between the extremes, so that there is
manifestly a mutual contact of the opposites through the mean; for air in a manner imitates
the perpetual motion and subtlety of the fiery substance, both in the lightness of its nature,
and in its suitableness for motion; yet it is not such as to be alienated from the solid substance,
for it is no more in a state of continual flux and dispersion than in a permanent state of
<note type="footnote">1588 A Bodleian ms. of the Latin version, cited by Forbes, which gives independent titles, has here:—“Of the
perfection and beauty of the world and of the harmonious discord of the four elements.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1589 Gen. ii. 4 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">1590 ὑπερβόλη apparently means “intensity” or “a high degree of force,” not “excess of force,” since, though
the force in each is augmented, it does not exceed that in the other, which is augmented also pari passu.</note>
<note type="footnote">1591 Gen. i. 1.</note>

Wherein is a partial inquiry into the nature of the world, and a more minute…
immobility, but becomes, in its affinity to each, a kind of borderland of the opposition
between operations, at once uniting in itself and dividing things which are naturally distinct.</p>
<p>3. In the same way, liquid substance also is attached by double qualities to each of the
opposites; for in so far as it is heavy and of downward tendency it is closely akin to the
earthy; but in so far as it partakes of a certain fluid and mobile energy it is not altogether
alien from the nature which is in motion; and by means of this also there is effected a kind
of mixture and concurrence of the opposites, weight being transferred to motion, and motion
finding no hindrance in weight, so that things most extremely opposite in nature combine
with one another, and are mutually joined by those which act as means between them.</p>
<p>4. But to speak strictly, one should rather say that the very nature of the contraries
themselves is not entirely without mixture of properties, each with the other, so that, as I
think, all that we see in the world mutually agree, and the creation, though discovered in
properties of contrary natures, is yet at union with itself. For as motion is not conceived
merely as local shifting, but is also contemplated in change and alteration, and on the other
hand the immovable nature does not admit motion by way of alteration, the wisdom of God
has transposed these properties, and wrought unchangeableness in that which is ever moving,
and change in that which is immovable; doing this, it may be, by a providential dispensation,
so that that property of nature which constitutes its immutability and immobility might
not, when viewed in any created object, cause the creature to be accounted as God; for that
which may happen to move or change would cease to admit of the conception of Godhead.
Hence the earth is stable without being immutable, while the heaven, on the contrary, as it
has no mutability, so has not stability either, that the Divine power, by interweaving change
in the stable nature and motion with that which is not subject to change, might, by the interchange
of attributes, at once join them both closely to each other, and make them alien
from the conception of Deity; for as has been said, neither of these (neither that which is
unstable, nor that which is mutable) can be considered to belong to the more Divine nature.</p>
<p>5. Now all things were already arrived at their own end: “the heaven and the earth1592,”
as Moses says, “were finished,” and all things that lie between them, and the particular things
were adorned with their appropriate beauty; the heaven with the rays of the stars, the sea
and air with the living creatures that swim and fly, and the earth with all varieties of plants
and animals, to all which, empowered by the Divine will, it gave birth together; the earth
was full, too, of her produce, bringing forth fruits at the same time with flowers; the meadows
were full of all that grows therein, and all the mountain ridges, and summits, and every
hillside, and slope, and hollow, were crowned with young grass, and with the varied produce
of the trees, just risen from the ground, yet shot up at once into their perfect beauty; and all
the beasts that had come into life at God’s command were rejoicing, we may suppose, and
<note type="footnote">1592 Gen. ii. 1.</note>

<pb n="721"/>
skipping about, running to and fro in the thickets in herds according to their kind, while
every sheltered and shady spot was ringing with the chants of the songbirds. And at sea, we
may suppose, the sight to be seen was of the like kind, as it had just settled to quiet and calm
in the gathering together of its depths, where havens and harbours spontaneously hollowed
out on the coasts made the sea reconciled with the land; and the gentle motion of the waves
vied in beauty with the meadows, rippling delicately with light and harmless breezes that
skimmed the surface; and all the wealth of creation by land and sea was ready, and none
was there to share it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
<pb n="722"/>
<head>II. Why man appeared last, after the creation1593</head>
<p>1. For not as yet had that great and precious thing, man, come into the world of being;
it was not to be looked for that the ruler should appear before the subjects of his rule; but
when his dominion was prepared, the next step was that the king should be manifested.
When, then, the Maker of all had prepared beforehand, as it were, a royal lodging for the
future king (and this was the land, and islands, and sea, and the heaven arching like a roof
over them), and when all kinds of wealth had been stored in this palace (and by wealth I
mean the whole creation, all that is in plants and trees, and all that has sense, and breath,
and life; and—if we are to account materials also as wealth—all that for their beauty are
reckoned precious in the eyes of men, as gold and silver, and the substances of your jewels
which men delight in—having concealed, I say, abundance of all these also in the bosom of
the earth as in a royal treasure-house), he thus manifests man in the world, to be the beholder
of some of the wonders therein, and the lord of others; that by his enjoyment he might have
knowledge of the Giver, and by the beauty and majesty of the things he saw might trace out
that power of the Maker which is beyond speech and language.</p>
<p>2. For this reason man was brought into the world last after the creation, not being rejected
to the last as worthless, but as one whom it behoved to be king over his subjects at
his very birth. And as a good host does not bring his guest to his house before the preparation
of his feast, but, when he has made all due preparation, and decked with their proper adornments
his house, his couches, his table, brings his guest home when things suitable for his
refreshment are in readiness,—in the same manner the rich and munificent Entertainer of
our nature, when He had decked the habitation with beauties of every kind, and prepared
this great and varied banquet, then introduced man, assigning to him as his task not the
acquiring of what was not there, but the enjoyment of the things which were there; and for
this reason He gives him as foundations the instincts of a twofold organization, blending
the Divine with the earthy, that by means of both he may be naturally and properly disposed
to each enjoyment, enjoying God by means of his more divine nature, and the good things
of earth by the sense that is akin to them.</p>
<note type="footnote">1593 The title in the Bodleian Latin ms. is:—“That it was reasonable that man should be created last of the
creatures.”</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="723"/>
<head>III. That the nature of man is more precious than all the visible creation1594</head>
<p>1. But it is right that we should not leave this point without consideration, that while
the world, great as it is, and its parts, are laid as an elemental foundation for the formation
of the universe, the creation is, so to say, made offhand by the Divine power, existing at
once on His command, while counsel precedes the making of man; and that which is to be
is foreshown by the Maker in verbal description, and of what kind it is fitting that it should
be, and to what archetype it is fitting that it should bear a likeness, and for what it shall be
made, and what its operation shall be when it is made, and of what it shall be the ruler,—all
these things the saying examines beforehand, so that he has a rank assigned him before his
genesis, and possesses rule over the things that are before his coming into being; for it says,
“God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven, and the
cattle, and all the earth1595.”</p>
<p>2. O marvellous! a sun is made, and no counsel precedes; a heaven likewise; and to these
no single thing in creation is equal. So great a wonder is formed by a word alone, and the
saying indicates neither when, nor how, nor any such detail. So too in all particular cases,
the æther, the stars, the intermediate air, the sea, the earth, the animals, the plants,—all are
brought into being with a word, while only to the making of man does the Maker of all draw
near with circumspection, so as to prepare beforehand for him material for his formation,
and to liken his form to an archetypal beauty, and, setting before him a mark for which he
is to come into being, to make for him a nature appropriate and allied to the operations,
and suitable for the object in hand.</p>
<note type="footnote">1594 The title in the Bodleian Latin ms. is:—“That God created man with great deliberation.”</note>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
<pb n="724"/>
<head>IV. That the construction of man throughout signifies his ruling power1596.</head>
<p>1. For as in our own life artificers fashion a tool in the way suitable to its use, so the best
Artificer made our nature as it were a formation fit for the exercise of royalty, preparing it
at once by superior advantages of soul, and by the very form of the body, to be such as to
be adapted for royalty: for the soul immediately shows its royal and exalted character, far
removed as it is from the lowliness of private station, in that it owns no lord, and is selfgoverned,
swayed autocratically by its own will; for to whom else does this belong than to
a king? And further, besides these facts, the fact that it is the image of that Nature which
rules over all means nothing else than this, that our nature was created to be royal from the
first. For as, in men’s ordinary use, those who make images1597 of princes both mould the
figure of their form, and represent along with this the royal rank by the vesture of purple,
and even the likeness is commonly spoken of as “a king,” so the human nature also, as it
was made to rule the rest, was, by its likeness to the King of all, made as it were a living image,
partaking with the archetype both in rank and in name, not vested in purple, nor giving
indication of its rank by sceptre and diadem (for the archetype itself is not arrayed with
these), but instead of the purple robe, clothed in virtue, which is in truth the most royal of
all raiment, and in place of the sceptre, leaning on the bliss of immortality, and instead of
the royal diadem, decked with the crown of righteousness; so that it is shown to be perfectly
like to the beauty of its archetype in all that belongs to the dignity of royalty.</p>
<note type="footnote">1596 The title in the Bodleian Latin ms. is:—“Of the kingly dignity of the human form.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1597 It is not clear whether the reference here is to painting or to sculpture, of which the product was afterwards
painted. The combination of ἀναμάσσονται and συμπαραγράφουσι suggests the latter.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
<pb n="725"/>
<head>V. That man is a likeness of the Divine sovereignty1598.</head>
<p>1. It is true, indeed, that the Divine beauty is not adorned with any shape or endowment
of form, by any beauty of colour, but is contemplated as excellence in unspeakable bliss. As
then painters transfer human forms to their pictures by the means of certain colours, laying
on their copy the proper and corresponding tints, so that the beauty of the original may be
accurately transferred to the likeness, so I would have you understand that our Maker also,
painting the portrait to resemble His own beauty, by the addition of virtues, as it were with
colours, shows in us His own sovereignty: and manifold and varied are the tints, so to say,
by which His true form is portrayed: not red, or white1599, or the blending of these, whatever
it may be called, nor a touch of black that paints the eyebrow and the eye, and shades, by
some combination, the depressions in the figure, and all such arts which the hands of
painters contrive, but instead of these, purity, freedom from passion, blessedness, alienation
from all evil, and all those attributes of the like kind which help to form in men the likeness
of God: with such hues as these did the Maker of His own image mark our nature.</p>
<p>2. And if you were to examine the other points also by which the Divine beauty is expressed,
you will find that to them too the likeness in the image which we present is perfectly
preserved. The Godhead is mind and word: for “in the beginning was the Word1600” and
the followers of Paul “have the mind of Christ” which “speaks” in them1601: humanity too
is not far removed from these: you see in yourself word and understanding, an imitation of
the very Mind and Word. Again, God is love, and the fount of love: for this the great John
declares, that “love is of God,” and “God is love1602”: the Fashioner of our nature has made
this to be our feature too: for “hereby,” He says, “shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye love one another1603”:—thus, if this be absent, the whole stamp of the likeness is
transformed. The Deity beholds and hears all things, and searches all things out: you too
have the power of apprehension of things by means of sight and hearing, and the understanding
that inquires into things and searches them out.</p>

<head>VI. An examination of the kindred of mind to nature: wherein, by way of digression, is refuted
the doctrine of the Anomoeans1604.</head>
<p>1. And let no one suppose me to say that the Deity is in touch with existing things in a
manner resembling human operation, by means of different faculties. For it is impossible
to conceive in the simplicity of the Godhead the varied and diverse nature of the apprehensive
operation: not even in our own case are the faculties which apprehend things numerous,
although we are in touch with those things which affect our life in many ways by means of
our senses; for there is one faculty, the implanted mind itself, which passes through each of
the organs of sense and grasps the things beyond: this it is that, by means of the eyes, beholds
what is seen; this it is that, by means of hearing, understands what is said; that is content
with what is to our taste, and turns from what is unpleasant; that uses the hand for whatever
it wills, taking hold or rejecting by its means, using the help of the organ for this purpose
precisely as it thinks expedient.</p>
<p>2. If in men, then, even though the organs formed by nature for purposes of perception
may be different, that which operates and moves by means of all, and uses each appropriately
for the object before it, is one and the same, not changing its nature by the differences of
operations, how could any one suspect multiplicity of essence in God on the ground of His
varied powers? for “He that made the eye,” as the prophet says, and “that planted the ear1605,”
stamped on human nature these operations to be as it were significant characters, with reference
to their models in Himself: for He says, “Let us make man in our image1606.”</p>
<p>3. But what, I would ask, becomes of the heresy of the Anomoeans? what will they say
to this utterance? how will they defend the vanity of their dogma in view of the words cited?
Will they say that it is possible that one image should be made like to different forms? if the
Son is in nature unlike the Father, how comes it that the likeness He forms of the different
natures is one? for He Who said, “Let us make after our image,” and by the plural signification
revealed the Holy Trinity, would not, if the archetypes were unlike one another, have mentioned
the image in the singular: for it would be impossible that there should be one likeness
displayed of things which do not agree with one another: if the natures were different he
would assuredly have begun their images also differently, making the appropriate image for
each: but since the image is one, while the archetype is not one, who is so far beyond the
range of understanding as not to know that the things which are like the same thing, surely
resemble one another? Therefore He says (the word, it may be, cutting short this wickedness
at the very formation of human life), “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</p>

<head>VII. Why man is destitute of natural weapons and covering1607</head>
<p>1. But what means the uprightness of his figure? and why is it that those powers which
aid life do not naturally belong to his body? but man is brought into life bare of natural
covering, an unarmed and poor being, destitute of all things useful, worthy, according to
appearances, of pity rather than of admiration, not armed with prominent horns or sharp
claws, nor with hoofs nor with teeth, nor possessing by nature any deadly venom in a
sting,—things such as most animals have in their own power for defence against those who
do them harm: his body is not protected with a covering of hair: and yet possibly it was to
be expected that he who was promoted to rule over the rest of the creatures should be defended
by nature with arms of his own so that he might not need assistance from others for his
own security. Now, however, the lion, the boar, the tiger, the leopard, and all the like have
natural power sufficient for their safety: and the bull has his horn, the hare his speed, the
deer his leap and the certainty of his sight, and another beast has bulk, others a proboscis,
the birds have their wings, and the bee her sting, and generally in all there is some protective
power implanted by nature: but man alone of all is slower than the beasts that are swift of
foot, smaller than those that are of great bulk, more defenceless than those that are protected
by natural arms; and how, one will say, has such a being obtained the sovereignty over all
things?</p>
<p>2. Well, I think it would not be at all hard to show that what seems to be a deficiency of
our nature is a means for our obtaining dominion over the subject creatures. For if man
had had such power as to be able to outrun the horse in swiftness, and to have a foot that,
from its solidity, could not be worn out, but was strengthened by hoofs or claws of some
kind, and to carry upon him horns and stings and claws, he would be, to begin with, a wildlooking
and formidable creature, if such things grew with his body: and moreover he would
have neglected his rule over the other creatures if he had no need of the co-operation of his
subjects; whereas now, the needful services of our life are divided among the individual
animals that are under our sway, for this reason—to make our dominion over them necessary.</p>
<p>3. It was the slowness and difficult motion of our body that brought the horse to supply
our need, and tamed him: it was the nakedness of our body that made necessary our management
of sheep, which supplies the deficiency of our nature by its yearly produce of wool:
it was the fact that we import from others the supplies for our living which subjected beasts
of burden to such service: furthermore, it was the fact that we cannot eat grass like cattle
which brought the ox to render service to our life, who makes our living easy for us by his
own labour; and because we needed teeth and biting power to subdue some of the other

animals by grip of teeth, the dog gave, together with his swiftness, his own jaw to supply
our need, becoming like a live sword for man; and there has been discovered by men iron,
stronger and more penetrating than prominent horns or sharp claws, not, as those things
do with the beasts, always growing naturally with us, but entering into alliance with us for
the time, and for the rest abiding by itself: and to compensate for the crocodile’s scaly hide,
one may make that very hide serve as armour, by putting it on his skin upon occasion: or,
failing that, art fashions iron for this purpose too, which, when it has served him for a time
for war, leaves the man-at-arms once more free from the burden in time of peace: and the
wing of the birds, too, ministers to our life, so that by aid of contrivance we are not left behind
even by the speed of wings: for some of them become tame and are of service to those who
catch birds, and by their means others are by contrivance subdued to serve our needs:
moreover art contrives to make our arrows feathered, and by means of the bow gives us for
our needs the speed of wings: while the fact that our feet are easily hurt and worn in travelling
makes necessary the aid which is given by the subject animals: for hence it comes that we
fit shoes to our feet.</p>

<head>VIII. Why man’s form is upright; and that hands were given him because of reason; wherein
also is a speculation on the difference of souls1608.</head>
<p>1. But man’s form is upright, and extends aloft towards heaven, and looks upwards: and
these are marks of sovereignty which show his royal dignity. For the fact that man alone
among existing things is such as this, while all others bow their bodies downwards, clearly
points to the difference of dignity between those which stoop beneath his sway and that
power which rises above them: for all the rest have the foremost limbs of their bodies in the
form of feet, because that which stoops needs something to support it: but in the formation
of man these limbs were made hands, for the upright body found one base, supporting its
position securely on two feet, sufficient for its needs.</p>
<p>2. Especially do these ministering hands adapt themselves to the requirements of the
reason: indeed if one were to say that the ministration of hands is a special property of the
rational nature, he would not be entirely wrong; and that not only because his thought turns
to the common and obvious fact that we signify our reasoning by means of the natural employment
of our hands in written characters. It is true that this fact, that we speak by writing,
and, in a certain way, converse by the aid of our hands, preserving sounds by the forms of
the alphabet, is not unconnected with the endowment of reason; but I am referring to
something else when I say that the hands co-operate with the bidding of reason.</p>
<p>3. Let us, however, before discussing this point, consider the matter we passed over (for
the subject of the order of created things almost escaped our notice), why the growth of
things that spring from the earth takes precedence, and the irrational animals come next,
and then, after the making of these, comes man: for it may be that we learn from these facts
not only the obvious thought, that grass appeared to the Creator useful for the sake of the
animals, while the animals were made because of man, and that for this reason, before the
animals there was made their food, and before man that which was to minister to human
life.</p>
<p>4. But it seems to me that by these facts Moses reveals a hidden doctrine, and secretly
delivers that wisdom concerning the soul, of which the learning that is without had indeed
some imagination, but no clear comprehension. His discourse then hereby teaches us that
the power of life and soul may be considered in three divisions. For one is only a power of
growth and nutrition supplying what is suitable for the support of the bodies that are
nourished, which is called the vegetative1609 soul, and is to be seen in plants; for we may

the mss. show similar variations. It seems not unlikely that the less common φυτικὸς should have been altered</note>

<pb n="730"/>
perceive in growing plants a certain vital power destitute of sense; and there is another form
of life besides this, which, while it includes the form above mentioned, is also possessed in
addition of the power of management according to sense; and this is to be found in the
nature of the irrational animals: for they are not only the subjects of nourishment and
growth, but also have the activity of sense and perception. But perfect bodily life is seen in
the rational (I mean the human) nature, which both is nourished and endowed with sense,
and also partakes of reason and is ordered by mind.</p>
<p>5. We might make a division of our subject in some such way as this. Of things existing,
part are intellectual, part corporeal. Let us leave alone for the present the division of the intellectual
according to its properties, for our argument is not concerned with these. Of the
corporeal, part is entirely devoid of life, and part shares in vital energy. Of a living body,
again, part has sense conjoined with life, and part is without sense: lastly, that which has
sense is again divided into rational and irrational. For this reason the lawgiver says that after
inanimate matter (as a sort of foundation for the form of animate things), this vegetative
life was made, and had earlier1610 existence in the growth of plants: then he proceeds to
introduce the genesis of those creatures which are regulated by sense: and since, following
the same order, of those things which have obtained life in the flesh, those which have sense
can exist by themselves even apart from the intellectual nature, while the rational principle
could not be embodied save as blended with the sensitive,—for this reason man was made
last after the animals, as nature advanced in an orderly course to perfection. For this rational
animal, man, is blended of every form of soul; he is nourished by the vegetative kind of soul,
and to the faculty of growth was added that of sense, which stands midway, if we regard its
peculiar nature, between the intellectual and the more material essence being as much
coarser than the one as it is more refined than the other: then takes place a certain alliance
and commixture of the intellectual essence with the subtle and enlightened element of the
sensitive nature: so that man consists of these three: as we are taught the like thing by the
apostle in what he says to the Ephesians1611, praying for them that the complete grace of
their “body and soul and spirit” may be preserved at the coming of the Lord; using, the word
“body” for the nutritive part, and denoting the sensitive by the word “soul,” and the intellectual
by “spirit.” Likewise too the Lord instructs the scribe in the Gospel that he should set
before every commandment that love to God which is exercised with all the heart and soul
and mind1612: for here also it seems to me that the phrase indicates the same difference,
<note type="footnote">by copyists to φυσικός. But Gregory seems in this treatise to use the word φύσις for the corporeal nature: and
he may have employed the adjectival form in a corresponding sense.</note>
<note type="footnote">1610 Earlier, i.e. earlier than the animal life, or “sensitive” soul.</note>

<pb n="731"/>
naming the more corporeal existence “heart,” the intermediate “soul,” and the higher nature,
the intellectual and mental faculty, “mind.”</p>
<p>6. Hence also the apostle recognizes three divisions of dispositions, calling one “carnal,”
which is busied with the belly and the pleasures connected with it, another “natural1613,”
which holds a middle position with regard to virtue and vice, rising above the one, but
without pure participation in the other; and another “spiritual,” which perceives the perfection
of godly life: wherefore he says to the Corinthians, reproaching their indulgence in
pleasure and passion, “Ye are carnal1614,” and incapable of receiving the more perfect doctrine;
while elsewhere, making a comparison of the middle kind with the perfect, he says,
“but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit: for they are foolishness unto him:
but he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man1615.” As, then,
the natural man is higher than the carnal, by the same measure also the spiritual man rises
above the natural.</p>
<p>7. If, therefore, Scripture tells us that man was made last, after every animate thing, the
lawgiver is doing nothing else than declaring to us the doctrine of the soul, considering that
what is perfect comes last, according to a certain necessary sequence in the order of things:
for in the rational are included the others also, while in the sensitive there also surely exists
the vegetative form, and that again is conceived only in connection with what is material:
thus we may suppose that nature makes an ascent as it were by steps—I mean the various
properties of life—from the lower to the perfect form.</p>
<p>81616. Now since man is a rational animal, the instrument of his body must be made
suitable for the use of reason1617; as you may see musicians producing their music according
to the form of their instruments, and not piping with harps nor harping upon flutes, so it
must needs be that the organization of these instruments of ours should be adapted for
reason, that when struck by the vocal organs it might be able to sound properly for the use
of words. For this reason the hands were attached to the body; for though we can count up
very many uses in daily life for which these skilfully contrived and helpful instruments, our
hands, that easily follow every art and every operation, alike in war and peace1618, are ser-

viceable, yet nature added them to our body pre-eminently for the sake of reason. For if
man were destitute of hands, the various parts of his face would certainly have been arranged
like those of the quadrupeds, to suit the purpose of his feeding: so that its form would have
been lengthened out and pointed towards the nostrils, and his lips would have projected
from his mouth, lumpy, and stiff, and thick, fitted for taking up the grass, and his tongue
would either have lain between his teeth, of a kind to match his lips, fleshy, and hard, and
rough, assisting his teeth to deal with what came under his grinder, or it would have been
moist and hanging out at the side like that of dogs and other carnivorous beasts, projecting
through the gaps in his jagged row of teeth. If, then, our body had no hands, how could articulate
sound have been implanted in it, seeing that the form of the parts of the mouth
would not have had the configuration proper for the use of speech, so that man must of
necessity have either bleated, or “baaed,” or barked, or neighed, or bellowed like oxen or
asses, or uttered some bestial sound? but now, as the hand is made part of the body, the
mouth is at leisure for the service of the reason. Thus the hands are shown to be the property
of the rational nature, the Creator having thus devised by their means a special advantage
for reason.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"> 
<pb n="733"/>
<head>IX. That the form of man was framed to serve as an instrument for the use of reason1619.</head>
<p>1. Now since our Maker has bestowed upon our formation a certain Godlike grace, by
implanting in His image the likeness of His own excellences, for this reason He gave, of His
bounty, His other good gifts to human nature; but mind and reason we cannot strictly say
that He gave, but that He imparted them, adding to the image the proper adornment of His
own nature. Now since the mind is a thing intelligible and incorporeal, its grace would have
been incommunicable and isolated, if its motion were not manifested by some contrivance.
For this cause there was still need of this instrumental organization, that it might, like a
plectrum, touch the vocal organs and indicate by the quality of the notes struck, the motion
within.</p>
<p>2. And as some skilled musician, who may have been deprived by some affection of his
own voice, and yet wish to make his skill known, might make melody with voices of others,
and publish his art by the aid of flutes or of the lyre, so also the human mind being a discoverer
of all sorts of conceptions, seeing that it is unable, by the mere soul, to reveal to
those who hear by bodily senses the motions of its understanding, touches, like some skilful
composer, these animated instruments, and makes known its hidden thoughts by means of
the sound produced upon them.</p>
<p>3. Now the music of the human instrument is a sort of compound of flute and lyre,
sounding together in combination as in a concerted piece of music. For the breath, as it is
forced up from the air-receiving vessels through the windpipe, when the speaker’s impulse
to utterance attunes the harmony to sound, and as it strikes against the internal protuberances
which divide this flute-like passage in a circular arrangement, imitates in a way the sound
uttered through a flute, being driven round and round by the membranous projections. But
the palate receives the sound from below in its own concavity, and dividing the sound by
the two passages that extend to the nostrils, and by the cartilages about the perforated bone,
as it were by some scaly protuberance, makes its resonance louder; while the cheek, the
tongue, the mechanism of the pharynx by which the chin is relaxed when drawn in, and
tightened when extended to a point—all these in many different ways answer to the motion
of the plectrum upon the strings, varying very quickly, as occasion requires, the arrangement
of the tones; and the opening and closing of the lips has the same effect as players produce
when they check the breath of the flute with their fingers according to the measure of the
tune.</p>

<head>X. That the mind works by means of the senses.</head>
<p>1. As the mind then produces the music of reason by means of our instrumental construction,
we are born rational, while, as I think, we should not have had the gift of reason
if we had had to employ our lips to supply the need of the body—the heavy and toilsome
part of the task of providing food. As things are, however, our hands appropriate this ministration
to themselves, and leave the mouth available for the service of reason.</p>
<p>21620. The operation of the instrument1621, however, is twofold; one for the production
of sound, the other for the reception of concepts from without; and the one faculty does not
blend with the other, but abides in the operation for which it was appointed by nature, not
interfering with its neighbour either by the sense of hearing undertaking to speak, or by the
speech undertaking to hear; for the latter is always uttering something, while the ear, as
Solomon somewhere says, is not filled with continual hearing1622.</p>
<p>3. That point as to our internal faculties which seems to me to be even in a special degree
matter for wonder, is this:—what is the extent of that inner receptacle into which flows
everything that is poured in by our hearing? who are the recorders of the sayings that are
brought in by it? what sort of storehouses are there for the concepts that are being put in
by our hearing? and how is it, that when many of them, of varied kinds, are pressing one
upon another, there arises no confusion and error in the relative position of the things that
are laid up there? And one may have the like feeling of wonder also with regard to the operation
of sight; for by it also in like manner the mind apprehends those things which are external
to the body, and draws to itself the images of phenomena, marking in itself the impressions
of the things which are seen.</p>
<p>4. And just as if there were some extensive city receiving all comers by different entrances,
all will not congregate at any particular place, but some will go to the market, some to the
houses, others to the churches, or the streets, or lanes, or the theatres, each according to his
own inclination,—some such city of our mind I seem to discern established in us, which
the different entrances through the senses keep filling, while the mind, distinguishing and
examining each of the things that enters, ranks them in their proper departments of knowledge.</p>
<p>5. And as, to follow the illustration of the city, it may often be that those who are of the
same family and kindred do not enter by the same gate, coming in by different entrances,
as it may happen, but are none the less, when they come within the circuit of the wall,
brought together again, being on close terms with each other (and one may find the contrary
happen; for those who are strangers and mutually unknown often take one entrance to the
<note type="footnote">1620 Here the Latin version begins chapter x. The title in the Bodleian ms. is:—“Of the five bodily senses.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1621 That is, of the mind, in connection with reason.</note>

<pb n="735"/>
city, yet their community of entrance does not bind them together; for even when they are
within they can be separated to join their own kindred); something of the same kind I seem
to discern in the spacious territory of our mind; for often the knowledge which we gather
from the different organs of sense is one, as the same object is divided into several parts in
relation to the senses; and again, on the contrary, we may learn from some one sense many
and varied things which have no affinity one with another.</p>
<p>6. For instance—for it is better to make our argument clear by illustration—let us suppose
that we are making some inquiry into the property of tastes—what is sweet to the sense, and
what is to be avoided by tasters. We find, then, by experience, both the bitterness of gall and
the pleasant character of the quality of honey; but when these facts are known, the knowledge
is one which is given to us (the same thing being introduced to our understanding in several
ways) by taste, smell, hearing, and often by touch and sight. For when one sees honey, and
hears its name, and receives it by taste, and recognizes its odour by smell, and tests it by
touch, he recognizes the same thing by means of each of his senses.</p>
<p>7. On the other hand we get varied and multiform information by some one sense, for
as hearing receives all sorts of sounds, and our visual perception exercises its operation by
beholding things of different kinds—for it lights alike on black and white, and all things
that are distinguished by contrariety of colour,—so with taste, with smell, with perception
by touch; each implants in us by means of its own perceptive power the knowledge of things
of every kind.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11"> 
<pb n="736"/>
<head>XI. That the nature of mind is invisible.1623</head>
<p>1. What then is, in its own nature, this mind that distributes itself into faculties of sensation,
and duly receives, by means of each, the knowledge of things? That it is something
else besides the senses, I suppose no reasonable man doubts; for if it were identical with
sense, it would reduce the proper character of the operations carried on by sense to one, on
the ground that it is itself simple, and that in what is simple no diversity is to be found. Now
however, as all agree that touch is one thing and smell another, and as the rest of the senses
are in like manner so situated with regard to each other as to exclude intercommunion or
mixture, we must surely suppose, since the mind is duly present in each case, that it is
something else besides the sensitive nature, so that no variation may attach to a thing intelligible.</p>
<p>2. “Who hath known the mind of the Lord1624?” the apostle asks; and I ask further, who
has understood his own mind? Let those tell us who consider the nature of God to be within
their comprehension, whether they understand themselves—if they know the nature of their
own mind. “It is manifold and much compounded.” How then can that which is intelligible
be composite? or what is the mode of mixture of things that differ in kind? Or, “It is simple,
and incomposite.” How then is it dispersed into the manifold divisions of the senses? how
is there diversity in unity? how is unity maintained in diversity?</p>
<p>3. But I find the solution of these difficulties by recourse to the very utterance of God;
for He says, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness1625.” The image is properly
an image so long as it fails in none of those attributes which we perceive in the archetype;
but where it falls from its resemblance to the prototype it ceases in that respect to be an
image; therefore, since one of the attributes we contemplate in the Divine nature is incomprehensibility
of essence, it is clearly necessary that in this point the image should be able
to show its imitation of the archetype.</p>
<p>4. For if, while the archetype transcends comprehension, the nature of the image were
comprehended, the contrary character of the attributes we behold in them would prove the
defect of the image; but since the nature of our mind, which is the likeness of the Creator
evades our knowledge, it has an accurate resemblance to the superior nature, figuring by
its own unknowableness the incomprehensible Nature.</p>

<head>XII. An examination of the question where the ruling principle is to be considered to reside;
wherein also is a discussion of tears and laughter, and a physiological speculation as to
the inter-relation of matter, nature, and mind.1626</head>
<p>1. Let there be an end, then, of all the vain and conjectural discussion of those who
confine the intelligible energy to certain bodily organs; of whom some lay it down that the
ruling principle is in the heart, while others say that the mind resides in the brain,
strengthening such opinions by some plausible superficialities. For he who ascribes the
principal authority to the heart makes its local position evidence of his argument (because
it seems that it somehow occupies the middle position in the body1627), on the ground that
the motion of the will is easily distributed from the centre to the whole body, and so proceeds
to operation; and he makes the troublesome and passionate disposition of man a testimony
for his argument, because such affections seem to move this part sympathetically. Those,
on the other hand, who consecrate the brain to reasoning, say that the head has been built
by nature as a kind of citadel of the whole body, and that in it the mind dwells like a king,
with a bodyguard of senses surrounding it like messengers and shield-bearers. And these
find a sign of their opinion in the fact that the reasoning of those who have suffered some
injury to the membrane of the brain is abnormally distorted, and that those whose heads
are heavy with intoxication ignore what is seemly.</p>
<p>2. Each of those who uphold these views puts forward some reasons of a more physical
character on behalf of his opinion concerning the ruling principle. One declares that the
motion which proceeds from the understanding is in some way akin to the nature of fire,
because fire and the understanding are alike in perpetual motion; and since heat is allowed
to have its source in the region of the heart, he says on this ground that the motion of mind
is compounded with the mobility of heat, and asserts that the heart, in which heat is enclosed,
is the receptacle of the intelligent nature. The other declares that the cerebral membrane
(for so they call the tissue that surrounds the brain) is as it were a foundation or root of all
the senses, and hereby makes good his own argument, on the ground that the intellectual
energy cannot have its seat save in that part where the ear, connected with it, comes into
concussion with the sounds that fall upon it, and the sight (which naturally belongs to the
hollow of the place where the eyes are situated) makes its internal representation by means
of the images that fall upon the pupils, while the qualities of scents are discerned in it by
being drawn in through the nose, and the sense of taste is tried by the test of the cerebral
membrane, which sends down from itself, by the veterbræ of the neck, sensitive nerve-processes
to the isthmoidal passage, and unites them with the muscles there.</p>
<note type="footnote">1626 In the Latin version chap. xii. includes only §§1—8 (incl.), to which the Bodleian ms. gives the title:—“That
the principle of man does not all reside in the brain, but in the whole body.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1627 This view of the position of the heart is perhaps shared by Gregory himself: see e.g. ch. xxx. §15.</note>

<pb n="738"/>
<p>3. I admit it to be true that the intellectual part of the soul is often disturbed by prevalence
of passions; and that the reason is blunted by some bodily accident so as to hinder its natural
operation; and that the heart is a sort of source of the fiery element in the body, and is moved
in correspondence with the impulses of passion; and moreover, in addition to this, I do not
reject (as I hear very much the same account from those who spend their time on anatomical
researches) the statement that the cerebral membrane (according to the theory of those
who take such a physiological view), enfolding in itself the brain, and steeped in the vapours
that issue from it, forms a foundation for the senses; yet I do not hold this for a proof that
the incorporeal nature is bounded by any limits of place.</p>
<p>4. Certainly we are aware that mental aberrations do not arise from heaviness of head
alone, but skilled physicians declare that our intellect is also weakened by the membranes
that underlie the sides being affected by disease, when they call the disease frenzy, since the
name given to those membranes is φρένες. And the sensation resulting from sorrow is
mistakenly supposed to arise at the heart; for while it is not the heart, but the entrance of
the belly that is pained, people ignorantly refer the affection to the heart. Those, however,
who have carefully studied the affections in question give some such account as follows:—by
a compression and closing of the pores, which naturally takes place over the whole body in
a condition of grief, everything that meets a hindrance in its passage is driven to the cavities
in the interior of the body, and hence also (as the respiratory organs too are pressed by what
surrounds them), the drawing of breath often becomes more violent under the influence of
nature endeavouring to widen what has been contracted, so as to open out the compressed
passages; and such breathing we consider a symptom of grief and call it a groan or a shriek.
That, moreover, which appears to oppress the region of the heart is a painful affection, not
of the heart, but of the entrance of the stomach, and occurs from the same cause (I mean,
that of the compression of the pores), as the vessel that contains the bile, contracting, pours
that bitter and pungent juice upon the entrance of the stomach; and a proof of this is that
the complexion of those in grief becomes sallow and jaundiced, as the bile pours its own
juice into the veins by reason of excessive pressure.</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, the opposite affection, that, I mean, of mirth and laughter, contributes
to establish the argument; for the pores of the body, in the case of those who are dissolved
in mirth by hearing something pleasant, are also somehow dissolved and relaxed. Just as in
the former case the slight and insensible exhalations of the pores are checked by grief, and,
as they compress the internal arrangement of the higher viscera, drive up towards the head
and the cerebral membrane the humid vapour which, being retained in excess by the cavities
of the brain, is driven out by the pores at its base1628, while the closing of the eyelids expels
<note type="footnote">1628 διὰ τῶν κατὰ τὴν βάσιν πόρων. The meaning of this is obscure. If we might read τῶν κατὰ τὴν ὀψιν
πόρων, we should have a parallel to τοῦ κατὰ τὸ στόμα πόρου below. But there seems to be no variation in the
mss.</note>

<pb n="739"/>
the moisture in the form of drops (and the drop is called a tear), so I would have you think
that when the pores, as a result of the contrary condition, are unusually widened, some air
is drawn in through them into the interior, and thence again expelled by nature through
the passage of the mouth, while all the viscera (and especially, as they say, the liver) join in
expelling this air by a certain agitation and throbbing motion; whence it comes that nature,
contriving to give facility for the exit of the air, widens the passage of the mouth, extending
the cheeks on either side round about the breath; and the result is called laughter.</p>
<p>6. We must not, then, on this account ascribe the ruling principle any more to the liver
than we must think, because of the heated state of the blood about the heart in wrathful
dispositions, that the seat of the mind is in the heart; but we must refer these matters to the
character of our bodily organization, and consider that the mind is equally in contact with
each of the parts according to a kind of combination which is indescribable.</p>
<p>7. Even if any should allege to us on this point the Scripture which claims the ruling
principle for the heart, we shall not receive the statement without examination; for he who
makes mention of the heart speaks also of the reins, when he says, “God trieth the hearts
and reins”1629; so that they must either confine the intellectual principle to the two combined
or to neither.</p>
<p>8. And although I am aware that the intellectual energies are blunted, or even made altogether
ineffective in a certain condition of the body, I do not hold this a sufficient evidence
for limiting the faculty of the mind by any particular place, so that it should be forced out
of its proper amount of free space by any inflammations that may arise in the neighbouring
parts of the body1630 (for such an opinion is a corporeal one, that when the receptacle is
already occupied by something placed in it, nothing else can find place there); for the intelligible
nature neither dwells in the empty spaces of bodies, nor is extruded by encroachments
of the flesh; but since the whole body is made like some musical instrument, just as it often
happens in the case of those who know how to play, but are unable, because the unfitness
of the instrument does not admit of their art, to show their skill (for that which is destroyed
by time, or broken by a fall, or rendered useless by rust or decay, is mute and inefficient,
even if it be breathed upon by one who may be an excellent artist in flute-playing); so too
the mind, passing over the whole instrument, and touching each of the parts in a mode
corresponding to its intellectual activities, according to its nature, produces its proper effect
on those parts which are in a natural condition, but remains inoperative and ineffective
upon those which are unable to admit the movement of its art; for the mind is somehow
naturally adapted to be in close relation with that which is in a natural condition, but to be
alien from that which is removed from nature.</p>

<pb n="740"/>
<p>9. 1631And here, I think there is a view of the matter more close to nature, by which we
may learn something of the more refined doctrines. For since the most beautiful and supreme
good of all is the Divinity Itself, to which incline all things that have a tendency towards
what is beautiful and good1632, we therefore say that the mind, as being in the image of the
most beautiful, itself also remains in beauty and goodness so long as it partakes as far as is
possible in its likeness to the archetype; but if it were at all to depart from this it is deprived
of that beauty in which it was. And as we said that the mind was adorned1633 by the likeness
of the archetypal beauty, being formed as though it were a mirror to receive the figure of
that which it expresses, we consider that the nature which is governed by it is attached to
the mind in the same relation, and that it too is adorned by the beauty that the mind gives,
being, so to say, a mirror of the mirror; and that by it is swayed and sustained the material
element of that existence in which the nature is contemplated.</p>
<p>10. Thus so long as one keeps in touch with the other, the communication of the true
beauty extends proportionally through the whole series, beautifying by the superior nature
that which comes next to it; but when there is any interruption of this beneficent connection,
or when, on the contrary, the superior comes to follow the inferior, then is displayed the
misshapen character of matter, when it is isolated from nature (for in itself matter is a thing
without form or structure), and by its shapelessness is also destroyed that beauty of nature
with which1634 it is adorned through the mind; and so the transmission of the ugliness of
matter reaches through the nature to the mind itself, so that the image of God is no longer
seen in the figure expressed by that which was moulded according to it; for the mind, setting
the idea of good like a mirror behind the back, turns off the incident rays of the effulgence
of the good, and it receives into itself the impress of the shapelessness of matter.</p>
<note type="footnote">1631 The Latin version (as well as several of the Greek mss.) makes this the beginning of chap. xiii. The
Bodleian ms. gives as the title:—“That as the mind is governed by God, so is the material life of the body by the mind.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1632 καλὸν and τὸ καλὸν seem in the following passage to be used of goodness, alike moral and aesthetic:
once or twice καλὸν seems to be used as equivalent to ἀγαθὸν or as opposed to κακὸν, in a sense capable of
being rendered simply by “good”; it also seems to carry with it in other phrases the distinct idea of aesthetic
goodness, or “beauty,” and the use of κάλλος and καλλωπίζειν, in other phrases still, makes it necessary to
preserve this idea in translation. The phrases “beautiful and good,” or “beauty and goodness,” have therefore
been here adopted to express the single adjective καλὸν.</note>
<note type="footnote">1633 Omitting τοῦ, which Forbes inserts before κατακοσμεῖσθαι: it appears to be found in all the mss., but
its insertion reduces the grammar of the passage to hopeless confusion. Perhaps the true reading is τοῦ
πρωτοτύπου καλλιστοῦ</note>
<note type="footnote">1634 Reading ᾧ, with several of Forbes’ mss., for the ἥof the Paris ed., and the ὅ of Forbes’ text.</note>

<pb n="741"/>
<p>11. And in this way is brought about the genesis of evil, arising through the withdrawal
of that which is beautiful and good. Now all is beautiful and good that is closely related to
the First Good; but that which departs from its relation and likeness to this is certainly
devoid of beauty and goodness. If, then, according to the statement we have been considering,
that which is truly good is one, and the mind itself also has its power of being beautiful and
good, in so far as it is in the image of the good and beautiful, and the nature, which is sustained
by the mind, has the like power, in so far as it is an image of the image, it is hereby
shown that our material part holds together, and is upheld when it is controlled by nature;
and on the other hand is dissolved and disorganized when it is separated from that which
upholds and sustains it, and is dissevered from its conjunction with beauty and goodness.</p>
<p>12. Now such a condition as this does not arise except when there takes place an overturning
of nature to the opposite state, in which the desire has no inclination for beauty and
goodness, but for that which is in need of the adorning element; for it must needs be that
that which is made like to matter, destitute as matter is of form of its own, should be assimilated
to it in respect of the absence alike of form and of beauty.</p>
<p>13. We have, however, discussed these points in passing, as following on our argument,
since they were introduced by our speculation on the point before us; for the subject of enquiry
was, whether the intellectual faculty has its seat in any of the parts of us, or extends
equally over them all; for as for those who shut up the mind locally in parts of the body, and
who advance for the establishment of this opinion of theirs the fact that the reason has not
free course in the case of those whose cerebral membranes are in an unnatural condition,
our argument showed that in respect of every part of the compound nature of man, whereby
every man has some natural operation, the power of the soul remains equally ineffective if
the part does not continue in its natural condition. And thus there came into our argument,
following out this line of thought, the view we have just stated, by which we learn that in
the compound nature of man the mind is governed by God, and that by it is governed our
material life, provided the latter remains in its natural state, but if it is perverted from nature
it is alienated also from that operation which is carried on by the mind.</p>
<p>14. Let us return however once more to the point from which we started—that in those
who are not perverted from their natural condition by some affection, the mind exercises
its own power, and is established firmly in those who are in sound health, but on the contrary
is powerless in those who do not admit its operation; for we may confirm our opinion on
these matters by yet other arguments: and if it is not tedious for those to hear who are already
wearied with our discourse, we shall discuss these matters also, so far as we are able, in a
few words.</p>

<head>XIII. A Rationale of sleep, of yawning, and of dreams1635.</head>
<p>1. This life of our bodies, material and subject to flux, always advancing by way of motion,
finds the power of its being in this, that it never rests from its motion: and as some river,
flowing on by its own impulse, keeps the channel in which it runs well filled, yet is not seen
in the same water always at the same place, but part of it glides away while part comes
flowing on, so, too, the material element of our life here suffers change in the continuity of
its succession of opposites by way of motion and flux, so that it never can desist from change,
but in its inability to rest keeps up unceasingly its motion alternating by like ways1636: and
if it should ever cease moving it will assuredly have cessation also of its being.</p>
<p>2. For instance, emptying succeeds fulness, and on the other hand after emptiness comes
in turn a process of filling: sleep relaxes the strain of waking, and, again, awakening braces
up what had become slack: and neither of these abides continually, but both give way, each
at the other’s coming; nature thus by their interchange so renewing herself as, while partaking
of each in turn, to pass from the one to the other without break. For that the living creature
should always be exerting itself in its operations produces a certain rupture and severance
of the overstrained part; and continual quiescence of the body brings about a certain dissolution
and laxity in its frame: but to be in touch with each of these at the proper times in a
moderate degree is a staying-power of nature, which, by continual transference to the opposed
states, gives herself in each of them rest from the other. Thus she finds the body on the strain
through wakefulness, and devises relaxation for the strain by means of sleep, giving the
perceptive faculties rest for the time from their operations, loosing them like horses from
the chariots after the race.</p>
<p>3. Further, rest at proper times is necessary for the framework of the body, that the nutriment
may be diffused over the whole body through the passages which it contains, without
any strain to hinder its progress. For just as certain misty vapours are drawn up from the
recesses of the earth when it is soaked with rain, whenever the sun heats it with rays of any
considerable warmth, so a similar result happens in the earth that is in us, when the nutriment
within is heated up by natural warmth; and the vapours, being naturally of upward tendency
and airy nature, and aspiring to that which is above them, come to be in the region of the
head like smoke penetrating the joints of a wall: then they are dispersed thence by exhalation
to the passages of the organs of sense, and by them the senses are of course rendered inactive,
giving way to the transit of these vapours. For the eyes are pressed upon by the eyelids when
<note type="footnote">1635 The Latin version (and with it several of the Greek mss.) makes this the fourteenth chapter. The
Bodleian ms. gives as its title:—“That our body is always in motion.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1636 Life is represented as a succession of opposite states (τῶν ἐναντίων διαδοχὴ), which yet recur again and
again in the same sequence (διὰ τῶν ὁμοίων). This is illustrated in the following section.</note>

<pb n="743"/>
some leaden instrument1637, as it were (I mean such a weight as that I have spoken of), lets
down the eyelid upon the eyes; and the hearing, being dulled by these same vapours, as
though a door were placed upon the acoustic organs, rests from its natural operation: and
such a condition is sleep, when the sense is at rest in the body, and altogether ceases from
the operation of its natural motion, so that the digestive processes of nutriment may have
free course for transmission by the vapours through each of the passages.</p>
<p>4. And for this reason, if the apparatus of the organs of sense should be closed and sleep
hindered by some occupation, the nervous system, becoming filled with the vapours, is
naturally and spontaneously extended so that the part which has had its density increased
by the vapours is rarefied by the process of extension, just as those do who squeeze the water
out of clothes by vehement wringing: and, seeing that the parts about the pharynx are
somewhat circular, and nervous tissue abounds there, whenever there is need for the expulsion
from that part of the density of the vapours—since it is impossible that the part which
is circular in shape should be separated directly, but only by being distended in the outline
of its circumference—for this reason, by checking the breath in a yawn the chin is moved
downwards so as to leave a hollow to the uvula, and all the interior parts being arranged in
the figure of a circle, that smoky denseness which had been detained in the neighbouring
parts is emitted together with the exit of the breath. And often the like may happen even
after sleep when any portion of those vapours remains in the region spoken of undigested
and unexhaled.</p>
<p>5. Hence the mind of man clearly proves its claim1638 to connection with his nature,
itself also co-operating and moving with the nature in its sound and waking state, but remaining
unmoved when it is abandoned to sleep, unless any one supposes that the imagery
of dreams is a motion of the mind exercised in sleep. We for our part say that it is only the
conscious and sound action of the intellect which we ought to refer to mind; and as to the
fantastic nonsense which occurs to us in sleep, we suppose that some appearances of the
operations of the mind are accidentally moulded in the less rational part of the soul; for the
soul, being by sleep dissociated from the senses, is also of necessity outside the range of the
operations of the mind; for it is through the senses that the union of mind with man takes
place; therefore when the senses are at rest, the intellect also must needs be inactive; and an
evidence of this is the fact that the dreamer often seems to be in absurd and impossible
situations, which would not happen if the soul were then guided by reason and intellect.</p>

<pb n="744"/>
<p>6. It seems to me, however, that when the soul is at rest so far as concerns its more excellent
faculties (so far, I mean, as concerns the operations of mind and sense), the nutritive
part of it alone is operative during sleep, and that some shadows and echoes of those things
which happen in our waking moments—of the operations both of sense and of intellect—
which are impressed upon it by that part of the soul which is capable of memory, that
these, I say, are pictured as chance will have it, some echo of memory still lingering in this
division of the soul.</p>
<p>7. With these, then, the man is beguiled, not led to acquaintance with the things that
present themselves by any train of thought, but wandering among confused and inconsequent
delusions. But just as in his bodily operations, while each of the parts individually acts in
some way according to the power which naturally resides in it, there arises also in the limb
that is at rest a state sympathetic with that which is in motion, similarly in the case of the
soul, even if one part is at rest and another in motion, the whole is affected in sympathy
with the part; for it is not possible that the natural unity should be in any way severed, though
one of the faculties included in it is in turn supreme in virtue of its active operation. But as,
when men are awake and busy, the mind is supreme, and sense ministers to it, yet the faculty
which regulates the body is not dissociated from them (for the mind furnishes the food for
its wants, the sense receives what is furnished, and the nutritive faculty of the body appropriates
to itself that which is given to it), so in sleep the supremacy of these faculties is in
some way reversed in us, and while the less rational becomes supreme, the operation of the
other ceases indeed, yet is not absolutely extinguished; but while the nutritive faculty is then
busied with digestion during sleep, and keeps all our nature occupied with itself, the faculty
of sense is neither entirely severed from it (for that cannot be separated which has once been
naturally joined), nor yet can its activity revive, as it is hindered by the inaction during sleep
of the organs of sense; and by the same reasoning (the mind also being united to the sensitive
part of the soul) it would follow that we should say that the mind moves with the latter when
it is in motion, and rests with it when it is quiescent.</p>
<p>8. As naturally happens with fire when it is heaped over with chaff, and no breath fans
the flame—it neither consumes what lies beside it, nor is entirely quenched, but instead of
flame it rises to the air through the chaff in the form of smoke; yet if it should obtain any
breath of air, it turns the smoke to flame—in the same way the mind when hidden by the
inaction of the senses in sleep is neither able to shine out through them, nor yet is quite extinguished,
but has, so to say, a smouldering activity, operating to a certain extent, but unable
to operate farther.</p>
<p>9. Again, as a musician, when he touches with the plectrum the slackened strings of a
lyre, brings out no orderly melody (for that which is not stretched will not sound), but his
hand frequently moves skilfully, bringing the plectrum to the position of the notes so far as
place is concerned, yet there is no sound, except that he produces by the vibration of the

<pb n="745"/>
strings a sort of uncertain and indistinct hum; so in sleep the mechanism of the senses being
relaxed, the artist is either quite inactive, if the instrument is completely relaxed by satiety
or heaviness; or will act slackly and faintly, if the instrument of the senses does not fully
admit of the exercise of its art.</p>
<p>10. For this cause memory is confused, and foreknowledge, though rendered doubtful1639
by uncertain veils, is imaged in shadows of our waking pursuits, and often indicates to us
something of what is going to happen: for by its subtlety of nature the mind has some advantage,
in ability to behold things, over mere corporeal grossness; yet it cannot make its
meaning clear by direct methods, so that the information of the matter in hand should be
plain and evident, but its declaration of the future is ambiguous and doubtful,—what those
who interpret such things call an “enigma.”</p>
<p>11. So the butler presses the cluster for Pharaoh’s cup: so the baker seemed to carry his
baskets; each supposing himself in sleep to be engaged in those services with which he was
busied when awake: for the images of their customary occupations imprinted on the prescient
element of their soul, gave them for a time the power of foretelling, by this sort of prophecy
on the part of the mind, what should come to pass.</p>
<p>12. But if Daniel and Joseph and others like them were instructed by Divine power,
without any confusion of perception, in the knowledge of things to come, this is nothing to
the present statement; for no one would ascribe this to the power of dreams, since he will
be constrained as a consequence to suppose that those Divine appearances also which took
place in wakefulness were not a miraculous vision but a result of nature brought about
spontaneously. As then, while all men are guided by their own minds, there are some few
who are deemed worthy of evident Divine communication; so, while the imagination of
sleep naturally occurs in a like and equivalent manner for all, some, not all, share by means
of their dreams in some more Divine manifestation: but to all the rest even if a foreknowledge
of anything does occur as a result of dreams, it occurs in the way we have spoken of.</p>
<p>13. And again, if the Egyptian and the Assyrian king were guided by God to the knowledge
of the future, the dispensation wrought by their means is a different thing: for it was
necessary that the hidden wisdom of the holy men1640 should be made known, that each of
them might not pass his life without profit to the state. For how could Daniel have been
known for what he was, if the soothsayers and magicians had not been unequal to the task
of discovering the dream? And how could Egypt have been preserved while Joseph was shut
up in prison, if his interpretation of the dream had not brought him to notice? Thus we
must reckon these cases as exceptional, and not class them with common dreams.</p>
<note type="footnote">1639 Reading ἐπιδιστάζουσα with several of Forbes’ mss.</note>
<note type="footnote">1640 “The holy men,” Joseph and Daniel, who were enabled, by the authority they obtained through their
interpretation of dreams, to benefit the state.</note>

<pb n="746"/>
<p>14. But this ordinary seeing of dreams is common to all men, and arises in our fancies
in different modes and forms: for either there remain, as we have said, in the reminiscent
part of the soul, the echoes of daily occupations; or, as often happens, the constitution of
dreams is framed with regard to such and such a condition of the body: for thus the thirsty
man seems to be among springs, the man who is in need of food to be at a feast, and the
young man in the heat of youthful vigour is beset by fancies corresponding to his passion.</p>
<p>15. I also knew another cause of the fancies of sleep, when attending one of my relations
attacked by frenzy; who being annoyed by food being given him in too great quantity for
his strength, kept crying out and finding fault with those who were about him for filling
intestines with dung and putting them upon him: and when his body was rapidly tending
to perspire he blamed those who were with him for having water ready to wet him with as
he lay: and he did not cease calling out till the result showed the meaning of these complaints:
for all at once a copious sweat broke out over his body, and a relaxation of the bowels explained
the weight in the intestines. The same condition then which, while his sober judgment
was dulled by disease, his nature underwent, being sympathetically affected by the condition
of the body—not being without perception of what was amiss, but being unable clearly to
express its pain, by reason of the distraction resulting from the disease—this, probably, if
the intelligent principle of the soul were lulled to rest, not from infirmity but by natural
sleep, might appear as a dream to one similarly situated, the breaking out of perspiration
being expressed by water, and the pain occasioned by the food, by the weight of intestines.</p>
<p>16. This view also is taken by those skilled in medicine, that according to the differences
of complaints the visions of dreams appear differently to the patients: that the visions of
those of weak stomach are of one kind, those of persons suffering from injury to the cerebral
membrane of another, those of persons in fevers of yet another; that those of patients suffering
from bilious and from phlegmatic affections are diverse, and those again of plethoric patients,
and of patients in wasting disease, are different; whence we may see that the nutritive and
vegetative faculty of the soul has in it by commixture some seed of the intelligent element,
which is in some sense brought into likeness to the particular state of the body, being adapted
in its fancies according to the complaint which has seized upon it.</p>
<p>17. Moreover, most men’s dreams are conformed to the state of their character: the
brave man’s fancies are of one kind, the coward’s of another; the wanton man’s dreams of
one kind, the continent man’s of another; the liberal man and the avaricious man are subject
to different fancies; while these fancies are nowhere framed by the intellect, but by the less
rational disposition of the soul, which forms even in dreams the semblances of those things
to which each is accustomed by the practice of his waking hours.</p>

<pb n="747"/>
<head>XIV. That the mind is not in a part of the body; wherein also is a distinction of the movements
of the body and of the soul1641.</head>
<p>1. But we have wandered far from our subject, for the purpose of our argument was to
show that the mind is not restricted to any part of the body, but is equally in touch with the
whole, producing its motion according to the nature of the part which is under its influence.
There are cases, however, in which the mind even follows the bodily impulses, and becomes,
as it were, their servant; for often the bodily nature takes the lead by introducing either the
sense of that which gives pain or the desire for that which gives pleasure, so that it may be
said to furnish the first beginnings, by producing in us the desire for food, or, generally, the
impulse towards some pleasant thing; while the mind, receiving such an impulse, furnishes
the body by its own intelligence with the proper means towards the desired object. Such a
condition, indeed, does not occur in all, save in those of a somewhat slavish disposition,
who bring the reason into bondage to the impulses of their nature and pay servile homage
to the pleasures of sense by allowing them the alliance of their mind; but in the case of more
perfect men this does not happen; for the mind takes the lead, and chooses the expedient
course by reason and not by passion, while their nature follows in the tracks of its leader.</p>
<p>2. But since our argument discovered in our vital faculty three different varieties—one
which receives nourishment without perception, another which at once receives nourishment
and is capable of perception, but is without the reasoning activity, and a third rational,
perfect, and co-extensive with the whole faculty—so that among these varieties the advantage
belongs to the intellectual,—let no one suppose on this account that in the compound nature
of man there are three souls welded together, contemplated each in its own limits, so that
one should think man’s nature to be a sort of conglomeration of several souls. The true and
perfect soul is naturally one, the intellectual and immaterial, which mingles with our material
nature by the agency of the senses; but all that is of material nature, being subject to
mutation and alteration, will, if it should partake of the animating power, move by way of
growth: if, on the contrary, it should fall away from the vital energy, it will reduce its motion
to destruction.</p>
<p>3. Thus, neither is there perception without material substance, nor does the act of
perception take place without the intellectual faculty.</p>
<note type="footnote">1641 This is chapter xv. in the Latin version and some Greek mss. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin gives the
title:—“That the mind is sometimes in servitude to the body, and of its three differences, vital, spiritual, and rational.”</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15"> 
<pb n="748"/>
<head>XV. That the soul proper, in fact and name, is the rational soul, while the others are called so
equivocally; wherein also is this statement, that the power of the mind extends throughout
the whole body in fitting contact with every part1642.</head>
<p>1. Now, if some things in creation possess the nutritive faculty, and others again are
regulated by the perceptive faculty, while the former have no share of perception nor the
latter of the intellectual nature, and if for this reason any one is inclined to the opinion of
a plurality of souls, such a man will be positing a variety of souls in a way not in accordance
with their distinguishing definition. For everything which we conceive among existing
things, if it be perfectly that which it is, is also properly called by the name it bears: but of
that which is not every respect what it is called, the appellation also is vain. For instance:—if
one were to show us true bread, we say that he properly applies the name to the subject: but
if one were to show us instead that which had been made of stone to resemble the natural
bread, which had the same shape, and equal size, and similarity of colour, so as in most
points to be the same with its prototype, but which yet lacks the power of being food, on
this account we say that the stone receives the name of “bread,” not properly, but by a misnomer,
and all things which fall under the same description, which are not absolutely what
they are called, have their name from a misuse of terms.</p>
<p>2. Thus, as the soul finds its perfection in that which is intellectual and rational,
everything that is not so may indeed share the name of “soul,” but is not really soul, but a
certain vital energy associated with the appellation of “soul1643.” And for this reason also
He Who gave laws on every matter, gave the animal nature likewise, as not far removed
from this vegetative life1644, for the use of man, to be for those who partake of it instead of
herbs:—for He says, “Ye shall eat all kinds of flesh even as the green herb1645;” for the perceptive
energy seems to have but a slight advantage over that which is nourished and grows
without it. Let this teach carnal men not to bind their intellect closely to the phenomena of
sense, but rather to busy themselves with their spiritual advantages, as the true soul is found
in these, while sense has equal power also among the brute creation.</p>
<p>3. The course of our argument, however, has diverged to another point: for the subject
of our speculation was not the fact that the energy of mind is of more dignity among the
attributes we conceive in man than the material element of his being, but the fact that the

mind is not confined to any one part of us, but is equally in all and through all, neither
surrounding anything without, nor being enclosed within anything: for these phrases are
properly applied to casks or other bodies that are placed one inside the other; but the union
of the mental with the bodily presents a connection unspeakable and inconceivable,—not
being within it (for the incorporeal is not enclosed in a body), nor yet surrounding it without
(for that which is incorporeal does not include1646 anything), but the mind approaching
our nature in some inexplicable and incomprehensible way, and coming into contact with
it, is to be regarded as both in it and around it, neither implanted in it nor enfolded with it,
but in a way which we cannot speak or think, except so far as this, that while the nature
prospers according to its own order, the mind is also operative; but if any misfortune befalls
the former, the movement of the intellect halts correspondingly.</p>

<head>XVI. A contemplation of the Divine utterance which said—“Let us make man after our image
and likeness”; wherein is examined what is the definition of the image, and how the
passible and mortal is like to the Blessed and Impassible, and how in the image there are
male and female, seeing these are not in the prototype1647.</head>
<p>1. Let us now resume our consideration of the Divine word, “Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness1648.” How mean and how unworthy of the majesty of man are the
fancies of some heathen writers, who magnify humanity, as they supposed, by their comparison
of it to this world! for they say that man is a little world, composed of the same elements
with the universe. Those who bestow on human nature such praise as this by a highsounding
name, forget that they are dignifying man with the attributes of the gnat and the
mouse: for they too are composed of these four elements,—because assuredly about the
animated nature of every existing thing we behold a part, greater or less, of those elements
without which it is not natural that any sensitive being should exist. What great thing is
there, then, in man’s being accounted a representation and likeness of the world,—of the
heaven that passes away, of the earth that changes, of all things that they contain, which
pass away with the departure of that which compasses them round?</p>
<p>2. In what then does the greatness of man consist, according to the doctrine of the
Church? Not in his likeness to the created world, but in his being in the image of the nature
of the Creator.</p>
<p>3. What therefore, you will perhaps say, is the definition of the image? How is the incorporeal
likened to body? how is the temporal like the eternal? that which is mutable by change
like to the immutable? that which is subject to passion and corruption to the impassible and
incorruptible? that which constantly dwells with evil, and grows up with it, to that which is
absolutely free from evil? there is a great difference between that which is conceived in the
archetype, and a thing which has been made in its image: for the image is properly so called
if it keeps its resemblance to the prototype; but if the imitation be perverted from its subject,
the thing is something else, and no longer an image of the subject.</p>
<p>4. How then is man, this mortal, passible, shortlived being, the image of that nature
which is immortal, pure, and everlasting? The true answer to this question, indeed, perhaps
only the very Truth knows: but this is what we, tracing out the truth so far as we are capable
by conjectures and inferences, apprehend concerning the matter. Neither does the word of
God lie when it says that man was made in the image of God, nor is the pitiable suffering
of man’s nature like to the blessedness of the impassible Life: for if any one were to compare
<note type="footnote">1647 Otherwise chap. xvii. The title in the Bodleian ms. of the Latin Version is:—“That the excellence of man
does not consist in the fact that, according to philosophers, he is made after the image of the world, but in the
fact that he is made in the image of God, and how he is made in the image of God.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1648 Gen. i. 26.</note>

<pb n="751"/>
our nature with God, one of two things must needs be allowed in order that the definition
of the likeness may be apprehended in both cases in the same terms,—either that the Deity
is passible, or that humanity is impassible: but if neither the Deity is passible nor our nature
free from passion, what other account remains whereby we may say that the word of God
speaks truly, which says that man was made in the image of God?</p>
<p>5. We must, then, take up once more the Holy Scripture itself, if we may perhaps find
some guidance in the question by means of what is written. After saying, “Let us make man
in our image,” and for what purposes it was said “Let us make him,” it adds this saying:—“and
God created man; in the image of God created He him; male and female created He
them1649.” We have already said in what precedes, that this saying was uttered for the destruction
of heretical impiety, in order that being instructed that the Only-begotten God
made man in the image of God, we should in no wise distinguish the Godhead of the Father
and the Son, since Holy Scripture gives to each equally the name of God,—to Him Who
made man, and to Him in Whose image he was made.</p>
<p>6. However, let us pass by our argument upon this point: let us turn our inquiry to the
question before us,—how it is that while the Deity is in bliss, and humanity is in misery, the
latter is yet in Scripture called “like” the former?</p>
<p>7. We must, then, examine the words carefully: for we find, if we do so, that that which
was made “in the image” is one thing, and that which is now manifested in wretchedness is
another. “God created man,” it says; “in the image of God created He him1650.” There is an
end of the creation of that which was made “in the image”: then it makes a resumption of
the account of creation, and says, “male and female created He them.” I presume that every
one knows that this is a departure from the Prototype: for “in Christ Jesus,” as the apostle
says, “there is neither male nor female1651.” Yet the phrase declares that man is thus divided.</p>
<p>8. Thus the creation of our nature is in a sense twofold: one made like to God, one divided
according to this distinction: for something like this the passage darkly conveys by its arrangement,
where it first says, “God created man, in the image of God created He him1652,”
and then, adding to what has been said, “male and female created He them1653,”—a thing
which is alien from our conceptions of God.</p>
<p>9. I think that by these words Holy Scripture conveys to us a great and lofty doctrine;
and the doctrine is this. While two natures—the Divine and incorporeal nature, and the irrational
life of brutes—are separated from each other as extremes, human nature is the mean

<pb n="752"/>
between them: for in the compound nature of man we may behold a part of each of the
natures I have mentioned,—of the Divine, the rational and intelligent element, which does
not admit the distinction of male and female; of the irrational, our bodily form and structure,
divided into male and female: for each of these elements is certainly to be found in all that
partakes of human life. That the intellectual element, however, precedes the other, we learn
as from one who gives in order an account of the making of man; and we learn also that his
community and kindred with the irrational is for man a provision for reproduction. For he
says first that “God created man in the image of God” (showing by these words, as the
Apostle says, that in such a being there is no male or female): then he adds the peculiar attributes
of human nature, “male and female created He them1654.”</p>
<p>10. What, then, do we learn from this? Let no one, I pray, be indignant if I bring from
far an argument to bear upon the present subject. God is in His own nature all that which
our mind can conceive of good;—rather, transcending all good that we can conceive or
comprehend. He creates man for no other reason than that He is good; and being such, and
having this as His reason for entering upon the creation of our nature, He would not exhibit
the power of His goodness in an imperfect form, giving our nature some one of the things
at His disposal, and grudging it a share in another: but the perfect form of goodness is here
to be seen by His both bringing man into being from nothing, and fully supplying him with
all good gifts: but since the list of individual good gifts is a long one, it is out of the question
to apprehend it numerically. The language of Scripture therefore expresses it concisely by
a comprehensive phrase, in saying that man was made “in the image of God”: for this is the
same as to say that He made human nature participant in all good; for if the Deity is the
fulness of good, and this is His image, then the image finds its resemblance to the Archetype
in being filled with all good.</p>
<p>11. Thus there is in us the principle of all excellence, all virtue and wisdom, and every
higher thing that we conceive: but pre-eminent among all is the fact that we are free from
necessity, and not in bondage to any natural power, but have decision in our own power as
we please; for virtue is a voluntary thing, subject to no dominion: that which is the result of
compulsion and force cannot be virtue.</p>
<p>12. Now as the image bears in all points the semblance of the archetypal excellence, if
it had not a difference in some respect, being absolutely without divergence it would no
longer be a likeness, but will in that case manifestly be absolutely identical with the Prototype.
What difference then do we discern between the Divine and that which has been made like
to the Divine? We find it in the fact that the former is uncreate, while the latter has its being
from creation: and this distinction of property brings with it a train of other properties; for
it is very certainly acknowledged that the uncreated nature is also immutable, and always
<note type="footnote">1654 Gen. i. 27.</note>

<pb n="753"/>
remains the same, while the created nature cannot exist without change; for its very passage
from nonexistence to existence is a certain motion and change of the non-existent transmuted
by the Divine purpose into being.</p>
<p>13. As the Gospel calls the stamp upon the coin “the image of Cæsar1655,” whereby we
learn that in that which was fashioned to resemble Cæsar there was resemblance as to outward
look, but difference as to material, so also in the present saying, when we consider the attri
butes contemplated both in the Divine and human nature, in which the likeness consists,
to be in the place of the features, we find in what underlies them the difference which we
behold in the uncreated and in the created nature.</p>
<p>14. Now as the former always remains the same, while that which came into being by
creation had the beginning of its existence from change, and has a kindred connection with
the like mutation, for this reason He Who, as the prophetical writing says, “knoweth all
things before they be1656,” following out, or rather perceiving beforehand by His power of
foreknowledge what, in a state of independence and freedom, is the tendency of the motion
of man’s will,—as He saw, I say, what would be, He devised for His image the distinction
of male and female, which has no reference to the Divine Archetype, but, as we have said,
is an approximation to the less rational nature.</p>
<p>15. The cause, indeed, of this device, only those can know who were eye-witnesses of
the truth and ministers of the Word; but we, imagining the truth, as far as we can, by means
of conjectures and similitudes, do not set forth that which occurs to our mind authoritatively,
but will place it in the form of a theoretical speculation before our kindly hearers.</p>
<p>16. What is it then which we understand concerning these matters? In saying that “God
created man” the text indicates, by the indefinite character of the term, all mankind; for was
not Adam here named together with the creation, as the history tells us in what follows1657?
yet the name given to the man created is not the particular, but the general name: thus we
are led by the employment of the general name of our nature to some such view as this—that
in the Divine foreknowledge and power all humanity is included in the first creation; for it
<note type="footnote">1655 Cf. S. Matt. xxii. 20, 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">1656 Hist. Sus. 42.</note>
<note type="footnote">1657 The punctuation followed by Forbes here does not seem to give a good sense, and also places S. Gregory
in the position of formally stating that one passage of Genesis contradicts another. By substituting an interrogation
after ἡ ἱστορία φησίν, the sense given is this:—we know from a later statement in Genesis that the name
Adam was given “in the day that they were created” (Gen. v. 2), but here the name given is general, not particular.
There must be a reason for this, and the reason is, that the race of man, and not the individual, is that spoken
of as “created in the image of God.” With this view that all humanity is included in the first creation may be
compared a passage near the end of the De Animâ, where the first man is compared to a full ear of corn, afterwards
“divided into a multitude of bare grain.”</note>

<pb n="754"/>
is fitting for God not to regard any of the things made by Him as indeterminate, but that
each existing thing should have some limit and measure prescribed by the wisdom of its
Maker.</p>
<p>17. Now just as any particular man is limited by his bodily dimensions, and the peculiar
size which is conjoined with the superficies of his body is the measure of his separate existence,
so I think that the entire plenitude of humanity was included by the God of all, by His
power of foreknowledge, as it were in one body, and that this is what the text teaches us
which says, “God created man, in the image of God created He him.” For the image is not
in part of our nature, nor is the grace in any one of the things found in that nature, but this
power extends equally to all the race: and a sign of this is that mind is implanted alike in all:
for all have the power of understanding and deliberating, and of all else whereby the Divine
nature finds its image in that which was made according to it: the man that was manifested
at the first creation of the world, and he that shall be after the consummation of all, are alike:
they equally bear in themselves the Divine image1658.</p>
<p>18. For this reason the whole race was spoken of as one man, namely, that to God’s
power nothing is either past or future, but even that which we expect is comprehended,
equally with what is at present existing, by the all-sustaining energy. Our whole nature, then,
extending from the first to the last, is, so to say, one image of Him Who is; but the distinction
of kind in male and female was added to His work last, as I suppose, for the reason which
follows1659.</p>
<note type="footnote">1658 With this passage, again, may be compared the teaching of the De Animâ on the subject of the Resurrection.</note>

<head>XVII. What we must answer to those who raise the question—“If procreation is after sin, how
would souls have come into being if the first of mankind had remained sinless1660?”</head>
<p>1. It is better for us however, perhaps, rather to inquire, before investigating this point,
the solution of the question put forward by our adversaries; for they say that before the sin
there is no account of birth, or of travail, or of the desire that tends to procreation, but when
they were banished from Paradise after their sin, and the woman was condemned by the
sentence of travail, Adam thus entered with his consort upon the intercourse of married
life, and then took place the beginning of procreation. If, then, marriage did not exist in
Paradise, nor travail, nor birth, they say that it follows as a necessary conclusion that human
souls would not have existed in plurality had not the grace of immortality fallen away to
mortality, and marriage preserved our race by means of descendants, introducing the offspring
of the departing to take their place, so that in a certain way the sin that entered into
the world was profitable for the life of man: for the human race would have remained in the
pair of the first-formed, had not the fear of death impelled their nature to provide succession.</p>
<p>2. Now here again the true answer, whatever it may be, can be clear to those only who,
like Paul, have been instructed in the mysteries of Paradise; but our answer is as follows.
When the Sadducees once argued against the doctrine of the resurrection, and brought
forward, to establish their own opinion, that woman of many marriages, who had been wife
to seven brethren, and thereupon inquired whose wife she will be after the resurrection, our
Lord answered their argument so as not only to instruct the Sadducees, but also to reveal
to all that come after them the mystery of the resurrection-life: “for in the resurrection,” He
says, “they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; neither can they die any more, for they
are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection1661.”
Now the resurrection promises us nothing else than the restoration of the fallen
to their ancient state; for the grace we look for is a certain return to the first life, bringing
back again to Paradise him who was cast out from it. If then the life of those restored is
closely related to that of the angels, it is clear that the life before the transgression was a kind
of angelic life, and hence also our return to the ancient condition of our life is compared to
the angels. Yet while, as has been said, there is no marriage among them, the armies of the
angels are in countless myriads; for so Daniel declared in his visions: so, in the same way,
if there had not come upon us as the result of sin a change for the worse, and removal from
equality with the angels, neither should we have needed marriage that we might multiply;
but whatever the mode of increase in the angelic nature is (unspeakable and inconceivable
by human conjectures, except that it assuredly exists), it would have operated also in the
<note type="footnote">1660 Otherwise Chap. xviii. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin version has the title:—“Against those who say that
sin was a useful introduction for the propagation of the human race; and that by sin it deserved animal generation.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1661 S. Luke xx. 35, 36.</note>

<pb n="756"/>
case of men, who were “made a little lower than the angels1662,” to increase mankind to the
measure determined by its Maker.</p>
<p>3. But if any one finds a difficulty in an inquiry as to the manner of the generation of
souls, had man not needed the assistance of marriage, we shall ask him in turn, what is the
mode of the angelic existence, how they exist in countless myriads, being one essence, and
at the same time numerically many; for we shall be giving a fit answer to one who raises the
question how man would have been without marriage, if we say, “as the angels are without
marriage;” for the fact that man was in a like condition with them before the transgression
is shown by the restoration to that state.</p>
<p>4. Now that we have thus cleared up these matters, let us return to our former
point,—how it was that after the making of His image God contrived for His work the distinction
of male and female. I say that the preliminary speculation we have completed is of
service for determining this question; for He Who brought all things into being and fashioned
Man as a whole by His own will to the Divine image, did not wait to see the number of souls
made up to its proper fulness by the gradual additions of those coming after; but while
looking upon the nature of man in its entirety and fulness by the exercise of His foreknowledge,
and bestowing upon it a lot exalted and equal to the angels, since He saw beforehand
by His all-seeing power the failure of their will to keep a direct course to what is good, and
its consequent declension from the angelic life, in order that the multitude of human souls
might not be cut short by its fall from that mode by which the angels were increased and
multiplied,—for this reason, I say, He formed for our nature that contrivance for increase
which befits those who had fallen into sin, implanting in mankind, instead of the angelic
majesty of nature, that animal and irrational mode by which they now succeed one another.</p>
<p>5. Hence also, it seems to me, the great David pitying the misery of man mourns over
his nature with such words as these, that, “man being in honour knew it not” (meaning by
“honour” the equality with the angels), therefore, he says, “he is compared to the beasts that
have no understanding, and made like unto them1663.” For he truly was made like the beasts,
who received in his nature the present mode of transient generation, on account of his inclination
to material things.</p>

<head>XVIII. That our irrational passions have their rise from kindred with irrational nature.1664</head>
<p>1. For I think that from this beginning all our passions issue as from a spring, and pour
their flood over man’s life; and an evidence of my words is the kinship of passions which
appears alike in ourselves and in the brutes; for it is not allowable to ascribe the first beginnings
of our constitutional liability to passion to that human nature which was fashioned
in the Divine likeness; but as brute life first entered into the world, and man, for the reason
already mentioned, took something of their nature (I mean the mode of generation), he
accordingly took at the same time a share of the other attributes contemplated in that nature;
for the likeness of man to God is not found in anger, nor is pleasure a mark of the superior
nature; cowardice also, and boldness, and the desire of gain, and the dislike of loss, and all
the like, are far removed from that stamp which indicates Divinity.</p>
<p>2. These attributes, then, human nature took to itself from the side of the brutes; for
those qualities with which brute life was armed for self-preservation, when transferred to
human life, became passions; for the carnivorous animals are preserved by their anger, and
those which breed largely by their love of pleasure; cowardice preserves the weak, fear that
which is easily taken by more powerful animals, and greediness those of great bulk; and to
miss anything that tends to pleasure is for the brutes a matter of pain. All these and the like
affections entered man’s composition by reason of the animal mode of generation.</p>
<p>3. I may be allowed to describe the human image by comparison with some wonderful
piece of modelling. For, as one may see in models those carved1665 shapes which the artificers
of such things contrive for the wonder of beholders, tracing out upon a single head two
forms of faces; so man seems to me to bear a double likeness to opposite things—being
moulded in the Divine element of his mind to the Divine beauty, but bearing, in the passionate
impulses that arise in him, a likeness to the brute nature; while often even his reason is
rendered brutish, and obscures the better element by the worse through its inclination and
disposition towards what is irrational; for whenever a man drags down his mental energy
to these affections, and forces his reason to become the servant of his passions, there takes
place a sort of conversion of the good stamp in him into the irrational image, his whole
nature being traced anew after that design, as his reason, so to say, cultivates the beginnings
of his passions, and gradually multiplies them; for once it lends its co-operation to passion,
it produces a plenteous and abundant crop of evils.</p>
<p>4. Thus our love of pleasure took its beginning from our being made like to the irrational
creation, and was increased by the transgressions of men, becoming the parent of so many
<note type="footnote">1664 Otherwise Chap. xix. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin version has the title:—“That our other passions also
are common to us and to the irrational animals, and that by the restraint of them we are said to be like to God.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1665 Reading with Forbes διαγλύφους. The reading διγλύφους of the earlier editt. gives a better sense, but
is not supported by any of Forbes’ mss.</note>

<pb n="758"/>
varieties of sins arising from pleasure as we cannot find among the irrational animals. Thus
the rising of anger in us is indeed akin to the impulse of the brutes; but it grows by the alliance
of thought: for thence come malignity, envy, deceit, conspiracy, hypocrisy; all these are the
result of the evil husbandry of the mind; for if the passion were divested of the aid it receives
from thought, the anger that is left behind is short-lived and not sustained, like a bubble,
perishing straightway as soon as it comes into being. Thus the greediness of swine introduces
covetousness, and the high spirit of the horse becomes the origin of pride; and all the particular
forms that proceed from the want of reason in brute nature become vice by the evil use
of the mind.</p>
<p>5. So, likewise, on the contrary, if reason instead assumes sway over such emotions,
each of them is transmuted to a form of virtue; for anger produces courage, terror caution,
fear obedience, hatred aversion from vice, the power of love the desire for what is truly
beautiful; high spirit in our character raises our thought above the passions, and keeps it
from bondage to what is base; yea, the great Apostle, even, praises such a form of mental
elevation when he bids us constantly to “think those things that are above1666;” and so we
find that every such motion, when elevated by loftiness of mind, is conformed to the beauty
of the Divine image.</p>
<p>6. But the other impulse is greater, as the tendency of sin is heavy and downward; for
the ruling element of our soul is more inclined to be dragged downwards by the weight of
the irrational nature than is the heavy and earthy element to be exalted by the loftiness of
the intellect; hence the misery that encompasses us often causes the Divine gift to be forgotten,
and spreads the passions of the flesh, like some ugly mask, over the beauty of the image.</p>
<p>7. Those, therefore, are in some sense excusable, who do not admit, when they look
upon such cases, that the Divine form is there; yet we may behold the Divine image in men
by the medium of those who have ordered their lives aright. For if the man who is subject
to passion, and carnal, makes it incredible that man was adorned, as it were, with Divine
beauty, surely the man of lofty virtue and pure from pollution will confirm you in the better
conception of human nature.</p>
<p>8. For instance (for it is better to make our argument clear by an illustration), one of
those noted for wickedness—some Jechoniah, say, or some other of evil memory—has obliterated
the beauty of his nature by the pollution of wickedness; yet in Moses and in men
like him the form of the image was kept pure. Now where the beauty of the form has not
been obscured, there is made plain the faithfulness of the saying that man is an image of
God.</p>
<note type="footnote">1666 Col. iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="759"/>
<p>9. It may be, however, that some one feels shame at the fact that our life, like that of the
brutes, is sustained by food, and for this reason deems man unworthy of being supposed to
have been framed in the image of God; but he may expect that freedom from this function
will one day be bestowed upon our nature in the life we look for; for, as the Apostle says,
“the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink1667;” and the Lord declared that “man shall
not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God1668.”
Further, as the resurrection holds forth to us a life equal with the angels, and with the angels
there is no food, there is sufficient ground for believing that man, who will live in like fashion
with the angels, will be released from such a function.</p>

<head>XIX. To those who say that the enjoyment of the good things we look for will again consist in
meat and drink, because it is written that by these means man at first lived in Paradise1669.</head>
<p>1. But some one perhaps will say that man will not be returning to the same form of
life, if as it seems, we formerly existed by eating, and shall hereafter be free from that function.
I, however, when I hear the Holy Scripture, do not understand only bodily meat, or the
pleasure of the flesh; but I recognize another kind of food also, having a certain analogy to
that of the body, the enjoyment of which extends to the soul alone: “Eat of my bread1670,”
is the bidding of Wisdom to the hungry; and the Lord declares those blessed who hunger
for such food as this, and says, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink”: and
“drink ye joy1671,” is the great Isaiah’s charge to those who are able to hear his sublimity.
There is a prophetic threatening also against those worthy of vengeance, that they shall be
punished with famine; but the “famine” is not a lack of bread and water, but a failure of the
word:—“not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of
the Lord1672 .”</p>
<p>2. We ought, then, to conceive that the fruit in Eden was something worthy of God’s
planting (and Eden is interpreted to mean “delight”), and not to doubt that man was hereby
nourished: nor should we at all conceive, concerning the mode of life in Paradise, this
transitory and perishable nutriment: “of every tree of the garden,” He says, “thou mayest
freely eat1673.”</p>
<p>3. Who will give to him that has a healthful hunger that tree that is in Paradise, which
includes all good, which is named “every tree,” in which this passage bestows on man the
right to share? for in the universal and transcendent saying every form of good is in harmony
with itself, and the whole is one. And who will keep me back from that tasting of the tree
which is of mixed and doubtful kind? for surely it is clear to all who are at all keen-sighted
what that “every” tree is whose fruit is life, and what again that mixed tree is whose end is
death: for He Who presents ungrudgingly the enjoyment of “every” tree, surely by some
reason and forethought keeps man from participation in those which are of doubtful kind.</p>
<p>4. It seems to me that I may take the great David and the wise Solomon as my instructors
in the interpretation of this text: for both understand the grace of the permitted delight to
be one,—that very actual Good, which in truth is “every” good;—David, when he says,

“Delight thou in the Lord1674,” and Solomon, when he names Wisdom herself (which is the
Lord) “a tree of life1675.”</p>
<p>5. Thus the “every” tree of which the passage gives food to him who was made in the
likeness of God, is the same with the tree of life; and there is opposed to this tree another
tree, the food given by which is the knowledge of good and evil:—not that it bears in turn
as fruit each of these things of opposite significance, but that it produces a fruit blended and
mixed with opposite qualities, the eating of which the Prince of Life forbids, and the serpent
counsels, that he may prepare an entrance for death: and he obtained credence for his
counsel, covering over the fruit with a fair appearance and the show of pleasure, that it might
be pleasant to the eyes and stimulate the desire to taste.</p>

<head>XX. What was the life in Paradise, and what was the forbidden tree1676?</head>
<p>1. What then is that which includes the knowledge of good and evil blended together,
and is decked with the pleasures of sense? I think I am not aiming wide of the mark in employing,
as a starting-point for my speculation, the sense of “knowable1677.” It is not, I think,
“science” which the Scripture here means by “knowledge”; but I find a certain distinction,
according to Scriptural use, between “knowledge” and “discernment”: for to “discern” skilfully
the good from the evil, the Apostle says is a mark of a more perfect condition and of “exercised
senses1678,” for which reason also he bids us “prove all things1679,” and says that
“discernment” belongs to the spiritual man1680: but “knowledge” is not always to be understood
of skill and acquaintance with anything, but of the disposition towards what is
agreeable,—as “the Lord knoweth them that are His1681”; and He says to Moses, “I knew
thee above all1682”; while of those condemned in their wickedness He Who knows all things
says, “I never knew you1683.”</p>
<p>2. The tree, then, from which comes this fruit of mixed knowledge, is among those
things which are forbidden; and that fruit is combined of opposite qualities, which has the
serpent to commend it, it may be for this reason, that the evil is not exposed in its nakedness,
itself appearing in its own proper nature—for wickedness would surely fail of its effect were
it not decked with some fair colour to entice to the desire of it him whom it deceives—but
now the nature of evil is in a manner mixed, keeping destruction like some snare concealed
in its depths, and displaying some phantom of good in the deceitfulness of its exterior. The
beauty of the substance seems good to those who love money: yet “the love of money is a
root of all evil1684”: and who would plunge into the unsavoury mud of wantonness, were it
not that he whom this bait hurries into passion thinks pleasure a thing fair and acceptable?
so, too, the other sins keep their destruction hidden, and seem at first sight acceptable, and
some deceit makes them earnestly sought after by unwary men instead of what is good.</p>

<p>3. Now since the majority of men judge the good to lie in that which gratifies the senses,
and there is a certain identity of name between that which is, and that which appears to be
“good,”—for this reason that desire which arises towards what is evil, as though towards
good, is called by Scripture “the knowledge of good and evil;” “knowledge,” as we have said,
expressing a certain mixed disposition. It speaks of the fruit of the forbidden tree not as a
thing absolutely evil (because it is decked with good), nor as a thing purely good (because
evil is latent in it), but as compounded of both, and declares that the tasting of it brings to
death those who touch it; almost proclaiming aloud the doctrine that the very actual good
is in its nature simple and uniform, alien from all duplicity or conjunction with its opposite,
while evil is many-coloured and fairly adorned, being esteemed to be one thing and revealed
by experience as another, the knowledge of which (that is, its reception by experience) is
the beginning and antecedent of death and destruction.</p>
<p>4. It was because he saw this that the serpent points out the evil fruit of sin, not showing
the evil manifestly in its own nature (for man would not have been deceived by manifest
evil), but giving to what the woman beheld the glamour of a certain beauty, and conjuring
into its taste the spell of a sensual pleasure, he appeared to her to speak convincingly: “and
the woman saw,” it says, “that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the
eyes to behold, and fair to see; and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat1685,” and that
eating became the mother of death to men. This, then, is that fruit-bearing of mixed character,
where the passage clearly expresses the sense in which the tree was called “capable of the
knowledge of good and evil,” because, like the evil nature of poisons that are prepared with
honey, it appears to be good in so far as it affects the senses with sweetness: but in so far as
it destroys him who touches it, it is the worst of all evil. Thus when the evil poison worked
its effect against man’s life, then man, that noble thing and name, the image of God’s nature,
was made, as the prophet says, “like unto vanity1686.”</p>
<p>5. The image, therefore, properly belongs to the better part of our attributes; but all in
our life that is painful and miserable is far removed from the likeness to the Divine.</p>

<head>XXI. That the resurrection is looked for as a consequence, not so much from the declaration
of Scripture as from the very necessity of things1687.</head>
<p>1. Wickedness, however, is not so strong as to prevail over the power of good; nor is the
folly of our nature more powerful and more abiding than the wisdom of God: for it is impossible
that that which is always mutable and variable should be more firm and more
abiding than that which always remains the same and is firmly fixed in goodness: but it is
absolutely certain that the Divine counsel possesses immutability, while the changeableness
of our nature does not remain settled even in evil.</p>
<p>2. Now that which is always in motion, if its progress be to good, will never cease moving
onwards to what lies before it, by reason of the infinity of the course to be traversed:—for
it will not find any limit of its object such that when it has apprehended it, it will at last cease
its motion: but if its bias be in the opposite direction, when it has finished the course of
wickedness and reached the extreme limit of evil, then that which is ever moving, finding
no halting point for its impulse natural to itself when it has run through the lengths that
can be run in wickedness, of necessity turns its motion towards good: for as evil does not
extend to infinity, but is comprehended by necessary limits, it would appear that good once
more follows in succession upon the limit of evil; and thus, as we have said, the ever-moving
character of our nature comes to run its course at the last once more back towards good,
being taught the lesson of prudence by the memory of its former misfortunes, to the end
that it may never again be in like case.</p>
<p>3. Our course, then, will once more lie in what is good, by reason of the fact that the
nature of evil is bounded by necessary limits. For just as those skilled in astronomy tell us
that the whole universe is full of light, and that darkness is made to cast its shadow by the
interposition of the body formed by the earth; and that this darkness is shut off from the
rays of the sun, in the shape of a cone, according to the figure of the sphere-shaped body,
and behind it; while the sun, exceeding the earth by a size many times as great as its own,
enfolding it round about on all sides with its rays, unites at the limit of the cone the concurrent
streams of light; so that if (to suppose the case) any one had the power of passing beyond
the measure to which the shadow extends, he would certainly find himself in light unbroken
by darkness;—even so I think that we ought to understand about ourselves, that on passing
the limit of wickedness we shall again have our conversation in light, as the nature of good,
when compared with the measure of wickedness, is incalculably superabundant.</p>
<p>4. Paradise therefore will be restored, that tree will be restored which is in truth the tree
of life;—there will be restored the grace of the image, and the dignity of rule. It does not
seem to me that our hope is one for those things which are now subjected by God to man
<note type="footnote">1687 Otherwise Chap. xxii. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin version gives as the title:—“That the Divine counsel
is immutable.”</note>

unspeakable mysteries.</p>

<head>XXII. To those who say, “If the resurrection is a thing excellent and good, how is it that it has
not happened already, but is hoped for in some periods of time?”1688</head>
<p>1. Let us give our attention, however, to the next point of our discussion. It may be that
some one, giving his thought wings to soar towards the sweetness of our hope, deems it a
burden and a loss that we are not more speedily placed in that good state which is above
man’s sense and knowledge, and is dissatisfied with the extension of the time that intervenes
between him and the object of his desire. Let him cease to vex himself like a child that is
discontented at the brief delay of something that gives him pleasure; for since all things are
governed by reason and wisdom, we must by no means suppose that anything that happens
is done without reason itself and the wisdom that is therein.</p>
<p>2. You will say then, What is this reason, in accordance with which the change of our
painful life to that which we desire does not take place at once, but this heavy and corporeal
existence of ours waits, extended to some determinate time, for the term of the consummation
of all things, that then man’s life may be set free as it were from the reins, and revert once
more, released and free, to the life of blessedness and impassibility?</p>
<p>3. Well, whether our answer is near the truth of the matter, the Truth Itself may clearly
know; but at all events what occurs to our intelligence is as follows. I take up then once more
in my argument our first text:—God says, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,
and God created man, in the image of God created He him1689.” Accordingly, the Image of
God, which we behold in universal humanity, had its consummation then1690; but Adam
as yet was not; for the thing formed from the earth is called Adam, by etymological nomenclature,
as those tell us who are acquainted with the Hebrew tongue—wherefore also the
apostle, who was specially learned in his native tongue, the tongue of the Israelites, calls the
man “of the earth1691” χοϊκός, as though translating the name Adam into the Greek word.</p>
<p>4. Man, then, was made in the image of God; that is, the universal nature, the thing like
God; not part of the whole, but all the fulness of the nature together was so made by omnipotent
wisdom. He saw, Who holds all limits in His grasp, as the Scripture tells us which
says, “in His hand are all the corners of the earth1692,” He saw, “Who knoweth all things”
even “before they be1693,” comprehending them in His knowledge, how great in number

humanity will be in the sum of its individuals. But as He perceived in our created nature
the bias towards evil, and the fact that after its voluntary fall from equality with the angels
it would acquire a fellowship with the lower nature, He mingled, for this reason, with His
own image, an element of the irrational (for the distinction of male and female does not
exist in the Divine and blessed nature);—transferring, I say, to man the special attribute of
the irrational formation, He bestowed increase upon our race not according to the lofty
character of our creation; for it was not when He made that which was in His own image
that He bestowed on man the power of increasing and multiplying; but when He divided it
by sexual distinctions, then He said, “Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth1694.”
For this belongs not to the Divine, but to the irrational element, as the history indicates
when it narrates that these words were first spoken by God in the case of the irrational
creatures; since we may be sure that, if He had bestowed on man, before imprinting on our
nature the distinction of male and female, the power for increase conveyed by this utterance,
we should not have needed this form of generation by which the brutes are generated.</p>
<p>5. Now seeing that the full number of men pre-conceived by the operation of foreknowledge
will come into life by means of this animal generation, God, Who governs all things
in a certain order and sequence,—since the inclination of our nature to what was beneath
it (which He Who beholds the future equally with the present saw before it existed) made
some such form of generation absolutely necessary for mankind,—therefore also foreknew
the time coextensive with the creation of men, so that the extent of time should be adapted
for the entrances of the pre-determined souls, and that the flux and motion of time should
halt at the moment when humanity is no longer produced by means of it; and that when
the generation of men is completed, time should cease together with its completion, and
then should take place the restitution of all things, and with the World-Reformation humanity
also should be changed from the corruptible and earthly to the impassible and eternal.</p>
<p>6. And this it seems to me the Divine apostle considered when he declared in his epistle
to the Corinthians the sudden stoppage of time, and the change of the things that are now
moving on back to the opposite end where he says, “Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall
not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump1695.” For when, as I suppose, the full complement of human nature has reached the
limit of the pre-determined measure, because there is no longer anything to be made up in
the way of increase to the number of souls, he teaches us that the change in existing things
will take place in an instant of time, giving to that limit of time which has no parts or extension
the names of “a moment,” and “the twinkling of an eye”; so that it will no more be
possible for one who reaches the verge of time (which is the last and extreme point, from
<note type="footnote">1694 Gen. i. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">1695 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52.</note>

the fact that nothing is lacking to the attainment of its extremity) to obtain by death this
change which takes place at a fixed period, but only when the trumpet of the resurrection
sounds, which awakens the dead, and transforms those who are left in life, after the likeness
of those who have undergone the resurrection change, at once to incorruptibility; so that
the weight of the flesh is no longer heavy, nor does its burden hold them down to earth, but
they rise aloft through the air—for, “we shall be caught up,” he tells us, “in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord1696.”</p>
<p>7. Let him therefore wait for that time which is necessarily made co-extensive with the
development of humanity. For even Abraham and the patriarchs, while they had the desire
to see the promised good things, and ceased not to seek the heavenly country, as the apostle
says, are yet even now in the condition of hoping for that grace, “God having provided some
better thing for us,” according to the words of Paul, “that they without us should not be
made perfect1697.” If they, then, bear the delay who by faith only and by hope saw the good
things “afar off” and “embraced them1698,” as the apostle bears witness, placing their certainty
of the enjoyment of the things for which they hoped in the fact that they “judged Him
faithful Who has promised1699,” what ought most of us to do, who have not, it may be, a
hold upon the better hope from the character of our lives? Even the prophet’s soul fainted
with desire, and in his psalm he confesses this passionate love, saying that his “soul hath a
desire and longing to be in the courts of the Lord1700,” even if he must needs be rejected1701
to a place amongst the lowest, as it is a greater and more desirable thing to be last there than
to be first among the ungodly tents of this life; nevertheless he was patient of the delay,
deeming, indeed, the life there blessed, and accounting a brief participation in it more desirable
than “thousands” of time—for he says, “one day in Thy courts is better than thousands1702”—
yet he did not repine at the necessary dispensation concerning existing things,
and thought it sufficient bliss for man to have those good things even by way of hope;
wherefore he says at the end of the Psalm, “O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth
in Thee1703.”</p>
<p>8. Neither, then, should we be troubled at the brief delay of what we hope for, but give
diligence that we may not be cast out from the object of our hopes; for just as though, if one

were to tell some inexperienced person beforehand, “the gathering of the crops will take
place in the season of summer, and the stores will be filled, and the table abundantly supplied
with food at the time of plenty,” it would be a foolish man who should seek to hurry on the
coming of the fruit-time, when he ought to be sowing seeds and preparing the crops for
himself by diligent care; for the fruit-time will surely come, whether he wishes or not, at the
appointed time; and it will be looked on differently by him who has secured for himself beforehand
abundance of crops, and by him who is found by the fruit-time destitute of all
preparation. Even so I think it is one’s duty, as the proclamation is clearly made to all that
the time of change will come, not to trouble himself about times (for He said that “it is not
for us to know the times and the seasons1704”), nor to pursue calculations by which he will
be sure to sap the hope of the resurrection in the soul; but to make his confidence in the
things expected as a prop to lean on, and to purchase for himself, by good conversation, the
grace that is to come.</p>

<head>XXIII. That he who confesses the beginning of the world’s existence must necessarily also agree
as to its end1705.</head>
<p>But if some one, beholding the present course of the world, by which intervals of time
are marked, going on in a certain order, should say that it is not possible that the predicted
stoppage of these moving things should take place, such a man clearly also does not believe
that in the beginning the heaven and the earth were made by God; for he who admits a beginning
of motion surely does not doubt as to its also having an end; and he who does not
allow its end, does not admit its beginning either; but as it is by believing that “we understand
that the worlds were framed by the word of God,” as the apostle says, “so that things which
are seen were not made of things which do appear1706,” we must use the same faith as to
the word of God when He foretells the necessary stoppage of existing things.</p>
<p>2. The question of the “how” must, however, be put beyond the reach of our meddling;
for even in the case mentioned it was “by faith” that we admitted that the thing seen was
framed from things not yet apparent, omitting the search into things beyond our reach.
And yet our reason suggests difficulties on many points, offering no small occasions for
doubt as to the things which we believe.</p>
<p>3. For in that case too, argumentative men might by plausible reasoning upset our faith,
so that we should not think that statement true which Holy Scripture delivers concerning
the material creation, when it asserts that all existing things have their beginning of being
from God. For those who abide by the contrary view maintain that matter is co-eternal with
God, and employ in support of their own doctrine some such arguments as these. If God is
in His nature simple and immaterial, without quantity1707, or size, or combination, and
removed from the idea of circumscription by way of figure, while all matter is apprehended
in extension measured by intervals, and does not escape the apprehension of our senses,
but becomes known to us in colour, and figure, and bulk, and size, and resistance, and the
other attributes belonging to it, none of which it is possible to conceive in the Divine
nature,—what method is there for the production of matter from the immaterial, or of the
nature that has dimensions from that which is unextended? for if these things are believed
to have their existence from that source, they clearly come into existence after being in Him

in some mysterious way; but if material existence was in Him, how can He be immaterial
while including matter in Himself? and similarly with all the other marks by which the
material nature is differentiated; if quantity exists in God, how is God without quantity? if
the compound nature exists in Him, how is He simple, without parts and without combination?
so that the argument forces us to think either that He is material, because matter has
its existence from Him as a source; or, if one avoids this, it is necessary to suppose that
matter was imported by Him ab extra for the making of the universe.</p>
<p>4. If, then, it was external to God, something else surely existed besides God, conceived,
in respect of eternity, together with Him Who exists ungenerately; so that the argument
supposes two eternal and unbegotten existences, having their being concurrently with each
other—that of Him Who operates as an artificer, and that of the thing which admits this
skilled operation; and if any one under pressure of this argument should assume a material
substratum for the Creator of all things, what a support will the Manichæan find for his
special doctrine, who opposes by virtue of ungenerateness a material existence to a Good
Being. Yet we do believe that all things are of God, as we hear the Scripture say so; and as
to the question how they were in God, a question beyond our reason, we do not seek to pry
into it, believing that all things are within the capacity of God’s power—both to give existence
to what is not, and to implant qualities at His pleasure in what is.</p>
<p>5. Consequently, as we suppose the power of the Divine will to be a sufficient cause to
the things that are, for their coming into existence out of nothing, so too we shall not repose
our belief on anything beyond probability in referring the World-Reformation to the same
power. Moreover, it might perhaps be possible, by some skill in the use of words, to persuade
those who raise frivolous objections on the subject of matter not to think that they can make
an unanswerable attack on our statement.</p>

immaterial. For we shall find all matter to be composed of certain qualities, of which if it is
divested it can, in itself, be by no means grasped by idea. Moreover in idea each kind of
quality is separated from the substratum; but idea is an intellectual and not a corporeal
method of examination. If, for instance, some animal or tree is presented to our notice, or
any other of the things that have material existence, we perceive in our mental discussion
of it many things concerning the substratum, the idea of each of which is clearly distinguished
from the object we contemplate: for the idea of colour is one, of weight another; so again
that of quantity and of such and such a peculiar quality of touch: for “softness,” and “two
cubits long,” and the rest of the attributes we spoke of, are not connected in idea either with
one another or with the body: each of them has conceived concerning it its own explanatory
definition according to its being, having nothing in common with any other of the qualities
that are contemplated in the substratum.</p>
<p>2. 1709If, then, colour is a thing intelligible, and resistance also is intelligible, and so with
quantity and the rest of the like properties, while if each of these should be withdrawn from
the substratum, the whole idea of the body is dissolved; it would seem to follow that we may
suppose the concurrence of those things, the absence of which we found to be a cause of
the dissolution of the body, to produce the material nature: for as that is not a body which
has not colour, and figure, and resistance, and extension, and weight, and the other properties,
while each of these in its proper existence is found to be not the body but something else
besides the body, so, conversely, whenever the specified attributes concur they produce
bodily existence. Yet if the perception of these properties is a matter of intellect, and the
Divinity is also intellectual in nature, there is no incongruity in supposing that these intellectual
occasions for the genesis of bodies have their existence from the incorporeal nature,
the intellectual nature on the one hand giving being to the intellectual potentialities, and
the mutual concurrence of these bringing to its genesis the material nature.</p>
<p>3. Let this discussion, however, be by way of digression: we must direct our discourse
once more to the faith by which we accept the statement that the universe took being from
nothing, and do not doubt, when we are taught by Scripture, that it will again be transformed
into some other state.</p>

<head>XXV. How one even of those who are without may be brought to believe the Scripture when
teaching of the resurrection1710.</head>
<p>1. Some one, perhaps, having regard to the dissolution of bodies, and judging the Deity
by the measure of his own power, asserts that the idea of the resurrection is impossible,
saying that it cannot be that both those things which are now in motion should become
stationary, and those things which are now without motion should rise again.</p>
<p>2. Let such an one, however, take as the first and greatest evidence of the truth touching
the resurrection the credibility of the herald who proclaims it. Now the faith of what is said
derives its certainty from the result of the other predictions: for as the Divine Scripture delivers
statements many and various, it is possible by examining how the rest of the utterances
stand in the matter of falsehood and truth to survey also, in the light of them, the doctrine
concerning the resurrection. For if in the other matters the statements are found to be false
and to have failed of true fulfilment, neither is this out of the region of falsehood; but if all
the others have experience to vouch for their truth, it would seem logical to esteem as true,
on their account, the prediction concerning the resurrection also. Let us therefore recall one
or two of the predictions that have been made, and compare the result with what was foretold,
so that we may know by means of them whether the idea has a truthful aspect.</p>
<p>3. Who knows not how the people of Israel flourished of old, raised up against all the
powers of the world; what were the palaces in the city of Jerusalem, what the walls, the
towers, the majestic structure of the Temple? things that seemed worthy of admiration even
to the disciples of the Lord, so that they asked the Lord to take notice of them, in their disposition
to marvel, as the Gospel history shows us, saying, “What works, and what buildings1711!”
But He indicates to those who wondered at its present state the future desolation
of the place and the disappearance of that beauty, saying that after a little while nothing of
what they saw should be left. And, again, at the time of His Passion, the women followed,
bewailing the unjust sentence against Him,—for they could not yet see into the dispensation
of what was being done:—but He bids them be silent as to what is befalling Him, for it does
not demand their tears, but to reserve their wailing and lamentation for the true time for
tears, when the city should be compassed by besiegers, and their sufferings reach so great a
strait that they should deem him happy who had not been born: and herein He foretold also
the horrid deed of her who devoured her child, when He said that in those days the womb
should be accounted blest that never bare1712. Where then are those palaces? where is the
Temple? where are the walls? where are the defences of the towers? where is the power of
<note type="footnote">1710 Otherwise Chap. xxvi. The title in the Bodleian ms. of the Latin version is:—“Of faith in the resurrection,
and of the three dead persons whom the Lord Jesus raised.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1711 Cf. S. Mark xiii. 1</note>
<note type="footnote">1712 Cf. S. Luke xxiii. 27–29.</note>

<pb n="774"/>
the Israelites? were not they scattered in different quarters over almost the whole world?
and in their overthrow the palaces also were brought to ruin.</p>
<p>4. Now it seems to me that the Lord foretold these things and others like them not for
the sake of the matters themselves—for what great advantage to the hearers, at any rate, was
the prediction of what was about to happen? they would have known by experience, even
if they had not previously learnt what would come;—but in order that by these means faith
on their part might follow concerning more important matters: for the testimony of facts
in the former cases is also a proof of truth in the latter.</p>
<p>5. For just as though, if a husbandman were explaining the virtue of seeds, it were to
happen that some person inexperienced in husbandry should disbelieve him, it would be
sufficient as proof of his statement for the agriculturist to show him the virtue existing in
one seed of those in the bushel and make it a pledge of the rest—for he who should see the
single grain of wheat or barley, or whatever might chance to be the contents of the bushel,
grow into an ear after being cast into the ground, would by the means of the one cease also
to disbelieve concerning the others—so the truthfulness which confessedly belongs to the
other statements seems to me to be sufficient also for evidence of the mystery of the resurrection.</p>
<p>6. Still more, however, is this the case with the experience of actual resurrection which
we have learnt not so much by words as by actual facts: for as the marvel of resurrection
was great and passing belief, He begins gradually by inferior instances of His miraculous
power, and accustoms our faith, as it were, for the reception of the greater.</p>
<p>7. For as a mother who nurses her babe with due care for a time supplies milk by her
breast to its mouth while still tender and soft; and when it begins to grow and to have teeth
she gives it bread, not hard or such as it cannot chew, so that the tender and unpractised
gums may not be chafed by rough food; but softening it with her own teeth, she makes it
suitable and convenient for the powers of the eater; and then as its power increases by growth
she gradually leads on the babe, accustomed to tender food, to more solid nourishment; so
the Lord, nourishing and fostering with miracles the weakness of the human mind, like
some babe not fully grown, makes first of all a prelude of the power of the resurrection in
the case of a desperate disease, which prelude, though it was great in its achievement, yet
was not such a thing that the statement of it would be disbelieved: for by “rebuking the
fever” which was fiercely consuming Simon’s wife’s mother, He produced so great a removal
of the evil as to enable her who was already expected to be near death, to “minister1713” to
those present.</p>
<p>8. Next He makes a slight addition to the power, and when the nobleman’s son lies in
acknowledged danger of death (for so the history tells us, that he was about to die, as his
<note type="footnote">1713 S. Luke iv. 39</note>

<pb n="775"/>
father cried, “come down, ere my child die1714”), He again brings about the resurrection of
one who was believed about to die; accomplishing the miracle with a greater act of power
in that He did not even approach the place, but sent life from afar off by the force of His
command.</p>
<p>9. Once more in what follows He ascends to higher wonders. For having set out on His
way to the ruler of the synagogue’s daughter, he voluntarily made a halt in His way, while
making public the secret cure of the woman with an issue of blood, that in this time death
might overcome the sick. When, then, the soul had just been parted from the body, and
those who were wailing over the sorrow were making a tumult with their mournful cries,
He raises the damsel to life again, as if from sleep, by His word of command, leading on
human weakness, by a sort of path and sequence, to greater things.</p>
<p>10. Still in addition to these acts He exceeds them in wonder, and by a more exalted act
of power prepares for men the way of faith in the resurrection. The Scripture tells us of a
city called Nain in Judæa: a widow there had an only child, no longer a child in the sense of
being among boys, but already passing from childhood to man’s estate: the narrative calls
him “a young man.” The story conveys much in few words: the very recital is a real lamentation:
the dead man’s mother, it says, “was a widow.” See you the weight of her misfortune,
how the text briefly sets out the tragedy of her suffering? for what does the phrase mean?
that she had no more hope of bearing sons, to cure the loss she had just sustained in him
who had departed; for the woman was a widow: she had not in her power to look to another
instead of to him who was gone; for he was her only child; and how great a grief is here expressed
any one may easily see who is not an utter stranger to natural feeling. Him alone
she had known in travail, him alone she had nursed at her breast; he alone made her table
cheerful, he alone was the cause of brightness in her home, in play, in work, in learning, in
gaiety, at processions, at sports, at gatherings of youth; he alone was all that is sweet and
precious in a mother’s eyes. Now at the age of marriage, he was the stock of her race, the
shoot of its succession, the staff of her old age. Moreover, even the additional detail of his
time of life is another lament: for he who speaks of him as “a young man” tells of the flower
of his faded beauty, speaks of him as just covering his face with down, not yet with a full
thick beard, but still bright with the beauty of his cheeks. What then, think you, were his
mother’s sorrows for him? how would her heart be consumed as it were with a flame; how
bitterly would she prolong her lament over him, embracing the corpse as it lay before her,
lengthening out her mourning for him as far as possible, so as not to hasten the funeral of
the dead, but to have her fill of sorrow! Nor does the narrative pass this by: for Jesus “when
He saw her,” it says, “had compassion”; “and He came and touched the bier; and they that
bare him stood still;” and He said to the dead, “Young man, I say unto thee, arise1715,” “and
<note type="footnote">1714 S. John iv. 49</note>
<note type="footnote">1715 Cf. S. Luke vii. 13–15.</note>

<pb n="776"/>
He delivered him to his mother” alive. Observe that no short time had intervened since the
dead man had entered upon that state, he was all but laid in the tomb; the miracle wrought
by the Lord is greater, though the command is the same.</p>
<p>11. His miraculous power proceeds to a still more exalted act, that its display may more
closely approach that miracle of the resurrection which men doubt. One of the Lord’s
companions and friends is ill (Lazarus is the sick man’s name); and the Lord deprecates any
visiting of His friend, though far away from the sick man, that in the absence of the Life,
death might find room and power to do his own work by the agency of disease. The Lord
informs His disciples in Galilee of what has befallen Lazarus, and also of his own setting out
to him to raise him up when laid low. They, however, were exceedingly afraid on account
of the fury of the Jews, thinking it a difficult and dangerous matter to turn again towards
Judæa, in the midst of those who sought to slay Him: and thus, lingering and delaying, they
return slowly from Galilee: but they do return, for His command prevailed, and the disciples
were led by the Lord to be initiated at Bethany in the preliminary mysteries of the general
resurrection. Four days had already passed since the event; all due rites had been performed
for the departed; the body was hidden in the tomb: it was probably already swollen and beginning
to dissolve into corruption, as the body mouldered in the dank earth and necessarily
decayed: the thing was one to turn from, as the dissolved body under the constraint of nature
changed to offensiveness1716. At this point the doubted fact of the general resurrection is
brought to proof by a more manifest miracle; for one is not raised from severe sickness, nor
brought back to life when at the last breath—nor is a child just dead brought to life, nor a
young man about to be conveyed to the tomb released from his bier; but a man past the
prime of life, a corpse, decaying, swollen, yea already in a state of dissolution, so that even
his own kinsfolk could not suffer that the Lord should draw near the tomb by reason of the
offensiveness of the decayed body there enclosed, brought into life by a single call, confirms
the proclamation of the resurrection, that is to say, that expectation of it as universal, which
we learn by a particular experience to entertain. For as in the regeneration of the universe
the Apostle tells us that “the Lord Himself will descend with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel1717,” and by a trumpet sound raise up the dead to incorruption—so now too he
who is in the tomb, at the voice of command, shakes off death as if it were a sleep, and ridding
himself from the corruption that had come upon his condition of a corpse, leaps forth from
the tomb whole and sound, not even hindered in his egress by the bonds of the grave-cloths
round his feet and hands.</p>
<note type="footnote">1716 Omitting, as several of Forbes’ mss. do, and as the ms. employed by Dionysius seems to have done, the
words ἀποδίδοναι πάλιν τῷ ζῆν. If these words are retained, βιαζομένης must be taken passively, and the πρᾶγμα
φευκτόν understood not of the condition of the corpse, but of the resurrection of Lazarus.</note>

<p>12. Are these things too small to produce faith in the resurrection of the dead? or dost
thou seek that thy judgment on this point should be confirmed by yet other proofs? In truth
the Lord seems to me not to have spoken in vain to them of Capernaum, when He said to
Himself, as in the person of men, “Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal
thyself1718.’” For it behoved Him, when He had accustomed men to the miracle of the resurrection
in other bodies, to confirm His word in His own humanity. Thou sawest the thing
proclaimed working in others—those who were about to die, the child which had just ceased
to live, the young man at the edge of the grave, the putrefying corpse, all alike restored by
one command to life. Dost thou seek for those who have come to death by wounds and
bloodshed? does any feebleness of life-giving power hinder the grace in them? Behold Him
Whose hands were pierced with nails: behold Him Whose side was transfixed with a spear;
pass thy fingers through the print of the nails; thrust thy hand into the spear-wound1719;
thou canst surely guess how far within it is likely the point would reach, if thou reckonest
the passage inwards by the breadth of the external scar; for the wound that gives admission
to a man’s hand, shows to what depth within the iron entered. If He then has been raised,
well may we utter the Apostle’s exclamation, “How say some that there is no resurrection
of the dead1720?”</p>
<p>13. Since, then, every prediction of the Lord is shown to be true by the testimony of
events, while we not only have learnt this by His words, but also received the proof of the
promise in deed, from those very persons who returned to life by resurrection, what occasion
is left to those who disbelieve? Shall we not bid farewell to those who pervert our simple
faith by “philosophy and vain deceit1721,” and hold fast to our confession in its purity,
learning briefly through the prophet the mode of the grace, by his words, “Thou shalt take
away their breath and they shall fail, and turn to their dust. Thou shalt send forth Thy
Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth1722;” at which
time also he says that the Lord rejoices in His works, sinners having perished from the earth:
for how shall any one be called by the name of sin, when sin itself exists no longer?</p>

<head>XXVI. That the resurrection is not beyond probability1723.</head>
<p>1. There are, however, some who, owing to the feebleness of human reasoning, judging
the Divine power by the compass of our own, maintain that what is beyond our capacity is
not possible even to God. They point to the disappearance of the dead of old time, and to
the remains of those who have been reduced to ashes by fire; and further, besides these, they
bring forward in idea the carnivorous beasts, and the fish that receives in its own body the
flesh of the shipwrecked sailor, while this again in turn becomes food for men, and passes
by digestion into the bulk of him who eats it: and they rehearse many such trivialities, unworthy
of God’s great power and authority, for the overthrow of the doctrine, arguing as
though God were not able to restore to man his own, by return1724 through the same ways.</p>
<p>2. But we briefly cut short their long circuits of logical folly by acknowledging that dissolution
of the body into its component parts does take place, and not only does earth, according
to the Divine word, return to earth, but air and moisture also revert to the kindred
element, and there takes place a return of each of our components to that nature to which
it is allied; and although the human body be dispersed among carnivorous birds, or among
the most savage beasts by becoming their food, and although it pass beneath the teeth of
fish, and although it be changed by fire into vapour and dust, wheresoever one may in argument
suppose the man to be removed, he surely remains in the world; and the world, the
voice of inspiration tells us, is held by the hand of God. If thou, then, art not ignorant of
any of the things in thy hand, dost thou deem the knowledge of God to be feebler than thine
own power, that it should fail to discover the most minute of the things that are within the
compass of the Divine span?</p>

<head>XXVII. That it is possible, when the human body is dissolved into the elements of the universe,
that each should have his own body restored from the common source1725.</head>
<p>1. Yet it may be thou thinkest, having regard to the elements of the universe, that it is
a hard thing when the air in us has been resolved into its kindred element, and the warmth,
and moisture, and the earthy nature have likewise been mingled with their own kind, that
from the common source there should return to the individual what belongs to itself.</p>
<p>2. Dost thou not then judge by human examples that even this does not surpass the
limits of the Divine power? Thou hast seen surely somewhere among the habitations of men
a common herd of some kind of animals collected from every quarter: yet when it is again
divided among its owners, acquaintance with their homes and the marks put upon the cattle
serve to restore to each his own. If thou conceivest of thyself also something like to this,
thou wilt not be far from the right way: for as the soul is disposed to cling to and long for
the body that has been wedded to it, there also attaches to it in secret a certain close relationship
and power of recognition, in virtue of their commixture, as though some marks had
been imprinted by nature, by the aid of which the community remains unconfused, separated
by the distinctive signs. Now as the soul attracts again to itself that which is its own and
properly belongs to it, what labour, I pray you, that is involved for the Divine power, could
be a hindrance to concourse of kindred things when they are urged to their own place by
the unspeakable attraction of nature, whatever it may be? For that some signs of our compound
nature remain in the soul even after dissolution is shown by the dialogue in Hades1726,
where the bodies had been conveyed to the tomb, but some bodily token still remained in
the souls by which both Lazarus was recognized and the rich man was not unknown.</p>
<p>3. There is therefore nothing beyond probability in believing that in the bodies that rise
again there will be a return from the common stock to the individual, especially for any one
who examines our nature with careful attention. For neither does our being consist altogether
in flux and change—for surely that which had by nature no stability would be absolutely
incomprehensible—but according to the more accurate statement some one of our constituent
parts is stationary while the rest goes through a process of alteration: for the body is on
the one hand altered by way of growth and diminution, changing, like garments, the vesture
of its successive statures, while the form, on the other hand, remains in itself unaltered
through every change, not varying from the marks once imposed upon it by nature, but
appearing with its own tokens of identity in all the changes which the body undergoes.</p>
<p>4. We must except, however, from this statement the change which happens to the form
as the result of disease: for the deformity of sickness takes possession of the form like some
<note type="footnote">1725 Otherwise Chap. xxviii. The title in the Bodleian ms. of the Latin version is:—“That although bodies
rise together they will yet receive their own souls.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1726 Cf. S. Luke xvi. 24–31.</note>

<pb n="780"/>
strange mask, and when this is removed by the word1727, as in the case of Naaman the Syrian,
or of those whose story is recorded in the Gospel, the form that had been hidden by
disease is once more by means of health restored to sight again with its own marks of identity.</p>
<p>5. Now to the element of our soul which is in the likeness of God it is not that which is
subject to flux and change by way of alteration, but this stable and unalterable element in
our composition that is allied: and since various differences of combination produce varieties
of forms (and combination is nothing else than the mixture of the elements—by elements
we mean those which furnish the substratum for the making of the universe, of which the
human body also is composed), while the form necessarily remains in the soul as in the
impression of a seal, those things which have received from the seal the impression of its
stamp do not fail to be recognized by the soul, but at the time of the World-Reformation,
it receives back to itself all those things which correspond to the stamp of the form: and
surely all those things would so correspond which in the beginning were stamped by the
form; thus it is not beyond probability that what properly belongs to the individual should
once more return to it from the common source1728.</p>
<p>6. It is said also that quicksilver, if poured out from the vessel that contains it down a
dusty slope, forms small globules and scatters itself over the ground, mingling with none of
those bodies with which it meets: but if one should collect at one place the substance dispersed
in many directions, it flows back to its kindred substance, if not hindered by anything intervening
from mixing with its own kind. Something of the same sort, I think, we ought to
understand also of the composite nature of man, that if only the power were given it of God,
the proper parts would spontaneously unite with those belonging to them, without any obstruction
on their account arising to Him Who reforms their nature.</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, in the case of plants that grow from the ground, we do not observe any
labour on the part of nature spent on the wheat or millet or any other seed of grain or pulse,
in changing it into stalk or spike or ears; for the proper nourishment passes spontaneously,
without trouble, from the common source to the individuality of each of the seeds. If, then,
while the moisture supplied to all the plants is common, each of those plants which is
nourished by it draws the due supply for its own growth, what new thing is it if in the doctrine
of the resurrection also, as in the case of the seeds, it happens that there is an attraction on
the part of each of those who rise, of what belongs to himself?</p>
<note type="footnote">1727 The word, that is of the Prophet, or of the Saviour, as in the cases cited.</note>
<note type="footnote">1728 The “form” seems to be regarded as a seal, which, while taking its pattern from the combination of elements,
yet marks those elements which have been grouped together under it; and which at the same time leaves
an impression of itself upon the soul. The soul is thus enabled to recognize the elemental particles which make
up that body which belonged to it, by the τύπος imprinted on them as well as on itself.</note>

<pb n="781"/>
<p>8. So that we may learn on all hands, that the preaching of the resurrection contains
nothing beyond those facts which are known to us experimentally.</p>
<p>9. And yet we have said nothing of the most notable point concerning ourselves; I mean
the first beginning of our existence. Who knows not the miracle of nature, what the maternal
womb receives—what it produces? Thou seest how that which is implanted in the womb to
be the beginning of the formation of the body is in a manner simple and homogeneous: but
what language can express the variety of the composite body that is framed? and who, if he
did not learn such a thing in nature generally, would think that to be possible which does
take place—that that small thing of no account is the beginning of a thing so great? Great,
I say, not only with regard to the bodily formation, but to what is more marvellous than
this, I mean the soul itself, and the attributes we behold in it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28"> 
<pb n="782"/>
<head>XXVIII. To those who say that souls existed before bodies, or that bodies were formed before
souls; wherein there is also a refutation of the fables concerning transmigration of souls1729.</head>
<p>1. For it is perhaps not beyond our present subject to discuss the question which has
been raised in the churches touching soul and body. Some of those before our time who
have dealt with the question of “principles” think it right to say that souls have a previous
existence as a people in a society of their own, and that among them also there are standards
of vice and of virtue, and that the soul there, which abides in goodness, remains without
experience of conjunction with the body; but if it does depart from its communion with
good, it falls down to this lower life, and so comes to be in a body. Others, on the contrary,
marking the order of the making of man as stated by Moses, say, that the soul is second to
the body in order of time, since God first took dust from the earth and formed man, and
then animated the being thus formed by His breath1730: and by this argument they prove
that the flesh is more noble than the soul; that which was previously formed than that which
was afterwards infused into it: for they say that the soul was made for the body, that the
thing formed might not be without breath and motion; and that everything that is made for
something else is surely less precious than that for which it is made, as the Gospel tells us
that “the soul is more than meat and the body than raiment1731,” because the latter things
exist for the sake of the former—for the soul was not made for meat nor our bodies for
raiment, but when the former things were already in being the latter were provided for their
needs.</p>
<p>2. Since then the doctrine involved in both these theories is open to criticism—the
doctrine alike of those who ascribe to souls a fabulous pre-existence in a special state, and
of those who think they were created at a later time than the bodies, it is perhaps necessary
to leave none of the statements contained in the doctrines without examination: yet to engage
and wrestle with the doctrines on each side completely, and to reveal all the absurdities involved
in the theories, would need a large expenditure both of argument and of time; we
shall, however, briefly survey as best we can each of the views mentioned, and then resume
our subject.</p>
<p>3. Those who stand by the former doctrine, and assert that the state of souls is prior to
their life in the flesh, do not seem to me to be clear from the fabulous doctrines of the heathen
which they hold on the subject of successive incorporation: for if one should search carefully,
he will find that their doctrine is of necessity brought down to this. They tell us that one of
their sages said that he, being one and the same person, was born a man, and afterwards

origin of the soul.”</note>

assumed the form of a woman, and flew about with the birds, and grew as a bush, and obtained
the life of an aquatic creature;—and he who said these things of himself did not, so
far as I can judge, go far from the truth: for such doctrines as this of saying that one soul
passed through so many changes are really fitting for the chatter of frogs or jackdaws, or
the stupidity of fishes, or the insensibility of trees.</p>
<p>4. And of such absurdity the cause is this—the supposition of the pre-existence of souls
for the first principle of such doctrine leads on the argument by consequence to the next
and adjacent stage, until it astonishes us by reaching this point. For if the soul, being severed
from the more exalted state by some wickedness after having once, as they say, tasted corporeal
life, again becomes a man, and if the life in the flesh is, as may be presumed, acknowledged
to be, in comparison with the eternal and incorporeal life, more subject to passion,
it naturally follows that that which comes to be in a life such as to contain more occasions
of sin, is both placed in a region of greater wickedness and rendered more subject to passion
than before (now passion in the human soul is a conformity to the likeness of the irrational);
and that being brought into close connection with this, it descends to the brute nature: and
that when it has once set out on its way through wickedness, it does not cease its advance
towards evil even when found in an irrational condition: for a halt in evil is the beginning
of the impulse towards virtue, and in irrational creatures virtue does not exist. Thus it will
of necessity be continually changed for the worse, always proceeding to what is more degraded
and always finding out what is worse than the nature in which it is: and just as the
sensible nature is lower than the rational, so too there is a descent from this to the insensible.</p>
<p>5. Now so far in its course their doctrine, even if it does overstep the bounds of truth,
at all events derives one absurdity from another by a kind of logical sequence: but from this
point onwards their teaching takes the form of incoherent fable. Strict inference points to
the complete destruction of the soul; for that which has once fallen from the exalted state
will be unable to halt at any measure of wickedness, but will pass by means of its relation
with the passions from rational to irrational, and from the latter state will be transferred to
the insensibility of plants; and on the insensible there borders, so to say, the inanimate; and
on this again follows the non-existent, so that absolutely by this train of reasoning they will
have the soul to pass into nothing: thus a return once more to the better state is impossible
for it: and yet they make the soul return from a bush to the man: they therefore prove that
the life in a bush is more precious than an incorporeal state1732.</p>
<p>6. It has been shown that the process of deterioration which takes place in the soul will
probably be extended downwards; and lower than the insensible we find the inanimate, to
which, by consequence, the principle of their doctrine brings the soul: but as they will not
have this, they either exclude the soul from insensibility, or, if they are to bring it back to
<note type="footnote">1732 That is, the life of the spirit before its incorporation.</note>

<pb n="784"/>
human life, they must, as has been said, declare the life of a tree to be preferable to the original
state—if, that is, the fall towards vice took place from the one, and the return towards
virtue takes place from the other.</p>
<p>7. Thus this doctrine of theirs, which maintains that souls have a life by themselves before
their life in the flesh, and that they are by reason of wickedness bound to their bodies, is
shown to have neither beginning nor conclusion: and as for those who assert that the soul
is of later creation than the body, their absurdity was already demonstrated above1733.</p>
<p>8. The doctrine of both, then, is equally to be rejected; but I think that we ought to direct
our own doctrine in the way of truth between these theories: and this doctrine is that we
are not to suppose, according to the error of the heathen that the souls that revolve with the
motion of the universe weighed down by some wickedness, fall to earth by inability to keep
up with the swiftness of the motion of the spheres.</p>

<head>XXIX. An establishment of the doctrine that the cause of the existence of soul and body is one
and the same.1734</head>
<p>1. Nor again are we in our doctrine to begin by making up man like a clay figure, and
to say that the soul came into being for the sake of this; for surely in that case the intellectual
nature would be shown to be less precious than the clay figure. But as man is one, the being
consisting of soul and body, we are to suppose that the beginning of his existence is one,
common to both parts, so that he should not be found to be antecedent and posterior to
himself, if the bodily element were first in point of time, and the other were a later addition;
but we are to say that in the power of God’s foreknowledge (according to the doctrine laid
down a little earlier in our discourse), all the fulness of human nature had pre-existence
(and to this the prophetic writing bears witness, which says that God “knoweth all things
before they be1735”), and in the creation of individuals not to place the one element before
the other, neither the soul before the body, nor the contrary, that man may not be at strife
against himself, by being divided by the difference in point of time.</p>
<p>2. For as our nature is conceived as twofold, according to the apostolic teaching, made
up of the visible man and the hidden man, if the one came first and the other supervened,
the power of Him that made us will be shown to be in some way imperfect, as not being
completely sufficient for the whole task at once, but dividing the work, and busying itself
with each of the halves in turn.</p>
<p>3. But just as we say that in wheat, or in any other grain, the whole form of the plant is
potentially included—the leaves, the stalk, the joints, the grain, the beard—and do not say
in our account of its nature that any of these things has pre-existence, or comes into being
before the others, but that the power abiding in the seed is manifested in a certain natural
order, not by any means that another nature is infused into it—in the same way we suppose
the human germ to possess the potentiality of its nature, sown with it at the first start of its
existence, and that it is unfolded and manifested by a natural sequence as it proceeds to its
perfect state, not employing anything external to itself as a stepping-stone to perfection, but
itself advancing its own self in due course to the perfect state; so that it is not true to say
either that the soul exists before the body, or that the body exists without the soul, but that
there is one beginning of both, which according to the heavenly view was laid as their
foundation in the original will of God; according to the other, came into existence on the
occasion of generation.</p>
<note type="footnote">1734 Otherwise Chap. xxx. But in the Latin translation of Dionysius, the new chapter does not begin till the
end of the first sentence of the Greek text. As Forbes remarks, either place is awkward: a better beginning would
be found at §8 of the preceding chapter. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin version gives as the title:—“That God
equally made the soul and the body of man.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1735 Hist. Sus. 42.</note>

<pb n="786"/>
<p>4. For as we cannot discern the articulation of the limbs in that which is implanted for
the conception of the body before it begins to take form, so neither is it possible to perceive
in the same the properties of the soul before they advance to operation; and just as no one
would doubt that the thing so implanted is fashioned into the different varieties of limbs
and interior organs, not by the importation of any other power from without, but by the
power which resides in it transforming1736 it to this manifestation of energy,—so also we
may by like reasoning equally suppose in the case of the soul that even if it is not visibly recognized
by any manifestations of activity it none the less is there; for even the form of the
future man is there potentially, but is concealed because it is not possible that it should be
made visible before the necessary sequence of events allows it; so also the soul is there, even
though it is not visible, and will be manifested by means of its own proper and natural operation,
as it advances concurrently with the bodily growth.</p>
<p>5. For since it is not from a dead body that the potentiality for conception is secreted,
but from one which is animate and alive, we hence affirm that it is reasonable that we should
not suppose that what is sent forth from a living body to be the occasion of life is itself dead
and inanimate; for in the flesh that which is inanimate is surely dead; and the condition of
death arises by the withdrawal of the soul. Would not one therefore in this case be asserting
that withdrawal is antecedent to possession—if, that is, he should maintain that the inanimate
state which is the condition of death is antecedent to the soul1737? And if any one should
seek for a still clearer evidence of the life of that particle which becomes the beginning of
the living creature in its formation, it is possible to obtain an idea on this point from other
signs also, by which what is animate is distinguished from what is dead. For in the case of
men we consider it an evidence of life that one is warm and operative and in motion, but
the chill and motionless state in the case of bodies is nothing else than deadness.</p>
<p>6. Since then we see that of which we are speaking to be warm and operative, we thereby
draw the further inference that it is not inanimate; but as, in respect of its corporeal part,
we do not say that it is flesh, and bones, and hair, and all that we observe in the human being,
but that potentially it is each of these things, yet does not visibly appear to be so; so also of
the part which belongs to the soul, the elements of rationality, and desire, and anger, and
all the powers of the soul are not yet visible; yet we assert that they have their place in it,
and that the energies of the soul also grow with the subject in a manner similar to the
formation and perfection of the body.</p>
<p>7. For just as a man when perfectly developed has a specially marked activity of the soul,
so at the beginning of his existence he shows in himself that co-operation of the soul which
<note type="footnote">1736 The reading αὐτῆς μεθισταμένης, “itself being transformed,” seems to give a better sense, but the weight
of ms. authority seems to be against it.</note>
<note type="footnote">1737 Altering Forbes’ punctuation.</note>

<pb n="787"/>
is suitable and conformable to his existing need, in its preparing for itself its proper dwellingplace
by means of the implanted matter; for we do not suppose it possible that the soul is
adapted to a strange building, just as it is not possible that the seal impressed on wax should
be fitted to an engraving that does not agree with it.</p>
<p>8. For as the body proceeds from a very small original to the perfect state, so also the
operation of the soul, growing in correspondence with the subject, gains and increases with
it. For at its first formation there comes first of all its power of growth and nutriment alone,
as though it were some root buried in the ground; for the limited nature of the recipient
does not admit of more; then, as the plant comes forth to the light and shows its shoot to
the sun, the gift of sensibility blossoms in addition, but when at last it is ripened and has
grown up to its proper height, the power of reason begins to shine forth like a fruit, not appearing
in its whole vigour all at once, but by care increasing with the perfection of the instrument,
bearing always as much fruit as the powers of the subject allow.</p>
<p>9. If, however, thou seekest to trace the operation of the soul in the formation of the
body, “take heed to thyself1738,” as Moses says, and thou wilt read, as in a book, the history
of the works of the soul; for nature itself expounds to thee, more clearly than any discourse,
the varied occupations of the soul in the body, alike in general and in particular acts of
construction.</p>
<p>10. But I deem it superfluous to declare at length in words what is to be found in
ourselves, as though we were expounding some wonder that lay beyond our boundaries:—
who that looks on himself needs words to teach him his own nature? For it is possible
for one who considers the mode of his own life, and learns how closely concerned the body
is in every vital operation, to know in what the vegetative1739 principle of the soul was occupied
on the occasion of the first formation of that which was beginning its existence; so that
hereby also it is clear to those who have given any attention to the matter, that the thing
which was implanted by separation from the living body for the production of the living
being was not a thing dead or inanimate in the laboratory of nature.</p>
<p>11. Moreover we plant in the ground the kernels of fruits, and portions torn from roots,
not deprived by death of the vital power which naturally resides in them, but preserving in
themselves, hidden indeed, yet surely living, the property of their prototype; the earth that
surrounds them does not implant such a power from without, infusing it from itself (for
surely then even dead wood would proceed to growth), but it makes that manifest which
resides in them, nourishing it by its own moisture, perfecting the plant into root, and bark,
and pith, and shoots of branches, which could not happen were not a natural power implanted

<head>XXX. A brief examination of the construction of our bodies from a medical point of view.1740</head>
<p>1. Now the exact structure of our body each man teaches himself by his experiences of
sight and light and perception, having his own nature to instruct him; any one too may learn
everything accurately who takes up the researches which those skilled in such matters have
worked out in books. And of these writers some learnt by dissection the position of our individual
organs; others also considered and expounded the reason for the existence of all
the parts of the body; so that the knowledge of the human frame which hence results is
sufficient for students. But if any one further seeks that the Church should be his teacher
on all these points, so that he may not need for anything the voice of those without (for this
is the wont of the spiritual sheep, as the Lord says, that they hear not a strange voice1741),
we shall briefly take in hand the account of these matters also.</p>
<p>2. We note concerning our bodily nature three things, for the sake of which our particular
parts were formed. Life is the cause of some, good life of others, others again are adapted
with a view to the succession of descendants. All things in us which are of such a kind that
without them it is not possible that human life should exist, we consider as being in three
parts; in the brain, the heart, and the liver. Again, all that are a sort of additional blessings,
nature’s liberality, whereby she bestows on man the gift of living well, are the organs of
sense; for such things do not constitute our life, since even where some of them are wanting
man is often none the less in a condition of life; but without these forms of activity it is impossible
to enjoy participation in the pleasures of life. The third aim regards the future, and
the succession of life. There are also certain other organs besides these, which help, in
common with all the others, to subserve the continuance of life, importing by their own
means the proper supplies, as the stomach and the lungs, the latter fanning by respiration
the fire at the heart, the former introducing the nourishment for the internal organs.</p>
<p>3. Our structure, then, being thus divided, we have carefully to mark that our faculty
for life is not supported in any one way by some single organ, but nature, while distributing
the means for our existence among several parts, makes the contribution of each individual
necessary for the whole; just as the things which nature contrives for the security and beauty
of life are also numerous, and differ much among themselves.</p>
<p>4. We ought, however, I think, first to discuss briefly the first beginnings of the things
which contribute to the constitution of our life. As for the material of the whole body which
serves as a common substratum for the particular members, it may for the present be left
without remark; for a discussion as to natural substance in general will not be of any assistance
to our purpose with regard to the consideration of the parts.</p>
<note type="footnote">1740 Otherwise Chap. xxxi. The Bodleian ms. of the Latin version gives the title:—“Of the threefold nature
of the body.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1741 Cf. S. John x. 5</note>

<pb n="790"/>
<p>5. As it is then acknowledged by all that there is in us a share of all that we behold as
elements in the universe—of heat and cold, and of the other pair of qualities of moisture
and dryness—we must discuss them severally.</p>
<p>6. We see then that the powers which control life are three, of which the first by its heat
produces general warmth, the second by its moisture keeps damp that which is warmed, so
that the living being is kept in an intermediate condition by the equal balance of the forces
exerted by the quality of each of the opposing natures (the moist element not being dried
up by excess of heat, nor the hot element quenched by the prevalence of moisture); and the
third power by its own agency holds together the separate members in a certain agreement
and harmony, connecting them by the ties which it itself furnishes, and sending into them
all that self-moving and determining force, on the failure of which the member becomes
relaxed and deadened, being left destitute of the determining spirit.</p>
<p>7. Or rather, before dealing with these, it is right that we should mark the skilled workmanship
of nature in the actual construction of the body. For as that which is hard and
resistent does not admit the action of the senses (as we may see in the instance of our own
bones, and in that of plants in the ground, where we remark indeed a certain form of life in
that they grow and receive nourishment, yet the resistent character of their substance does
not allow them sensation), for this reason it was necessary that some wax-like formation,
so to say, should be supplied for the action of the senses, with the faculty of being impressed
with the stamp of things capable of striking them, neither becoming confused by excess of
moisture (for the impress would not remain in moist substance), nor resisting by extraordinary
solidity (for that which is unyielding would not receive any mark from the impressions),
but being in a state between softness and hardness, in order that the living being might not
be destitute of the fairest of all the operations of nature—I mean the motion of sense.</p>
<p>8. Now as a soft and yielding substance, if it had no assistance from the hard parts, would
certainly have, like molluscs, neither motion nor articulation, nature accordingly mingles
in the body the hardness of the bones, and uniting these by close connection one to another,
and knitting their joints together by means of the sinews, thus plants around them the flesh
which receives sensations, furnished with a somewhat harder and more highly-strung surface
than it would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>9. While resting, then, the whole weight of the body on this substance of the bones, as
on some columns that carry a mass of building, she did not implant the bone undivided
through the whole structure: for in that case man would have remained without motion or
activity, if he had been so constructed, just like a tree that stands on one spot without either
the alternate motion of legs to advance its motion or the service of hands to minister to the
conveniences of life: but now we see that she contrived that the instrument should be
rendered capable of walking and working by this device, after she had implanted in the
body, by the determining spirit which extends through the nerves, the impulse and power

<pb n="791"/>
for motion. And hence is produced the service of the hands, so varied and multiform, and
answering to every thought. Hence are produced, as though by some mechanical contrivance,
the turnings of the neck, and the bending and raising of the head, and the action of the chin,
and the separation of the eyelids, that takes place with a thought, and the movements of the
other joints, by the tightening or relaxation of certain nerves. And the power that extends
through these exhibits a sort of independent impulse, working with the spirit of its will by
a sort of natural management, in each particular part; but the root of all, and the principle
of the motions of the nerves, is found in the nervous tissue that surrounds the brain.</p>
<p>10. We consider, then, that we need not spend more time in inquiring in which of the
vital members such a thing resides, when the energy of motion is shown to be here. But that
the brain contributes to life in a special degree is shown clearly by the result of the opposite
conditions: for if the tissue surrounding it receives any wound or lesion, death immediately
follows the injury, nature being unable to endure the hurt even for a moment; just as, when
a foundation is withdrawn, the whole building collapses with the part; and that member,
from an injury to which the destruction of the whole living being clearly follows, may
properly be acknowledged to contain the cause of life.</p>
<p>11. But as furthermore in those who have ceased to live, when the heat that is implanted
in our nature is quenched, that which has become dead grows cold, we hence recognize the
vital cause also in heat: for we must of necessity acknowledge that the living being subsists
by the presence of that, which failing, the condition of death supervenes. And of such a force
we understand the heart to be as it were the fountain-head and principle, as from it pipelike
passages, growing one from another in many ramifications, diffuse in the whole body
the warm and fiery spirit.</p>
<p>12. And since some nourishment must needs also be provided by nature for the element
of heat—for it is not possible that the fire should last by itself, without being nourished by
its proper food—therefore the channels of the blood, issuing from the liver as from a fountainhead,
accompany the warm spirit everywhere in its way throughout the body, that the
one may not by isolation from the other become a disease and destroy the constitution. Let
this instruct those who go beyond the bounds of fairness, as they learn from nature that
covetousness is a disease that breeds destruction.</p>
<p>13. But since the Divinity alone is free from needs, while human poverty requires external
aid for its own subsistence, nature therefore, in addition to those three powers by which we
said that the whole body is regulated, brings in imported matter from without, introducing
by different entrances that which is suitable to those powers.</p>
<p>14. For to the fount of the blood, which is the liver, she furnishes its supply by food: for
that which from time to time is imported in this way prepares the springs of blood to issue
from the liver, as the snow on the mountain by its own moisture increases the springs in
the low ground, forcing its own fluid deep down to the veins below.</p>

<pb n="792"/>
<p>15. The breath in the heart is supplied by means of the neighbouring organ, which is
called the lungs, and is a receptacle for air, drawing the breath from without through the
windpipe inserted in it, which extends to the mouth. The heart being placed in the midst of
this organ (and itself also moving incessantly in imitation of the action of the ever-moving
fire), draws to itself, somewhat as the bellows do in the forges, a supply from the adjacent
air, filling its recesses by dilatation, and while it fans its own fiery element, breathes upon
the adjoining tubes; and this it does not cease to do, drawing the external air into its own
recesses by dilatation, and by compression infusing the air from itself into the tubes.</p>
<p>16. And this seems to me to be the cause of this spontaneous respiration of ours; for
often the mind is occupied in discourse with others, or is entirely quiescent when the body
is relaxed in sleep, but the respiration of air does not cease, though the will gives no co-operation
to this end. Now I suppose, since the heart is surrounded by the lungs, and in the
back part of its own structure is attached to them, moving that organ by its own dilatations
and compressions, that the inhaling and exhaling1742 of the air is brought about by the
lungs: for as they are a lightly built and porous body, and have all their recesses opening at
the base of the windpipe, when they contract and are compressed they necessarily force out
by pressure the air that is left in their cavities; and, when they expand and open, draw the
air, by their distention, into the void by suction.</p>
<p>17. This then is the cause of this involuntary respiration—the impossibility that the fiery
element should remain at rest: for as the operation of motion is proper to heat, and we understand
that the principle of heat is to be found in the heart, the continual motion going
on in this organ produces the incessant inspiration and exhalation of the air through the
lungs: wherefore also when the fiery element is unnaturally augmented, the breathing of
those fevered subjects becomes more rapid, as though the heart were endeavouring to quench
the flame implanted in it by more violent1743 breathing.</p>
<p>18. But since our nature is poor and in need of supplies for its own maintenance from
all quarters, it not only lacks air of its own, and the breath which excites heat, which it imports
from without for the preservation of the living being, but the nourishment it finds to fill out
the proportions of the body is an importation. Accordingly, it supplies the deficiency by
food and drink, implanting in the body a certain faculty for appropriating that which it requires,
and rejecting that which is superfluous, and for this purpose too the fire of the heart
gives nature no small assistance.</p>
<p>19. For since, according to the account we have given, the heart which kindles by its
warm breath the individual parts, is the most important of the vital organs, our Maker caused
<note type="footnote">1742 Reading (with Forbes’ marginal suggestion) ἐκπνοήν.</note>
<note type="footnote">1743 Or perhaps “fresher,” the heart seeking as it were for fresher and cooler air, and the breath being thus
accelerated in the effort to obtain it.</note>

<pb n="793"/>
it to be operative with its efficacious power at all points, that no part of it might be left ineffectual
or unprofitable for the regulation of the whole organism. Behind, therefore, it enters
the lungs, and, by its continuous motion, drawing that organ to itself, it expands the passages
to inhale the air, and compressing them again it brings about the exspiration of the imprisoned
air; while in front, attached to the space at the upper extremity of the stomach, it
warms it and makes it respond by motion to its own activity, rousing it, not to inhale air,
but to receive its appropriate food: for the entrances for breath and food are near one another,
extending lengthwise one alongside the other, and are terminated in their upper extremity
by the same boundary, so that their mouths are contiguous and the passages come to an
end together in one mouth, from which the entrance of food is effected through the one,
and that of the breath through the other.</p>
<p>20. Internally, however, the closeness of the connection of the passages is not maintained
throughout; for the heart intervening between the base of the two, infuses in the one the
powers for respiration, and in the other for nutriment. Now the fiery element is naturally
inclined to seek for the material which serves as fuel, and this necessarily happens with regard
to the receptacle of nourishment; for the more it becomes penetrated by fire through the
neighbouring warmth, the more it draws to itself what nourishes the heat. And this sort of
impulse we call appetite.</p>
<p>21. But if the organ which contains the food should obtain sufficient material, not even
so does the activity of the fire become quiescent: but it produces a sort of melting of the
material just as in a foundry, and, dissolving the solids, pours them out and transfers them,
as it were from a funnel, to the neighbouring passages: then separating the coarser from the
pure substance, it passes the fine part through certain channels to the entrance of the liver,
and expels the sedimentary matter of the food to the wider passages of the bowels, and by
turning it over in their manifold windings retains the food for a time in the intestines, lest
if it were easily got rid of by a straight passage it might at once excite the animal again to
appetite, and man, like the race of irrational animals, might never cease from this sort of
occupation.</p>
<p>22. As we saw, however, that the liver has especial need of the co-operation of heat for
the conversion of the fluids into blood, while this organ is in position distant from the heart
(for it would, I imagine, have been impossible that, being one principle or root of the vital
power, it should not be hampered by vicinity with another such principle), in order that the
system may suffer no injury by the distance at which the heat-giving substance is placed, a
muscular passage (and this, by those skilled in such matters, is called the artery) receives
the heated air from the heart and conveys it to the liver, making its opening there somewhere
beside the point at which the fluids enter, and, as it warms the moist substance by its heat,
blends with the liquid something akin to fire, and makes the blood appear red with the fiery
tint it produces.</p>

<pb n="794"/>
<p>23. Issuing thence again, certain twin channels, each enclosing its own current like a
pipe, disperse air and blood (that the liquid substance may have free course when accompanied
and lightened by the motion of the heated substance) in divers directions over the
whole body, breaking at every part into countless branching channels; while as the two
principles of the vital powers mingle together (that alike which disperses heat, and that
which supplies moisture to all parts of the body), they make, as it were, a sort of compulsory
contribution from the substance with which they deal to the supreme force in the vital
economy.</p>
<p>24. Now this force is that which is considered as residing in the cerebral membranes
and the brain, from which it comes that every movement of a joint, every contraction of the
muscles, every spontaneous influence that is exerted upon the individual members, renders
our earthen statue active and mobile as though by some mechanism. For the most pure
form of heat and the most subtle form of liquid, being united by their respective forces
through a process of mixture and combination, nourish and sustain by their moisture the
brain, and hence in turn, being rarefied to the most pure condition, the exhalation that
proceeds from that organ anoints the membrane which encloses the brain, which, reaching
from above downwards like a pipe, extending through the successive vertebræ, is (itself and
the marrow which is contained in it) conterminous with the base of the spine, itself giving
like a charioteer the impulse and power to all the meeting-points of bones and joints, and
to the branches of the muscles, for the motion or rest of the particular parts.</p>
<p>25. For this cause too it seems to me that it has been granted a more secure defence,
being distinguished, in the head, by a double shelter of bones round about, and in the vertebræ
of the neck by the bulwarks formed by the projections of the spine as well as by the
diversified interlacings of the very form of those vertebræ, by which it is kept in freedom
from all harm, enjoying safety by the defence that surrounds it.</p>
<p>26. So too one might suppose of the heart, that it is itself like some safe house fitted with
the most solid defences, fortified by the enclosing walls of the bones round about; for in
rear there is the spine, strengthened on either side by the shoulder-blades, and on each flank
the enfolding position of the ribs makes that which is in the midst between them difficult
to injure; while in front the breast-bone and the juncture of the collar-bone serve as a defence,
that its safety may be guarded at all points from external causes of danger.</p>
<p>27. As we see in husbandry, when the rain fall from the clouds or the overflow from the
river channels causes the land beneath it to be saturated with moisture (let us suppose for
our argument a garden, nourishing within its own compass countless varieties of trees, and
all the forms of plants that grow from the ground, and whereof we contemplate the figure,
quality, and individuality in great variety of detail); then, as these are nourished by the liquid
element while they are in one spot, the power which supplies moisture to each individual
among them is one in nature; but the individuality of the plants so nourished changes the

<pb n="795"/>
liquid element into different qualities; for the same substance becomes bitter in wormwood,
and is changed into a deadly juice in hemlock, and becomes different in different other
plants, in saffron, in balsam, in the poppy: for in one it becomes hot, in another cold, in
another it obtains the middle quality: and in laurel and mastick it is scented, and in the fig
and the pear it is sweetened, and by passing through the vine it is turned into the grape and
into wine; while the juice of the apple, the redness of the rose, the radiance of the lily, the
blue of the violet, the purple of the hyacinthine dye, and all that we behold in the earth, arise
from one and the same moisture, and are separated into so many varieties in respect of figure
and aspect and quality; the same sort of wonder is wrought in the animated soil of our being
by Nature, or rather by Nature’s Lord. Bones, cartilages, veins, arteries, nerves, ligatures,
flesh, skin, fat, hair, glands, nails, eyes, nostrils, ears,—all such things as these, and countless
others in addition, while separated from one another by various peculiarities, are nourished
by the one form of nourishment in ways proper to their own nature, in the sense that the
nourishment, when it is brought into close relation with any of the subjects, is also changed
according to that to which it approaches, and becomes adapted and allied to the special
nature of the part. For if it should be in the neighbourhood of the eye, it blends with the
visual part and is appropriately distributed by the difference of the coats round the eye,
among the single parts; or, if it flow to the auditory parts, it is mingled with the auscultatory
nature, or if it is in the lip, it becomes lip; and it grows solid in bone, and grows soft in
marrow, and is made tense with the sinew, and extended with the surface, and passes into
the nails, and is fined down for the growth of the hair, by correspondent exhalations, producing
hair that is somewhat curly or wavy if it makes its way through winding passages,
while, if the course of the exhalations that go to form the hair lies straight, it renders the
hair stiff and straight.</p>
<p>28. Our argument, however, has wandered far from its purpose, going deep into the
works of nature, and endeavouring to describe how and from what materials our particular
organs are formed, those, I mean, intended for life and for good life, and any other class
which we included with these in our first division.</p>
<p>29. For our purpose was to show that the seminal cause of our constitution is neither a
soul without body, nor a body without soul, but that, from animated and living bodies, it is
generated at the first as a living and animate being, and that our humanity takes it and
cherishes it like a nursling with the resources she herself possesses, and it thus grows on
both sides and makes its growth manifest correspondingly in either part:—for it at once
displays, by this artificial and scientific process of formation, the power of soul that is interwoven
in it, appearing at first somewhat obscurely, but afterwards increasing in radiance
concurrently with the perfecting of the work.</p>
<p>30. And as we may see with stone-carvers—for the artist’s purpose is to produce in stone
the figure of some animal; and with this in his mind, he first severs the stone from its kindred

<pb n="796"/>
matter, and then, by chipping away the superfluous parts of it, advances somehow by the
intermediate step of his first outline to the imitation which he has in his purpose, so that
even an unskilled observer may, by what he sees, conjecture the aim of his art; again, by
working at it, he brings it more nearly to the semblance of the object he has in view; lastly,
producing in the material the perfect and finished figure, he brings his art to its conclusion,
and that which a little before was a shapeless stone is a lion, or a man, or whatsoever it may
be that the artist has made, not by the change of the material into the figure, but by the figure
being wrought upon the material. If one supposes the like in the case of the soul he is not
far from probability; for we say that Nature, the all-contriving, takes from its kindred matter
the part that comes from the man, and moulds her statue within herself. And as the form
follows upon the gradual working of the stone, at first somewhat indistinct, but more perfect
after the completion of the work, so too in the moulding of its instrument the form of the
soul is expressed in the substratum, incompletely in that which is still incomplete, perfect
in that which is perfect; indeed it would have been perfect from the beginning had our nature
not been maimed by evil. Thus our community in that generation which is subject to passion
and of animal nature, brings it about that the Divine image does not at once shine forth at
our formation, but brings man to perfection by a certain method and sequence, through
those attributes of the soul which are material, and belong rather to the animal creation.</p>
<p>31. Some such doctrine as this the great apostle also teaches us in his Epistle to the
Corinthians, when he says, “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child; but when I became a man I put away childish things1744”; not that the
soul which arises in the man is different from that which we know to be in the boy, and the
childish intellect fails while the manly intellect takes its being in us; but that the same soul
displays its imperfect condition in the one, its perfect state in the other.</p>
<p>32. For we say that those things are alive which spring up and grow, and no one would
deny that all things that participate in life and natural motion are animate, yet at the same
time one cannot say that such life partakes of a perfect soul,—for though a certain animate
operation exists in plants, it does not attain to the motions of sense; and on the other hand,
though a certain further animate power exists in the brutes, neither does this attain perfection,
since it does not contain in itself the grace of reason and intelligence.</p>
<p>33. And even so we say that the true and perfect soul is the human soul, recognized by
every operation; and anything else that shares in life we call animate by a sort of customary
misuse of language, because in these cases the soul does not exist in a perfect condition, but
only certain parts of the operation of the soul, which in man also (according to Moses’
mystical account of man’s origin) we learn to have accrued when he made himself like this
sensuous world. Thus Paul, advising those who were able to hear him to lay hold on perfec-
<note type="footnote">1744 1 Cor. xiii. 11.</note>

<pb n="797"/>
tion, indicates also the mode in which they may attain that object, telling them that they
must “put off the old man,” and put on the man “which is renewed after the image of Him
that created him1745.”</p>
<p>34. Now may we all return to that Divine grace in which God at the first created man,
when He said, “Let us make man in our image and likeness”; to Whom be glory and might
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>On the Soul and the Resurrection.</head>
<head>Argument.</head>
<p>The mind, in times of bereavement, craves a certainty gained by reasoning as to the
existence of the soul after death.</p>
<p>First, then: Virtue will be impossible, if deprived of the life of eternity, her only advantage.</p>
<p>But this is a moral argument. The case calls for speculative and scientific treatment.</p>
<p>How is the objection that the nature of the soul, as of real things, is material, to be met?</p>
<p>Thus; the truth of this doctrine would involve the truth of Atheism; whereas Atheism
is refuted by the fact of the wise order that reigns in the world. In other words, the spirituality
of God cannot be denied: and this proves the possibility of spiritual or immaterial existence:
and therefore, that of the soul.</p>
<p>But is God, then, the same thing as the soul?</p>
<p>No: but man is “a little world in himself;” and we may with the same right conclude
from this Microcosm to the actual existence of an immaterial soul, as from the phenomena
of the world to the reality of God’s existence.</p>
<p>A Definition of the soul is then given, for the sake of clearness in the succeeding discussion.
It is a created, living, intellectual being, with the power, as long as it is provided with
organs, of sensuous perception. For “the mind sees,” not the eye; take, for instance, the
meaning of the phases of the moon. The objection that the “organic machine” of the body
produces all thought is met by the instance of the water-organ. Such machines, if thought
were really an attribute of matter, ought to build themselves spontaneously: whereas they
are a direct proof of an invisible thinking power in man. A work of Art means mind: there
is a thing perceived, and a thing not perceived.</p>
<p>But still, what is this thing not perceived?</p>
<p>If it has no sensible quality whatever—Where is it?</p>
<p>The answer is, that the same question might be asked about the Deity (Whose existence
is not denied).</p>
<p>Then the Mind and the Deity are identical?</p>
<p>Not so: in its substantial existence, as separable from matter, the soul is like God; but
this likeness does not extend to sameness; it resembles God as a copy the original.</p>
<p>As being “simple and uncompounded” the soul survives the dissolution of the composite
body, whose scattered elements it will continue to accompany, as if watching over its property
till the Resurrection, when it will clothe itself in them anew.</p>
<p>The soul was defined “an intellectual being.” But anger and desire are not of the body
either. Are there, then, two or three souls?—Answer. Anger and desire do not belong to the

<pb n="799"/>
essence of the soul, but are only among its varying states; they are not originally part of
ourselves, and we can and must rid ourselves of them, and bring them, as long as they continue
to mark our community with the brute creation, into the service of the good. They
are the “tares” of the heart, while they serve any other purpose.</p>
<p>But where will the soul “accompany its elements”?—Hades is not a particular spot; it
means the Invisible; those passages in the Bible in which the regions under the earth are alluded
to are explained as allegorical, although the partizans of the opposite interpretation
need not be combated.</p>
<p>But how will the soul know the scattered elements of the once familiar form? This is
answered by two illustrations (not analogies). The skill of the painter, the force that has
united numerous colours to form a single tint, will, if (by some miracle) that actual tint was
to fall back into those various colours, be cognizant of each one of these last, e.g. the tone
and size of the drop of gold, of red, U+0026c.; and could at will recombine them. The owner of a
cup of clay would know its fragments (by their shape) amidst a mass of fragments of clay
vessels of other shapes, or even if they were plunged again into their native clay. So the soul
knows its elements amidst their “kindred dust”; or when each one has flitted back to its own
primeval source on the confines of the Universe.</p>
<p>But how does this harmonize with the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus?</p>
<p>The bodies of both were in the grave: and so all that is said of them is in a spiritual sense.
But the soul can suffer still, being cognizant, not only of the elements of the whole body,
but of those that formed each member, e.g. the tongue. By the relations of the Rich Man are
meant the impressions made on his soul by the things of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>But if we must have no emotions in the next world, how shall there be virtue, and how
shall there be love of God? For anger, we saw, contributed to the one, desire to the other.</p>
<p>We shall be like God so far that we shall always contemplate the Beautiful in Him. Now,
God, in contemplating Himself, has no desire and hope, no regret and memory. The moment
of fruition is always present, and so His Love is perfect, without the need of any emotion.
So will it be with us. God draws “that which belongs to Him” to this blessed passionlessness;
and in this very drawing consists the torment of a passion-laden soul. Severe and longcontinued
pains in eternity are thus decreed to sinners, not because God hates them, nor
for the sake alone of punishing them; but “because what belongs to God must at any cost
be preserved for Him.” The degree of pain which must be endured by each one is necessarily
proportioned to the measure of the wickedness.</p>
<p>God will thus be “all in all”; yet the loved one’s form will then be woven, though into a
more ethereal texture, of the same elements as before. (This is not Nirvana.)</p>
<p>Here the doctrine of the Resurrection is touched. The Christian Resurrection and that
of the heathen philosophies coincide in that the soul is reclothed from some elements of the
Universe. But there are fatal objections to the latter under its two forms:

<pb n="800"/>
<lg>
<l>Transmigration pure and simple;</l>
<l>The Platonic Soul-rotation.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>The first—</p>
<p>1. Obliterates the distinction between the mineral or vegetable, and the spiritual,
world.</p>
<p>2. Makes it a sin to eat and drink.</p>
<p>Both—</p>
<p>3. Confuse the moral choice.</p>
<p>4. Make heaven the cradle of vice, and earth of virtue.</p>
<p>5. Contradict the truth that they assume, that there is no change in heaven.</p>
<p>6. Attribute every birth to a vice, and therefore are either Atheist or Manichæan.</p>
<p>7. Make a life a chapter of accidents.</p>
<p>8. Contradict facts of moral character.</p>
<p>God is the cause of our life, both in body and soul.</p>
<p>But when and how does the soul come into existence?</p>
<p>The how we can never know.</p>
<p>There are objections to seeking the material for any created thing either in God, or
outside God. But we may regard the whole Creation as the realized thoughts of God. (Anticipation
of Malebranche.)</p>
<p>The when may be determined. Objections to the existence of soul before body have been
given above. But soul is necessary to life, and the embryo lives.</p>
<p>Therefore soul is not born after body. So body and soul are born together.</p>
<p>As to the number of souls, Humanity itself is a thought of God not yet completed, as
these continual additions prove. When it is completed, this “progress of Humanity” will
cease, by there being no more births: and no births, no deaths.</p>
<p>Before answering objections to the Scriptural doctrine of the Resurrection, the passages
that contain it are mentioned: especially Psalm cxviii. 27 (LXX.).</p>
<p>The various objections to it, to the Purgatory to follow, and to the Judgment, are then
stated; especially that</p>
<p>A man is not the same being (physically) two days together. Which phase of him, then,
is to rise again, be tortured (if need be), and judged?</p>
<p>They are all answered by a Definition of the Resurrection, i.e. the restoration of man to
his original state. In that, there is neither age nor infancy; and the “coats of skins” are laid
aside.</p>
<p>When the process of purification has been completed, the better attributes of the soul
appear—imperishability, life, honour, grace, glory, power, and, in short, all that belongs to
human nature as the image of Deity.</p>

<head>On the Soul and the Resurrection.</head>
<p>Basil, great amongst the saints, had departed from this life to God; and the impulse to
mourn for him was shared by all the churches. But his sister the Teacher was still living; and
so I journeyed to her1746, yearning for an interchange of sympathy over the loss of her
brother. My soul was right sorrow-stricken by this grievous blow, and I sought for one who
could feel it equally, to mingle my tears with. But when we were in each other’s presence
the sight of the Teacher awakened all my pain; for she too was lying in a state of prostration
even unto death. Well, she gave in to me for a little while, like a skilful driver, in the ungovernable
violence of my grief; and then she tried to check me by speaking, and to correct with
the curb of her reasonings the disorder of my soul. She quoted the Apostle’s words about
the duty of not being “grieved for them that sleep”; because only “men without hope” have
such feelings. With a heart still fermenting with my pain, I asked—</p>
<p>1747 How can that ever be practised by mankind? There is such an instinctive and deepseated
abhorrence of death in all! Those who look on a death-bed can hardly bear the sight;
<note type="footnote">1746 Gregory himself tells us, in his life of S. Macrina, that he went to see her after the Council of Antioch.
(This and Basil’s death occurred in the year 379: so that this Dialogue was probably composed in 380.) “The
interval during which the circumstances of our times of trials prevented any visits had been long.” He goes on
to say (p. 189 B.); “And that she might cause me no depression of spirits, she somehow subdued the noise and
concealed the difficulty of her breathing, and assumed perfect cheerfulness: she not only started pleasant topics
herself, but suggested them as well by the questions which she asked. The conversation led naturally to the
mention of our great Basil. While my very soul sank and my countenance was saddened and fell, she herself was
so far from going with me into the depths of mourning, that she made the mention of that saintly name all opportunity
for the most sublime philosophy. Examining human nature in a scientific way, disclosing the divine
plan that underlies all afflictions, and dealing, as if inspired by the Holy Spirit, with all the questions relating to
a future life, she maintained such a discourse that my soul seemed to be lifted along with her words almost
beyond the compass of humanity, and, as I followed her argument, to be placed within the sanctuary of heaven.”
Again (p. 190 B): “And if my tract would not thereby be extended to an endless length, I would have reported
everything in its order; i.e. how her argument lifted her as she went into the philosophy both of the soul, and of
the causes of our life in the flesh, and of the final cause of Man and his mortality, and of death and the return
thence into life again. In all of it her reasoning continued clear and consecutive: it flowed on so easily and naturally
that it was like the water from some spring falling unimpeded downwards.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1747 Two grounds are here given why this practice of grief for the departed is difficult to give up. One lies in
the natural abhorrence of death, showing itself in two ways, viz. in our grief over others dying, and in recoiling
from our own death, expressed by two evenly balanced sentences, οὔτε τῶν ὁρώντων…οἷς τε ἄν…; in the latter
a second οὔτε might have been expected; but such an anacoluthon is frequent in dialogue. Oehler is wrong in</note>

<pb n="802"/>
and those whom death approaches recoil from him all they can. Why, even the law that
controls us puts death highest on the list of crimes, and highest on the list of punishments.
By what device, then, can we bring ourselves to regard as nothing a departure from life even
in the case of a stranger, not to mention that of relations, when so be they cease to live? We
see before us the whole course of human life aiming at this one thing, viz. how we may
continue in this life; indeed it is for this that houses have been invented by us to live in; in
order that our bodies may not be prostrated in their environment1748 by cold or heat. Agriculture,
again, what is it but the providing of our sustenance? In fact all thought about how
we are to go on living is occasioned by the fear of dying. Why is medicine so honoured
amongst men? Because it is thought to carry on the combat with death to a certain extent
by its methods. Why do we have corslets, and long shields, and greaves, and helmets, and
all the defensive armour, and inclosures of fortifications, and iron-barred gates, except that
we fear to die? Death then being naturally so terrible to us, how can it be easy for a survivor
to obey this command to remain unmoved over friends departed?</p>
<p>Why, what is the especial pain you feel, asked the Teacher, in the mere necessity itself
of dying? This common talk of unthinking persons is no sufficient accusation.</p>
<p>What! is there no occasion for grieving, I replied to her, when we see one who so lately
lived and spoke becoming all of a sudden lifeless and motionless, with the sense of every
bodily organ extinct, with no sight or hearing in operation, or any other faculty of apprehen-
sion that sense possesses; and if you apply fire or steel to him, even if you were to plunge a
sword into the body, or cast it to the beasts of prey, or if you bury it beneath a mound, that
dead man is alike unmoved at any treatment? Seeing, then, that this change is observed in
all these ways, and that principle of life, whatever it might be, disappears all at once out of
sight, as the flame of an extinguished lamp which burnt on it the moment before neither
remains upon the wick nor passes to some other place, but completely disappears, how can
such a change be borne without emotion by one who has no clear ground to rest upon? We
hear the departure of the spirit, we see the shell that is left; but of the part that has been
separated we are ignorant, both as to its nature, and as to the place whither it has fled; for
neither earth, nor air, nor water, nor any other element can show as residing within itself
this force that has left the body, at whose withdrawal a corpse only remains, ready for dissolution.</p>
<note type="footnote">giving to the second τε an intensive force, i.e. “much more.” The other ground lies in the attitude of the law towards
death.</note>
<note type="footnote">1748 Reading περιέχοντι: the same word is used below, “as long as the breath within was held in by the enveloping
substance”(see p. 432, note 8). Here it means “the air”: as in Marcus Antoninus, Lib. iv. 39.</note>

<pb n="803"/>
<p>Whilst I was thus enlarging on the subject, the Teacher signed to me with her hand1749,
and said: Surely what alarms and disturbs your mind is not the thought that the soul, instead
of lasting for ever, ceases with the body’s dissolution!</p>
<p>I answered rather audaciously, and without due consideration of what I said, for my
passionate grief had not yet given me back my judgment. In fact, I said that the Divine utterances
seemed to me like mere commands compelling us to believe that the soul lasts for
ever; not, however, that we were led by them to this belief by any reasoning. Our mind
within us appears slavishly to accept the opinion enforced, but not to acquiesce with a
spontaneous impulse. Hence our sorrow over the departed is all the more grievous; we do
not exactly know whether this vivifying principle is anything by itself; where it is, or how it
is; whether, in fact, it exists in any way at all anywhere. This uncertainty1750 about the real
state of the case balances the opinions on either side; many adopt the one view, many the
other; and indeed there are certain persons, of no small philosophical reputation amongst
the Greeks, who have held and maintained this which I have just said.</p>
<p>Away, she cried, with that pagan nonsense! For therein the inventor of lies fabricates
false theories only to harm the Truth. Observe this, and nothing else; that such a view about
the soul amounts to nothing less than the abandoning of virtue, and seeking the pleasure
of the moment only; the life of eternity, by which alone virtue claims the advantage, must
be despaired of.</p>
<p>And pray how, I asked, are we to get a firm and unmovable belief in the soul’s continuance?
I, too, am sensible of the fact that human life will be bereft of the most beautiful ornament
that life has to give, I mean virtue, unless an undoubting confidence with regard to
this be established within us. What, indeed, has virtue to stand upon in the case of those
persons who conceive of this present life as the limit of their existence, and hope for nothing
beyond?</p>
<p>Well, replied the Teacher, we must seek where we may get a beginning for our discussion
upon this point; and if you please, let the defence of the opposing views be undertaken by
yourself; for I see that your mind is a little inclined to accept such a brief. Then, after the
conflicting belief has been stated, we shall be able to look for the truth.</p>
<note type="footnote">1749 Reading κατασείσασα τῇ χειρὶ, instead of the vox nihili μετασείσασα of the two Paris Editions, which
can be accounted for by μετα being repeated in error from μεταξυ. The question which this gesture accompanied
is one to which it would be very appropriate. The reading adopted is that of the Codex Uffenbach, and this
phrase, κατασείειν τῇ χειρὶ, is unimpeachable for “commanding silence,” being used by Polybius, and Xenophon
(without χειρὶ). Wolf and Krabinger prefer this reading to that of most of the Codd., κατασιγήσασα: and
doubtless Sifanus read it (“manu silentio imperato”).</note>
<note type="footnote">1750 ἴσας…ἀδηλία. This is Krabinger’s reading (for ἴσως…ἡ δειλία in the Parisian Editions) with abundant

<pb n="804"/>
<p>When she made this request, and I had deprecated the suspicion that I was making the
objections in real earnest, instead of only wishing to get a firm ground for the belief about
the soul by calling into court1751 first what is aimed against this view, I began—</p>
<p>Would not the defenders of the opposite belief say this: that the body, being composite,
must necessarily be resolved into that of which it is composed? And when the coalition of
elements in the body ceases, each of those elements naturally gravitates towards its kindred
element with the irresistible bias of like to like; the heat in us will thus unite with heat, the
earthy with the solid, and each of the other elements also will pass towards its like. Where,
then, will the soul be after that? If one affirm that it is in those elements, one will be obliged
to admit that it is identical with them, for this fusion could not possibly take place between
two things of different natures. But this being granted, the soul must necessarily be viewed
as a complex thing, fused as it is with qualities so opposite. But the complex is not simple,
but must be classed with the composite, and the composite is necessarily dissoluble; and
dissolution means the destruction of the compound; and the destructible is not immortal,
else the flesh itself, resolvable as it is into its constituent elements, might so be called immortal.
If, on the other hand, the soul is something other than these elements, where can our
reason suggest a place for it to be, when it is thus, by virtue of its alien nature, not to be
discovered in those elements, and there is no other place in the world, either, where it may
continue, in harmony with its own peculiar character, to exist? But, if a thing can be found
nowhere, plainly it has no existence.</p>
<p>The Teacher sighed gently at these words of mine, and then said; Maybe these were the
objections, or such as these, that the Stoics and Epicureans collected at Athens made in answer
to the Apostle. I hear that Epicurus carried his theories in this very direction. The framework
of things was to his mind a fortuitous1752 and mechanical affair, without a Providence
penetrating its operations; and, as a piece with this, he thought that human life was like a
<note type="footnote">1751 ἀντιπιπτόντων πρὸς τὸν σκοπὸν τοῦτον ὑποκληθέντων: the reading of the Parisian Editions. But the
preponderance of ms. authority is in favour of ὑπεκλυθέντων, “si quæ ad hoc propositum opponuntur soluta

a butt set up to be shot at. All the mss. but not the Paris Editions, have the article before ἀντιπιπτότων: but it is
not absolutely necessary, for Gregory not unfrequently omits it before participles, when his meaning is general,

what he must have said about the human soul: i.e. that it was a bubble; and then what his followers
probably said. There is no evidence that Epicurus used this actual figure: still Gregory may be recording his very

bubble, existing only as long as the breath within was held in by the enveloping substance1753,
inasmuch as our body was a mere membrane, as it were, encompassing a breath; and that
on the collapse of the inflation the imprisoned essence was extinguished. To him the visible
was the limit of existence; he made our senses the only means of our apprehension of things;
he completely closed the eyes of his soul, and was incapable of seeing anything in the intelligible
and immaterial world, just as a man, who is imprisoned in a cabin whose walls and
roof obstruct the view outside, remains without a glimpse of all the wonders of the sky.
Verily, everything in the universe that is seen to be an object of sense is as an earthen wall,
forming in itself a barrier between the narrower souls and that intelligible world which is
ready for their contemplation; and it is the earth and water and fire alone that such behold;
whence comes each of these elements, in what and by what they are encompassed, such
souls because of their narrowness cannot detect. While the sight of a garment suggests to
any one the weaver of it, and the thought of the shipwright comes at the sight of the ship,
and the hand of the builder is brought to the mind of him who sees the building, these little
souls gaze upon the world, but their eyes are blind to Him whom all this that we see around
us makes manifest; and so they propound their clever and pungent doctrines about the
soul’s evanishment;—body from elements, and elements from body, and, besides, the impossibility
of the soul’s self-existence (if it is not to be one of these elements, or lodged in
one); for if these opponents suppose that by virtue of the soul not being akin to the elements
it is nowhere after death, they must propound, to begin with, the absence of the soul from
the fleshly life as well, seeing that the body itself is nothing but a concourse of those elements;
and so they must not tell us that the soul is to be found there either, independently vivifying
their compound. If it is not possible for the soul to exist after death, though the elements
do, then, I say, according to this teaching our life as well is proved to be nothing else but
death. But if on the other hand they do not make the existence of the soul now in the body
a question for doubt, how can they maintain its evanishment when the body is resolved into
its elements? Then, secondly, they must employ an equal audacity against the God in this
Nature too. For how can they assert that the intelligible and immaterial Unseen can be dissolved
and diffused into the wet and the soft, as also into the hot and the dry, and so hold
together the universe in existence through being, though not of a kindred nature with the

things which it penetrates, yet not thereby incapable of so penetrating them? Let them,
therefore, remove from their system the very Deity Who upholds the world.</p>
<p>That is the very point, I said, upon which our adversaries cannot fail to have doubts;
viz. that all things depend on God and are encompassed by Him, or, that there is any divinity
at all transcending the physical world.</p>
<p>It would be more fitting, she cried, to be silent about such doubts, and not to deign to
make any answer to such foolish and wicked propositions; for there is a Divine precept
forbidding us to answer a fool in his folly; and he must be a fool, as the Prophet declares,
who says that there is no God. But since one needs must speak, I will urge upon you an argument
which is not mine nor that of any human being (for it would then be of small value,
whosoever spoke it), but an argument which the whole Creation enunciates by the medium
of its wonders to the audience1754 of the eye, with a skilful and artistic utterance that reaches
the heart. The Creation proclaims outright the Creator; for the very heavens, as the Prophet
says, declare the glory of God with their unutterable words. We see the universal harmony
in the wondrous sky and on the wondrous earth; how elements essentially opposed to each
other are all woven together in an ineffable union to serve one common end, each contributing
its particular force to maintain the whole; how the unmingling and mutually repellent
do not fly apart from each other by virtue of their peculiarities, any more than they are
destroyed, when compounded, by such contrariety; how those elements which are naturally
buoyant move downwards, the heat of the sun, for instance, descending in the rays, while
the bodies which possess weight are lifted by becoming rarefied in vapour, so that water
contrary to its nature ascends, being conveyed through the air to the upper regions; how
too that fire of the firmament so penetrates the earth that even its abysses feel the heat; how
the moisture of the rain infused into the soil generates, one though it be by nature, myriads
of differing germs, and animates in due proportion each subject of its influence; how very
swiftly the polar sphere revolves, how the orbits within it move the contrary way, with all
the eclipses, and conjunctions, and measured intervals1755 of the planets. We see all this
with the piercing eyes of mind, nor can we fail to be taught by means of such a spectacle
that a Divine power, working with skill and method, is manifesting itself in this actual world,
and, penetrating each portion, combines those portions with the whole and completes the

whole by the portions, and encompasses the universe with a single all-controlling force,
self-centred and self-contained, never ceasing from its motion, yet never altering the position
which it holds.</p>
<p>And pray how, I asked, does this belief in the existence of God prove along with it the
existence of the human soul? For God, surely, is not the same thing as the soul, so that, if
the one were believed in, the other must necessarily be believed in.</p>
<p>She replied: It has been said by wise men that man is a little world1756 in himself and
contains all the elements which go to complete the universe. If this view is a true one (and
so it seems), we perhaps shall need no other ally than it to establish the truth of our conception
of the soul. And our conception of it is this; that it exists, with a rare and peculiar nature
of its own, independently of the body with its gross texture. We get our exact knowledge of
this outer world from the apprehension of our senses, and these sensational operations
themselves lead us on to the understanding of the super-sensual world of fact and thought,
and our eye thus becomes the interpreter of that almighty wisdom which is visible in the
universe, and points in itself to the Being Who encompasses it. Just so, when we look to our
inner world, we find no slight grounds there also, in the known, for conjecturing the unknown;
and the unknown there also is that which, being the object of thought and not of
sight, eludes the grasp of sense.</p>
<p>I rejoined, Nay, it may be very possible to infer a wisdom transcending the universe
from the skilful and artistic designs observable in this harmonized fabric of physical nature;
but, as regards the soul, what knowledge is possible to those who would trace, from any indications
the body has to give, the unknown through the known?</p>
<p>Most certainly, the Virgin replied, the soul herself, to those who wish to follow the wise
proverb and know themselves, is a competent1757 instructress; of the fact, I mean, that she
is an immaterial and spiritual thing, working and moving in a way corresponding to her
peculiar nature, and evincing these peculiar emotions through the organs of the body. For
this bodily organization exists the same even in those who have just been reduced by death
to the state of corpses, but it remains without motion or action because the force of the soul
is no longer in it. It moves only when there is sensation in the organs, and not only that, but
the mental force by means of that sensation penetrates with its own impulses and moves
whither it will all those organs of sensation.</p>
<p>What then, I asked, is the soul? Perhaps there may be some possible means of delineating
its nature; so that we may have some comprehension of this subject, in the way of a sketch.</p>
<p>Its definition, the Teacher replied, has been attempted in different ways by different
writers, each according to his own bent; but the following is our opinion about it. The soul

is an essence created, and living, and intellectual, transmitting from itself to an organized
and sentient body the power of living and of grasping objects of sense, as long as a natural
constitution capable of this holds together.</p>
<p>Saying this she pointed to the physician1758 who was sitting to watch her state, and said:
There is a proof of what I say close by us. How, I ask, does this man, by putting his fingers
to feel the pulse, hear in a manner, through this sense of touch, Nature calling loudly to him
and telling him of her peculiar pain; in fact, that the disease in the body is an inflammatory
one1759, and that the malady originates in this or that internal organ; and that there is such
and such a degree of fever? How too is he taught by the agency of the eye other facts of this
kind, when he looks to see the posture of the patient and watches the wasting of the flesh?
As, too, the state of the complexion, pale somewhat and bilious, and the gaze of the eyes, as
is the case with those in pain, involuntarily inclining to sadness, indicate the internal condition,
so the ear gives information of the like, ascertaining the nature of the malady by the
shortness of the breathing and by the groan that comes with it. One might say that even the
sense of smell in the expert is not incapable of detecting the kind of disorder, but that it
notices the secret suffering of the vitals in the particular quality of the breath. Could this be
so if there were not a certain force of intelligence present in each organ of the senses? What
would our hand have taught us of itself, without thought conducting it from feeling to understanding
the subject before it? What would the ear, as separate from mind, or the eye or
the nostril or any other organ have helped towards the settling of the question, all by
themselves? Verily, it is most true what one of heathen culture is recorded to have said, that
it is the mind that sees and the mind that hears1760. Else, if you will not allow this to be true,
you must tell me why, when you look at the sun, as you have been trained by your instructor
to look at him, you assert that he is not in the breadth of his disc of the size he appears to
the many, but that he exceeds by many times the measure of the entire earth. Do you not

passage, which is interesting because, the terms being used specially, if not only, of fevers or inflammation, it is
evident that the speaker has her own illness in mind, and her words are thus more natural than if she spoke of
patients generally. If ἐν ἐπίτασει is translated “at its height,” this will very awkwardly anticipate what follows,
ἐπὶ τοσόνδε…ἡ ἐπίτασις. The doctor is supposed simply to class the complaint as belonging to the order of those
which manifest themselves δι᾽ ἐπιτάσεως, as opposed to those which do so δι᾽ ἀνέσεως: he then descends to
particulars, i.e. ἐπὶ τοσόνδε. The demonstrative in τῶνδε τῶν σπλάγχνων has the same force as in τὸ ἐν τῶδε

confidently maintain that it is so, because you have arrived by reasoning through phenomena
at the conception of such and such a movement, of such distances of time and space, of such
causes of eclipse? And when you look at the waning and waxing moon you are taught other
truths by the visible figure of that heavenly body, viz. that it is in itself devoid of light, and
that it revolves in the circle nearest to the earth, and that it is lit by light from the sun; just
as is the case with mirrors, which, receiving the sun upon them, do not reflect rays of their
own, but those of the sun, whose light is given back from their smooth flashing surface.
Those who see this, but do not examine it, think that the light comes from the moon herself.
But that this is not the case is proved by this; that when she is diametrically facing the sun
she has the whole of the disc that looks our way illuminated; but, as she traverses her own
circle of revolution quicker from moving in a narrower space, she herself has completed
this more than twelve times before the sun has once travelled round his; whence it happens
that her substance is not always covered with light. For her position facing him is not
maintained in the frequency of her revolutions; but, while this position causes the whole
side of the moon which looks to us to be illumined, directly she moves sideways her hemisphere
which is turned to us necessarily becomes partially shadowed, and only that which
is turned to him meets his embracing rays; the brightness, in fact, keeps on retiring from
that which can no longer see the sun to that which still sees him, until she passes right across
the sun’s disc and receives his rays upon her hinder part; and then the fact of her being in
herself totally devoid of light and splendour causes the side turned to us to be invisible while
the further hemisphere is all in light; and this is called the completion1761 of her waning.
But when again, in her own revolution, she has passed the sun and she is transverse to his
rays, the side which was dark just before begins to shine a little, for the rays move from the
illumined part to that so lately invisible. You see what the eye does teach; and yet it would
never of itself have afforded this insight, without something that looks through the eyes and
uses the data of the senses as mere guides to penetrate from the apparent to the unseen. It
is needless to add the methods of geometry that lead us step by step through visible delineations
to truths that lie out of sight, and countless other instances which all prove that apprehension
is the work of an intellectual essence deeply seated in our nature, acting through
the operation of our bodily senses.</p>

<p>But what, I asked, if, insisting on the great differences which, in spite of a certain quality
of matter shared alike by all elements in their visible form, exist between each particular
kind of matter (motion, for instance, is not the same in all, some moving up, some down;
nor form, nor quality either), some one were to say that there was in the same manner incorporated
in, and belonging to, these elements a certain force1762 as well which effects
these intellectual insights and operations by a purely natural effort of their own (such effects,
for instance, as we often see produced by the mechanists, in whose hands matter, combined
according to the rules of Art, thereby imitates Nature, exhibiting resemblance not in figure
alone but even in motion, so that when the piece of mechanism sounds in its resonant part
it mimics a human voice, without, however, our being able to perceive anywhere any mental
force working out the particular figure, character, sound, and movement); suppose, I say,
we were to affirm that all this was produced as well in the organic machine of our natural
bodies, without any intermixture of a special thinking substance, but owing simply to an
inherent motive power of the elements within us accomplishing1763 by itself these operations—
to nothing else, in fact, but an impulsive movement working for the cognition of the
object before us; would not then the fact stand proved of the absolute nonexistence1764 of
that intellectual and impalpable Being, the soul, which you talk of?</p>
<p>Your instance, she replied, and your reasoning upon it, though belonging to the counterargument,
may both of them be made allies of our statement, and will contribute not a little
to the confirmation of its truth.</p>
<p>Why, how can you say that?</p>
<p>Because, you see, so to understand, manipulate, and dispose the soulless matter, that
the art which is stored away in such mechanisms becomes almost like a soul to this material,
in all the various ways in which it mocks movement, and figure, and voice, and so on, may
be turned into a proof of there being something in man whereby he shows an innate fitness

here is in τούτων, which Krabinger takes as a partitive genitive after εἶναι, and refers to the “elements”; and this
is perhaps the best way of taking it. But still, as Schmidt points out, it is rather the human body than the elements
themselves that ought here to be spoken of as the efficient cause of thought: and so he would either refer τούτων

to think out within himself, through the contemplative and inventive faculties, such thoughts,
and having prepared such mechanisms in theory, to put them into practice by manual skill,
and exhibit in matter the product of his mind. First, for instance, he saw, by dint of thinking,
that to produce any sound there is need of some wind; and then, with a view to produce
wind in the mechanism, he previously ascertained by a course of reasoning and close observation
of the nature of elements, that there is no vacuum at all in the world, but that the
lighter is to be considered a vacuum only by comparison with the heavier; seeing that the
air itself, taken as a separate subsistence, is crowded quite full. It is by an abuse of language
that a jar is said to be “empty”; for when it is empty of any liquid it is none the less, even in
this state, full, in the eyes of the experienced. A proof of this is that a jar when put into a
pool of water is not immediately filled, but at first floats on the surface, because the air it
contains helps to buoy up its rounded sides; till at last the hand of the drawer of the water
forces it down to the bottom, and, when there, it takes in water by its neck; during which
process it is shown not to have been empty even before the water came; for there is the
spectacle of a sort of combat going on in the neck between the two elements, the water being
forced by its weight into the interior, and therefore streaming in; the imprisoned air on the
other hand being straitened for room by the gush of the water along the neck, and so rushing
in the contrary direction; thus the water is checked by the strong current of air, and gurgles
and bubbles against it. Men observed this, and devised in accordance with this property of
the two elements a way of introducing air to work their mechanism1765. They made a kind
of cavity of some hard stuff, and prevented the air in it from escaping in any direction; and
then introduced water into this cavity through its mouth, apportioning the quantity of water
according to requirement; next they allowed an exit in the opposite direction to the air, so
that it passed into a pipe placed ready to hand, and in so doing, being violently constrained
by the water, became a blast; and this, playing on the structure of the pipe, produced a note.
Is it not clearly proved by such visible results that there is a mind of some kind in man,
something other than that which is visible, which, by virtue of an invisible thinking nature
of its own, first prepares by inward invention such devices, and then, when they have been
so matured, brings them to the light and exhibits them in the subservient matter? For if it
were possible to ascribe such wonders, as the theory of our opponents does, to the actual
constitution of the elements, we should have these mechanisms building themselves spontaneously;
the bronze would not wait for the artist, to be made into the likeness of a man,
but would become such by an innate force; the air would not require the pipe, to make a
note, but would sound spontaneously by its own fortuitous flux and motion; and the jet of
the water upwards would not be, as it now is, the result of an artificial pressure forcing it to

move in an unnatural direction, but the water would rise into the mechanism of its own
accord, finding in that direction a natural channel. But if none of these results are produced
spontaneously by elemental force, but, on the contrary, each element is employed at will by
artifice; and if artifice is a kind of movement and activity of mind, will not the very consequences
of what has been urged by way of objection show us Mind as something other
than the thing perceived?</p>
<p>That the thing perceived, I replied, is not the same as the thing not perceived, I grant;
but I do not discover any answer to our question in such a statement; it is not yet clear to
me what we are to think that thing not-perceived to be; all I have been shown by your argument
is that it is not anything material; and I do not yet know the fitting name for it. I wanted
especially to know what it is, not what it is not.</p>
<p>We do learn, she replied, much about many things by this very same method, inasmuch
as, in the very act of saying a thing is “not so and so,” we by implication interpret the very
nature of the thing in question1766. For instance, when we say a “guileless,” we indicate a
good man; when we say “unmanly,” we have expressed that a man is a coward; and it is
possible to suggest a great many things in like fashion, wherein we either convey the idea
of goodness by the negation of badness1767, or vice versâ. Well, then, if one thinks so with
regard to the matter now before us, one will not fail to gain a proper conception of it. The
question is,—What are we to think of Mind in its very essence? Now granted that the inquirer
has had his doubts set at rest as to the existence of the thing in question, owing to the
activities which it displays to us, and only wants to know what it is, he will have adequately
discovered it by being told that it is not that which our senses perceive, neither a colour,
nor a form, nor a hardness, nor a weight, nor a quantity, nor a cubic dimension, nor a point,
nor anything else perceptible in matter; supposing, that is,1768 that there does exist a
something beyond all these.</p>
<note type="footnote">1766 Remove comma after ζητουμένου, in Paris Editt.</note>
<note type="footnote">1767 or vice versâ, i.e. the idea of badness by the negation of goodness. Krabinger appositely quotes a passage
from Plotinus: “Who could picture to himself evil as a specific thing, appearing as it does only in the absence of
each good?…it will be necessary for all who are to know what evil is to have a clear conception about good: since
even in dealing with real species the better take precedence of the worse; and evil is not even a species, but rather
a negation.” Cf. Origen, In Johan. p. 66 A, πᾶσα ἡ κακία οὐδέν ἐστιν, ἐπεὶ καὶ οὐκ ὂν τυγχάνει. See also Gregory’s

the less supported reading οἶδεν ὅτι, which is open to the further objection that it would be absurd to say, “when
a man learns that A is not B he knows that it is something else.” The reading of the Paris. Editt. ἴδῃ is unintelligible.</note>

<p>Here I interrupted her discourse: If you leave all these out of the account I do not see
how you can possibly avoid cancelling along with them the very thing which you are in
search of. I cannot at present conceive to what, as apart from these, the perceptive activity
is to cling. For on all occasions in investigating with the scrutinizing intellect the contents
of the world, we must, so far as we put our hand1769 at all on what we are seeking, inevitably
touch, as blind men feeling along the walls for the door, some one of those things aforesaid;
we must come on colour, or form, or quantity, or something else on your list; and when it
comes to saying that the thing is none of them, our feebleness of mind induces us to suppose
that it does not exist at all.</p>
<p>Shame on such absurdity! said she, indignantly interrupting. A fine conclusion this
narrow-minded, grovelling view of the world brings us to! If all that is not cognizable by
sense is to be wiped out of existence, the all-embracing Power that presides over things is
admitted by this same assertion not to be; once a man has been told about the non-material
and invisible nature of the Deity, he must perforce with such a premise reckon it as absolutely
non-existent. If, on the other hand, the absence of such characteristics in His case does not
constitute any limitation of His existence, how can the Mind of man be squeezed out of existence
along with this withdrawal one by one of each property of matter?</p>
<p>Well, then, I retorted, we only exchange one paradox for another by arguing in this way;
for our reason will be reduced to the conclusion that the Deity and the Mind of man are
identical, if it be true that neither can be thought of, except by the withdrawal of all the data
of sense.</p>
<p>Say not so, she replied; to talk so also is blasphemous. Rather, as the Scripture tells you,
say that the one is like the other. For that which is “made in the image” of the Deity necessarily
possesses a likeness to its prototype in every respect; it resembles it in being intellec-
tual, immaterial, unconnected with any notion of weight1770, and in eluding any measurement
of its dimensions1771; yet as regards its own peculiar nature it is something different
from that other. Indeed, it would be no longer an “image,” if it were altogether identical
with that other; but1772 where we have A in that uncreate prototype we have a in the image;
just as in a minute particle of glass, when it happens to face the light, the complete disc of

tions of those ineffable qualities of Deity shine forth within the narrow limits of our nature;
and so our reason, following the leading of these reflections, will not miss grasping the Mind
in its essence by clearing away from the question all corporeal qualities; nor on the other
hand will it bring the pure1773 and infinite Existence to the level of that which is perishable
and little; it will regard this essence of the Mind as an object of thought only, since it is the
“image” of an Existence which is such; but it will not pronounce this image to be identical
with the prototype. Just, then, as we have no doubts, owing to the display of a Divine mysterious
wisdom in the universe, about a Divine Being and a Divine Power existing in it all
which secures its continuance (though if you required a definition of that Being you would
therein find the Deity completely sundered from every object in creation, whether of sense
or thought, while in these last, too, natural distinctions are admitted), so, too, there is
nothing strange in the soul’s separate existence as a substance (whatever we may think that
substance to be) being no hindrance to her actual existence, in spite of the elemental atoms
of the world not harmonizing with her in the definition of her being. In the case of our living
bodies, composed as they are from the blending of these atoms, there is no sort of communion,
as has been just said, on the score of substance, between the simplicity and invisibility
of the soul, and the grossness of those bodies; but, notwithstanding that, there is not a doubt
that there is in them the soul’s vivifying influence exerted by a law which it is beyond the
human understanding to comprehend1774. Not even then, when those atoms have again
been dissolved1775 into themselves, has that bond of a vivifying influence vanished; but as,
while the framework of the body still holds together, each individual part is possessed of a
soul which penetrates equally every component member, and one could not call that soul
hard and resistent though blended with the solid, nor humid, or cold, or the reverse, though
it transmits life to all and each of such parts, so, when that framework is dissolved, and has
returned to its kindred elements, there is nothing against probability that that simple and
incomposite essence which has once for all by some inexplicable law grown with the growth
of the bodily framework should continually remain beside the atoms with which it has been
<note type="footnote">1773 pure(ἀκηράτῳ). perishable (ἐπίκηρον). The first word is a favourite one with the Platonists; such as
Plotinus, and Synesius. Gregory uses it in his funeral speech over Flacilla, “she passes with a soul unstained to
the pure and perfect life”; and both in his treatise De Mortuis, “that man’s grief is real, who becomes conscious
of the blessings he has lost; and contrasts this perishing and soiled existence with the perfect blessedness above.”</note>

blended, and should in no way be sundered from a union once formed. For it does not follow
that because the composite is dissolved the incomposite must be dissolved with it1776.</p>
<p>That those atoms, I rejoined, should unite and again be separated, and that this constitutes
the formation and dissolution of the body, no one would deny. But we have to consider
this. There are great intervals between these atoms; they differ from each other, both in
position, and also in qualitative distinctions and peculiarities. When, indeed, these atoms
have all converged upon the given subject, it is reasonable that that intelligent and undimensional
essence which we call the soul should cohere with that which is so united; but once
these atoms are separated from each other, and have gone whither their nature impels them,
what is to become of the soul when her vessel1777 is thus scattered in many directions? As
a sailor, when his ship has been wrecked and gone to pieces, cannot float upon all the pieces
at once1778 which have been scattered this way and that over the surface of the sea (for he
seizes any bit that comes to hand, and lets all the rest drift away), in the same way the soul,
being by nature incapable of dissolution along with the atoms, will, if she finds it hard to be
parted from the body altogether, cling to some one of them; and if we take this view, consistency
will no more allow us to regard her as immortal for living in one atom than as
mortal for not living in a number of them.</p>
<p>But the intelligent and undimensional, she replied, is neither contracted nor diffused1779
(contraction and diffusion being a property of body only); but by virtue of a nature which
is formless and bodiless it is present with the body equally in the contraction and in the
diffusion of its atoms, and is no more narrowed by the compression which attends the
uniting of the atoms than it is abandoned by them when they wander off to their kindred,

being incomposite. So that the γὰρ here does not give the ground for the statement immediately preceding.
Gregory (p. 431) had suggested two alternatives:—1. That the soul dissolves with the body. This is answered by the soul’s
“incompositeness.” 2. That the union of the immaterial soul with the still material atoms after death cannot be maintained.
This is answered by the analogy given in the present section, of God’s presence in an uncongenial universe, and that of
the soul in the still living body. The γὰρ therefore refers to the answer to 1, without which the question of the soul continuing
in the atoms could not have been discussed at all.</note>

(Timæus, p. 69), whose use of this word for the body was afterwards followed, it is not clear whether a car or a
ship is most thought of, yet that the latter is Gregory’s meaning appears from his next words.</note>

however wide the interval is held to be which we observe between alien atoms. For instance,
there is a great difference between the buoyant and light as contrasted with the heavy and
solid; between the hot as contrasted with the cold; between the humid as contrasted with
its opposite; nevertheless it is no strain to an intelligent essence to be present in each of those
elements to which it has once cohered; this blending with opposites does not split it up. In
locality, in peculiar qualities, these elemental atoms are held to be far removed from each
other; but an undimensional nature finds it no labour to cling to what is locally divided,
seeing that even now it is possible for the mind at once to contemplate the heavens above
us and to extend its busy scrutiny beyond the horizon, nor is its contemplative power at all
distracted by these excursions into distances so great. There is nothing, then, to hinder the
soul’s presence in the body’s atoms, whether fused in union or decomposed in dissolution.
Just as in the amalgam of gold and silver a certain methodical force is to be observed which
has fused the metals, and if the one be afterwards smelted out of the other, the law of this
method nevertheless continues to reside in each, so that while the amalgam is separated this
method does not suffer division along with it (for you cannot make fractions out of the indivisible),
in the same way this intelligent essence of the soul is observable in the concourse
of the atoms, and does not undergo division when they are dissolved; but it remains with
them, and even in their separation it is co-extensive with them, yet not itself dissevered nor
discounted1780 into sections to accord with the number of the atoms. Such a condition belongs
to the material and spacial world, but that which is intelligent and undimensional is
not liable to the circumstances of space. Therefore the soul exists in the actual atoms which
she has once animated, and there is no force to tear her away from her cohesion with them.
What cause for melancholy, then, is there herein, that the visible is exchanged for the invisible;
and wherefore is it that your mind has conceived such a hatred of death?</p>
<p>Upon this I recurred to the definition which she had previously given of the soul, and
I said that to my thinking her definition had not indicated1781 distinctly enough all the
<note type="footnote">1780 κατακερματίζεται</note>
<note type="footnote">1781 ἐνδεδεῖχθαι. Gregory constantly uses ἐνδείκνυσθαι (middle) transitively, e.g. 202 C, 203 A, C, 208 B,
and above, 189 A, so that it is possible that we have here, in the passive form, a deponent (transitive) perfect;
moreover the sense seems to require it. Gregory objects that in what has been said all the powers which analysis
finds in the soul have not been set forth with sufficient fulness: an exhaustive account of them has not been
given; and he immediately proceeds to name other δυνάμεις and ἐνέργειαι which have not been taken into
consideration. That this view of the passage is correct is further shown by 202 C, where, the present objection
having been treated at length, it is concluded that there is no real ground for quarrelling with the definition of
soul ὡς ἐλλειπῶς ἐνδειξαμένῳ τὴν φύσιν. Krabinger therefore is right in dropping ἐννοουμένῳ, which two of
his mss. exhibit, and which Sifanus translates as governing τὰς…δυνάμεις, as if the sense were, “When I consider
all the powers of the soul, I do not think that your definition has been made good.”</note>

<pb n="817"/>
powers of the soul which are a matter of observation. It declares the soul to be an intellectual
essence which imparts to the organic body a force of life by which the senses operate. Now
the soul is not thus operative only in our scientific and speculative intellect; it does not
produce results in that world only, or employ the organs of sense only for this their natural
work. On the contrary, we observe in our nature many emotions of desire and many of anger;
and both these exist in us as qualities of our kind, and we see both of them in their manifestations
displaying further many most subtle differences. There are many states, for instance,
which are occasioned by desire; many others which on the other hand proceed from anger;
and none of them are of the body; but that which is not of the body is plainly intellectual.
Now1782 our definition exhibits the soul as something intellectual; so that one of two altern-
atives, both absurd, must emerge when we follow out this view to this end; either anger and
desire are both second souls in us, and a plurality of souls must take the place of the single
soul, or the thinking faculty in us cannot be regarded as a soul either (if they are not), the
intellectual element adhering equally to all of them and stamping them all as souls, or else
excluding every one of them equally from the specific qualities of soul.</p>
<p>You are quite justified, she replied, in raising this question, and it has ere this been discussed
by many elsewhere; namely, what we are to think of the principle of desire and the
principle of anger within us. Are they consubstantial with the soul, inherent in the soul’s
very self from her first organization1783, or are they something different, accruing to us afterwards?
In fact, while all equally allow that these principles are to be detected in the soul,
investigation has not yet discovered exactly what we are to think of them so as to gain some
fixed belief with regard to them. The generality of men still fluctuate in their opinions about
this, which are as erroneous as they are numerous. As for ourselves, if the Gentile philosophy,
which deals methodically with all these points, were really adequate for a demonstration, it
would certainly be superfluous to add1784 a discussion on the soul to those speculations.
<note type="footnote">1782 The syllogism implied in the following words is this:— The emotions are something intellectual (because
incorporeal). Therefore the emotions are soul (or souls). This conclusion is obviously false; logically, by reason of
the fallacy of “the undistributed middle”; ontologically, because it requires a false premise additional (i.e. “everything
intellectual is soul”) to make it true. Macrina directly after this piece of bad logic deprecates the use of the syllogism. Is
this accidental? It looks almost like an excuse for not going into technicalities and exposing this fallacy, which she has
detected in her opponent’s statement. Macrina actually answers as if Gregory had urged his objection thus. “The emotions
are not purely intellectual, but are conditioned by the bodily organism: but they do belong to the expression and the
substance of the soul: the soul therefore is dependent on the organism and will perish along with it.”</note>

But while the latter proceeded, on the subject of the soul, as far in the direction of supposed
consequences as the thinker pleased, we are not entitled to such licence, I mean that of affirming
what we please; we make the Holy Scriptures the rule and the measure of every
tenet; we necessarily fix our eyes upon that, and approve that alone which may be made to
harmonize with the intention of those writings. We must therefore neglect the Platonic
chariot and the pair of horses of dissimilar forces yoked to it, and their driver, whereby the
philosopher allegorizes these facts about the soul; we must neglect also all that is said by the
philosopher who succeeded him and who followed out probabilities by rules of art1785, and
diligently investigated the very question now before us, declaring that the soul was mortal1786
by reason of these two principles; we must neglect all before and since their time, whether
they philosophized in prose or in verse, and we will adopt, as the guide of our reasoning,
the Scripture, which lays it down as an axiom that there is no excellence in the soul which
is not a property as well of the Divine nature. For he who declares the soul to be God’s
likeness asserts that anything foreign to Him is outside the limits of the soul; similarity
cannot be retained in those qualities which are diverse from the original. Since, then, nothing
of the kind we are considering is included in the conception of the Divine nature, one would
be reasonable in surmising that such things are not consubstantial with the soul either. Now
to seek to build up our doctrine by rule of dialectic and the science which draws and destroys
conclusions, involves a species of discussion which we shall ask to be excused from, as being
<note type="footnote">1785 i.e.the syllogism.</note>
<note type="footnote">1786 that the soul was mortal. Aristotle, guided only by probabilities as discoverable by the syllogism, does
indeed define the soul, “the first entelechy of a physical, potentially living, and organic body.” Entelechy is more
than mere potentiality: it is “developed force” (“dormant activity;” see W. Archer Butler’s Lectures, ii. p. 393),
capable of manifestation. The human soul, uniting in itself all the faculties of the other orders of animate existence,
is a Microcosm. The other parts of the soul are inseparable from the body, and are hence perishable (De Animâ,
ii. 2); but the νοῦς exists before the body, into which it enters from without as something divine and immortal
(De Gen. Animal. ii. 3). But he makes a distinction between the form-receiving, and the form-giving νοῦς: substantial
eternal existence belongs only to the latter (De Animâ, iii. 5). The secret of the difference between him
and Plato, with whom “all the soul is immortal” (Phædrus, p. 245 C), lies in this; that Plato regarded the soul as
always in motion, while Aristotle denied it, in itself, any motion at all. “It is one of the things that are impossible
that motion should exist in it” (De Animâ, i. 4). It cannot be moved at all; therefore it cannot move itself. Plotinus
and Porphyry, as well as Nemesius the Platonizing Bishop of Emesa (whose treatise De Animâ is wrongly attributed
to Gregory), attacked this teaching of an “entelechy.” Cf. also Justin Martyr (ad Græc. cohort, c. 6, p. 12); “Plato
declares that all the soul is immortal; Aristotle calls her an ‘entelechy,’ and not immortal. The one says she is
ever-moving, the other that she is never-moving, but prior to all motion.” Also Gregory Naz., Orat. xxvii. “Away
with Aristotle’s calculating Providence, and his art of logic, and his dead reasonings about the soul, and purely
human doctrine!”</note>

a weak and questionable way of demonstrating truth. Indeed, it is clear to every one that
that subtle dialectic possesses a force that may be turned both ways, as well for the overthrow
of truth1787 as for the detection of falsehood; and so we begin to suspect even truth itself
when it is advanced in company with such a kind of artifice, and to think that the very ingenuity
of it is trying to bias our judgment and to upset the truth. If on the other hand any
one will accept a discussion which is in a naked unsyllogistic form, we will speak upon these
points by making our study of them so far as we can follow the chain1788 of Scriptural tradition.
What is it, then, that we assert? We say that the fact of the reasoning animal man
being capable of understanding and knowing is most surely1789 attested by those outside
our faith; and that this definition would never have sketched our nature so, if it had viewed
anger and desire and all such-like emotions as consubstantial with that nature. In any other
case, one would not give a definition of the subject in hand by putting a generic instead of
a specific quality; and so, as the principle of desire and the principle of anger are observed
equally in rational and irrational natures, one could not rightly mark the specific quality by
means of this generic one. But how can that which, in defining a nature, is superfluous and
worthy of exclusion be treated as a part of that nature, and, so, available for falsifying the
definition? Every definition of an essence looks to the specific quality of the subject in hand;
and whatever is outside that speciality is set aside as having nothing to do with the required
definition. Yet, beyond question, these faculties of anger and desire are allowed to be common
to all reasoning and brute natures; anything common is not identical with that which is
peculiar; it is imperative therefore that we should not range these faculties amongst those
whereby humanity is exclusively meant: but just as one may perceive the principle1790 of
sensation, and that of nutrition and growth in man, and yet not shake thereby the given
definition of his soul (for the quality A being in the soul does not prevent the quality B being
in it too), so, when one detects in humanity these emotions of anger and desire, one cannot
on that account fairly quarrel with this definition, as if it fell short of a full indication of
man’s nature.</p>
<p>What then, I asked the Teacher, are we to think about this? For I cannot yet see how
we can fitly repudiate faculties which are actually within us.</p>

be a different one.” Sleep, in which this power almost alone is active, levels all.</note>

<p>You see, she replied, there is a battle of the reason with them and a struggle to rid the
soul of them; and there are men in whom this struggle has ended in success; it was so with
Moses, as we know; he was superior both to anger and to desire; the history testifying of
him in both respects, that he was meek beyond all men (and by meekness it indicates the
absence of all anger and a mind quite devoid of resentment), and that he desired none of
those things about which we see the desiring faculty in the generality so active. This could
not have been so, if these faculties were nature, and were referable to the contents of man’s
essence1791. For it is impossible for one who has come quite outside of his nature to be in
Existence at all. But if Moses was at one and the same time in Existence and not in these
conditions, then1792 it follows that these conditions are something other than nature and
not nature itself. For if, on the one hand, that is truly nature in which the essence of the being
is found, and, on the other, the removal of these conditions is in our power, so that their
removal not only does no harm, but is even beneficial to the nature, it is clear that these
conditions are to be numbered amongst externals, and are affections, rather than the essence,
of the nature; for the essence is that thing only which it is. As for anger, most think it a fermenting
of the blood round the heart; others an eagerness to inflict pain in return for a
previous pain; we would take it to be the impulse to hurt one who has provoked us. But
none of these accounts of it tally with the definition of the soul. Again, if we were to define
what desire is in itself, we should call it a seeking for that which is wanting, or a longing for
pleasurable enjoyment, or a pain at not possessing that upon which the heart is set, or a
state with regard to some pleasure which there is no opportunity of enjoying. These and
such-like descriptions all indicate desire, but they have no connection with the definition
of the soul. But it is so with regard to all those other conditions also which we see to have
some relation to the soul, those, I mean, which are mutually opposed to each other, such as
cowardice and courage, pleasure and pain, fear and contempt, and so on; each of them seems
akin to the principle of desire or to that of anger, while they have a separate definition to
mark their own peculiar nature. Courage and contempt, for instance, exhibit a certain phase
of the irascible impulse; the dispositions arising from cowardice and fear exhibit on the
other hand a diminution and weakening of that same impulse. Pain, again, draws its material
both from anger and desire. For the impotence of anger, which consists in not being able
to punish one who has first given pain, becomes itself pain; and the despair of getting objects
of desire and the absence of things upon which the heart is set create in the mind this same
sullen state. Moreover, the opposite to pain, I mean the sensation of pleasure1793, like pain,

divides itself between anger and desire; for pleasure is the leading motive of them both. All
these conditions, I say, have some relation to the soul, and yet they are not the soul1794, but
only like warts growing out of the soul’s thinking part, which are reckoned as parts of it
because they adhere to it, and yet are not that actual thing which the soul is in its essence.</p>
<p>And yet, I rejoined to the virgin, we see no slight help afforded for improvement to the
virtuous from all these conditions. Daniel’s desire was his glory; and Phineas’ anger pleased
the Deity. We have been told, too, that fear is the beginning of wisdom, and learnt from
Paul that salvation is the goal of the “sorrow after a godly sort.” The Gospel bids us have a
contempt for danger; and the “not being afraid with any amazement” is nothing else but a
describing of courage, and this last is numbered by Wisdom amongst the things that are
good. In all this Scripture shows that such conditions are not to be considered weaknesses;
weaknesses would not have been so employed for putting virtue into practice.</p>
<p>I think, replied the Teacher, that I am myself responsible for this confusion arising from
different accounts of the matter; for I did not state it as distinctly as I might have, by introducing
a certain order of consequences for our consideration. Now, however, some such
order shall, as far as it is possible, be devised, so that our essay may advance in the way of
logical sequence and so give no room for such contradictions. We declare, then, that the
speculative, critical, and world-surveying faculty of the soul is its peculiar property by virtue
of its very nature1795, and that thereby the soul preserves within itself the image of the divine
grace; since our reason surmises that divinity itself, whatever it may be in its inmost nature,
is manifested in these very things,—universal supervision and the critical discernment
between good and evil. But all those elements of the soul which lie on the border-land1796
and are capable from their peculiar nature of inclining to either of two opposites (whose
eventual determination to the good or to the bad depends on the kind of use they are put
to), anger, for instance, and fear, and any other such-like emotion of the soul divested of
which human nature1797 cannot be studied—all these we reckon as accretions from without,
<note type="footnote">1794 have some relation to the soul, and yet they are not the soul. Macrina does not mean that the Passions
are altogether severed from the soul, as the following shows: and so Oehler cannot be right in reading and
translating “Das Alles hat nichts mir der Seele zu schaffen.” The Greek περὶ τὴν ψυχὴν is to be parallelled by οἱ
περὶ τὸν Περικλέα, “Pericles’ belongings,” or “party”; passing, in later Greek, almost into “Pericles himself.”</note>

that τῆς ψυχῆς should on the contrary be joined closely to ὅσα. The opposition is not between elements which

because in the Beauty which is man’s prototype no such characteristics are to be found. Now
let the following statement1798 be offered as a mere exercise (in interpretation). I pray that
it may escape the sneers of cavilling hearers. Scripture informs us that the Deity proceeded
by a sort of graduated and ordered advance to the creation of man. After the foundations
of the universe were laid, as the history records, man did not appear on the earth at once;
but the creation of the brutes preceded his, and the plants preceded them. Thereby Scripture
shows that the vital forces blended with the world of matter according to a gradation; first,
it infused itself into insensate nature; and in continuation of this advanced into the sentient
world; and then ascended to intelligent and rational beings. Accordingly, while all existing
things must be either corporeal or spiritual, the former are divided into the animate and
inanimate. By animate, I mean possessed of life: and of the things possessed of life, some
have it with sensation, the rest have no sensation. Again, of these sentient things, some have
reason, the rest have not. Seeing, then, that this life of sensation could not possibly exist
apart from the matter which is the subject of it, and the intellectual life could not be embodied,
either, without growing in the sentient, on this account the creation of man is related
as coming last, as of one who took up into himself every single form of life, both that of
plants and that which is seen in brutes. His nourishment and growth he derives from vegetable
life; for even in vegetables such processes are to be seen when aliment is being drawn
in by their roots and given off in fruit and leaves. His sentient organization he derives from
the brute creation. But his faculty of thought and reason is incommunicable1799, and is a
peculiar gift in our nature, to be considered by itself. However, just as this nature has the
instinct acquisitive of the necessaries to material existence—an instinct which, when mani-

best then to take διαφύγοι as a pure optative. Gregory appears in his answer to congratulate her on the success
of this “exercise.” “To any one that reflects…your exposition…bears sufficiently upon it the stamp of correctness,

Genesis, is not yet based upon Scripture. It is a “consecutive” and consistent account of human nature: but it is
virtually identical with that advanced at the end of Book I. of Aristotle’s Ethics. It is a piece of secular theorizing.
The sneers of cavillers may well be deprecated. Consistent, however, with this view of the λόγος here offered by

fested in us men, we call Appetite—and as we admit this appertains to the vegetable form
of life, since we can notice it there too like so many impulses working naturally to satisfy
themselves with their kindred aliment and to issue in germination, so all the peculiar conditions
of the brute creation are blended with the intellectual part of the soul. To them, she
continued, belongs anger; to them belongs fear; to them all those other opposing activities
within us; everything except the faculty of reason and thought. That alone, the choice product,
as has been said, of all our life, bears the stamp of the Divine character. But since, according
to the view which we have just enunciated, it is not possible for this reasoning faculty to
exist in the life of the body without existing by means of sensations, and since sensation is
already found subsisting in the brute creation, necessarily as it were, by reason of this one
condition, our soul has touch with the other things which are knit up with it1800; and these
are all those phænomena within us that we call “passions”; which have not been allotted to
human nature for any bad purpose at all (for the Creator would most certainly be the author
of evil, if in them, so deeply rooted as they are in our nature, any necessities of wrong-doing
were found), but according to the use which our free will puts them to, these emotions of
the soul become the instruments of virtue or of vice. They are like the iron which is being
fashioned according to the volition of the artificer, and receives whatever shape the idea
which is in his mind prescribes, and becomes a sword or some agricultural implement.
Supposing, then, that our reason, which is our nature’s choicest part, holds the dominion
over these imported emotions (as Scripture allegorically declares in the command to men
to rule over the brutes), none of them will be active in the ministry of evil; fear will only
generate within us obedience1801, and anger fortitude, and cowardice caution; and the instinct
of desire will procure for us the delight that is Divine and perfect. But if reason drops the
reins and is dragged behind like a charioteer who has got entangled in his car, then these
instincts are changed into fierceness, just as we see happens amongst the brutes. For since
reason does not preside over the natural impulses that are implanted1802 in them, the more
irascible animals, under the generalship of their anger, mutually destroy each other; while
the bulky and powerful animals get no good themselves from their strength, but become by
their want of reason slaves of that which has reason. Neither are the activities of their desire

each of them is transmuted to a form of virtue: for anger produces courage; terror, caution; fear, obedience;
hatred, aversion from vice; the power of love, the desire for what is truly beautiful, U+0026c.” Just below, the allusion

for pleasure employed on any of the higher objects; nor does any other instinct to be observed
in them result in any profit to themselves. Thus too, with ourselves, if these instincts are
not turned by reasoning into the right direction, and if our feelings get the mastery of our
mind, the man is changed from a reasoning into an unreasoning being, and from godlike
intelligence sinks by the force of these passions to the level of the brute.</p>
<p>Much moved by these words, I said: To any one who reflects indeed, your exposition,
advancing as it does in this consecutive manner, though plain and unvarnished, bears sufficiently
upon it the stamp of correctness and hits the truth. And to those who are expert only
in the technical methods of proof a mere demonstration suffices to convince; but as for
ourselves, we were agreed1803 that there is something more trustworthy than any of these
artificial conclusions, namely, that which the teachings of Holy Scripture point to: and so I
deem that it is necessary to inquire, in addition to what has been said, whether this inspired
teaching harmonizes with it all.</p>
<p>And who, she replied, could deny that truth is to be found only in that upon which the
seal of Scriptural testimony is set? So, if it is necessary that something from the Gospels
should be adduced in support of our view, a study of the Parable of the Wheat and Tares
will not be here out of place. The Householder there sowed good seed; (and we are plainly
the “house”). But the “enemy,” having watched for the time when men slept, sowed that
which was useless in that which was good for food, setting the tares in the very middle of
the wheat. The two kinds of seed grew up together; for it was not possible that seed put into
the very middle of the wheat should fail to grow up with it. But the Superintendent of the
field forbids the servants to gather up the useless crop, on account of their growing at the
very root of the contrary sort; so as not to root up1804 the nutritious along with that foreign
growth. Now we think that Scripture means by the good seed the corresponding impulses
of the soul, each one of which, if only they are cultured for good, necessarily puts forth the
fruit of virtue within us. But since there has been scattered1805 amongst these the bad seed
of the error of judgment as to the true Beauty which is alone in its intrinsic nature such, and
since this last has been thrown into the shade by the growth of delusion which springs up

along with it (for the active principle of desire does not germinate and increase in the direction
of that natural Beauty which was the object of its being sown in us, but it has changed
its growth so as to move towards a bestial and unthinking state, this very error as to Beauty
carrying its impulse towards this result; and in the same way the seed of anger does not steel
us to be brave, but only arms us to fight with our own people; and the power of loving deserts
its intellectual objects and becomes completely mad for the immoderate enjoyment of
pleasures of sense; and so in like manner our other affections put forth the worse instead
of the better growths),—on account of this the wise Husbandman leaves this growth that
has been introduced amongst his seed to remain there, so as to secure our not being altogether
stripped of better hopes by desire having been rooted out along with that good-fornothing
growth. If our nature suffered such a mutilation, what will there be to lift us up to
grasp the heavenly delights? If love is taken from us, how shall we be united to God? If anger
is to be extinguished, what arms shall we possess against the adversary? Therefore the
Husbandman leaves those bastard seeds within us, not for them always to overwhelm the
more precious crop, but in order that the land itself (for so, in his allegory, he calls the heart)
by its native inherent power, which is that of reasoning, may wither up the one growth and
may render the other fruitful and abundant: but if that is not done, then he commissions
the fire to mark the distinction in the crops. If, then, a man indulges these affections in a
due proportion and holds them in his own power instead of being held in theirs, employing
them for an instrument as a king does his subjects’ many hands, then efforts towards excellence
more easily succeed for him. But should he become theirs, and, as when any slaves
mutiny against their master, get enslaved1806 by those slavish thoughts and ignominiously
bow before them; a prey to his natural inferiors, he will be forced to turn to those employments
which his imperious masters command. This being so, we shall not pronounce these
emotions of the soul, which lie in the power of their possessors for good or ill, to be either
virtue or vice. But, whenever their impulse is towards what is noble, then they become
matter for praise, as his desire did to Daniel, and his anger to Phineas, and their grief to
those who nobly mourn. But if they incline to baseness, then these are, and they are called,
bad passions.</p>
<p>She ceased after this statement and allowed the discussion a short interval, in which I
reviewed mentally all that had been said; and reverting to that former course of proof in her
discourse, that it was not impossible that the soul after the body’s dissolution should reside
in its atoms, I again addressed her. Where is that much-talked-of and renowned Hades1807,
then? The word is in frequent circulation both in the intercourse of daily life, and in the

writings of the heathens and in our own; and all think that into it, as into a place of safekeeping,
souls migrate from here. Surely you would not call your atoms that Hades.</p>
<p>Clearly, replied the Teacher, you have not quite attended to the argument. In speaking
of the soul’s migration from the seen to the unseen, I thought I had omitted nothing as regards
the question about Hades. It seems to me that, whether in the heathen or in the Divine
writings, this word for a place in which souls are said to be means nothing else but a transition
to that Unseen world of which we have no glimpse.</p>
<p>And how, then, I asked, is it that some think that by the underworld1808 is meant an
actual place, and that it harbours within itself1809 the souls that have at last flitted away from
human life, drawing them towards itself as the right receptacle for such natures?</p>
<p>Well, replied the Teacher, our doctrine will be in no ways injured by such a supposition.
For if it is true, what you say1810, and also that the vault of heaven prolongs itself so uninterruptedly
that it encircles all things with itself, and that the earth and its surroundings are
poised in the middle, and that the motion of all the revolving bodies1811 is round this fixed
and solid centre, then, I say, there is an absolute necessity that, whatever may happen to
each one of the atoms on the upper side of the earth, the same will happen on the opposite
side, seeing that one single substance encompasses its entire bulk. As, when the sun shines
above the earth, the shadow is spread over its lower part, because its spherical shape makes
it impossible for it to be clasped all round at one and the same time by the rays, and necessarily,
on whatever side the sun’s rays may fall on some particular point of the globe, if we
follow a straight diameter, we shall find shadow upon the opposite point, and so, continu-
ously, at the opposite end of the direct line of the rays shadow moves round that globe,
keeping pace with the sun, so that equally in their turn both the upper half and the under
half of the earth are in light and darkness; so, by this analogy, we have reason to be certain
that, whatever in our hemisphere is observed to befall the atoms, the same will befall them
in that other. The environment of the atoms being one and the same on every side of the

earth, I deem it right neither to contradict nor yet to favour those who raise the objection
that we must regard either this or the lower region as assigned to the souls released. As long
as this objection does not shake our central doctrine of the existence of those souls after the
life in the flesh, there need be no controversy about the whereabouts to our mind, holding
as we do that place is a property of body only, and that soul, being immaterial, is by no necessity
of its nature detained in any place.</p>
<p>But what, I asked, if your opponent should shield himself1812 behind the Apostle, where
he says that every reasoning creature, in the restitution of all things, is to look towards Him
Who presides over the whole? In that passage in the Epistle to the Philippians1813 he makes
mention of certain things that are “under the earth” “every knee shall bow” to Him “of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”</p>
<p>We shall stand by our doctrine, answered the Teacher, even if we should hear them
adducing these words. For the existence of the soul (after death) we have the assent of our
opponent, and so we do not make an objection as to the place, as we have just said.</p>
<p>But if some were to ask the meaning of the Apostle in this utterance, what is one to say?
Would you remove all signification of place from the passage?</p>
<p>I do not think, she replied, that the divine Apostle divided the intellectual world into
localities, when he named part as in heaven, part as on earth, and part as under the earth.
There are three states in which reasoning creatures can be: one from the very first received
an immaterial life, and we call it the angelic: another is in union with the flesh, and we call
it the human: a third is released by death from fleshly entanglements, and is to be found in
souls pure and simple. Now I think that the divine Apostle in his deep wisdom looked to
this, when he revealed the future concord of all these reasoning beings in the work of
goodness; and that he puts the unembodied angel-world “in heaven,” and that still involved
with a body “on earth,” and that released from a body “under the earth”; or, indeed, if there
is any other world to be classed under that which is possessed of reason (it is not left out);
and whether any one choose to call this last “demons” or “spirits,” or anything else of the
kind, we shall not care. We certainly believe, both because of the prevailing opinion, and
still more of Scripture teaching, that there exists another world of beings besides, divested
of such bodies as ours are, who are opposed to that which is good and are capable of hurting
the lives of men, having by an act of will lapsed from the nobler view1814, and by this revolt

word, “lapsed,” is also Platonic.</note>

from goodness personified in themselves the contrary principle; and this world is what,
some say, the Apostle adds to the number of the “things under the earth,” signifying in that
passage that when evil shall have been some day annihilated in the long revolutions of the
ages, nothing shall be left outside the world of goodness, but that even from those evil spirits1815
shall rise in harmony the confession of Christ’s Lordship. If this is so, then no one
can compel us to see any spot of the underworld in the expression, “things under the earth”;
the atmosphere spreads equally over every part of the earth, and there is not a single corner
of it left unrobed by this circumambient air.</p>
<p>When she had finished, I hesitated a moment, and then said: I am not yet satisfied about
the thing which we have been inquiring into; after all that has been said my mind is still in
doubt; and I beg that our discussion may be allowed to revert to the same line of reasoning
as before1816, omitting only that upon which we are thoroughly agreed. I say this, for I think
that all but the most stubborn controversialists will have been sufficiently convinced by our
debate not to consign the soul after the body’s dissolution to annihilation and nonentity,
nor to argue that because it differs substantially from the atoms it is impossible for it to exist
anywhere in the universe; for, however much a being that is intellectual and immaterial may
fail to coincide with these atoms, it is in no ways hindered (so far) from existing in them;
and this belief of ours rests on two facts: firstly, on the soul’s existing in our bodies in this
present life, though fundamentally different from them: and secondly, on the fact that the

who declares that the Powers of evil are for a purpose (in answer to Celsus’ objection that the Devil himself, instead
of humanity, ought to have been punished). “Now it is a thing which can in no way cause surprise, that the
Almighty, Who knows how to use wicked apostates for His own purposes, should assign to such a certain place
in the universe, and should thus open an arena, as it were, of virtue, for those to contend in who wish to “strive
lawfully” for her prize: those wicked ones were to try them, as the fire tries the gold, that, having done their utmost
to prevent the admission of any alloy into their spiritual nature, and having proved themselves worthy to mount
to heaven, they might be drawn by the bands of the Word to the highest blessedness and the summit of all Good.”
These Powers, as reasoning beings, shall then themselves be “mastered by the Word.” See c. Cels. viii. 72.</note>

once animated, and there is no force to tear her away from her cohesion with them.” It is to the line of reasoning
(ἀκολουθία) leading up to this conclusion that Gregory would revert, in order to question this conclusion. What
both sides are agreed on is, the existence merely of the soul after death. All between this conclusion and the
present break in the discussion has been a digression on the Passions and on Hades. Now Gregory asks, how
can the soul possibly recognize the atoms that once belonged to her? Oehler therefore does not translate aright,
“ich bitte nur den geführten Beweis…in derselben Folge zu wiederholen:” but Krabinger expresses the true
sense, “ut rursus mihi ad eandem consequentiam reducatur oratio,” i.e. the discussion (not the proof), which is
here again, almost in Platonic fashion, personified.</note>

<pb n="829"/>
Divine being, as our argument has shown, though distinctly something other than visible
and material substances, nevertheless pervades each one amongst all existences, and by this
penetration of the whole keeps the world in a state of being; so that following these analogies
we need not think that the soul, either, is out of existence, when she passes from the world
of forms to the Unseen. But how, I insisted, after the united whole of the atoms has assumed1817,
owing to their mixing together, a form quite different—the form in fact with
which the soul has been actually domesticated—by what mark, when this form, as we should
have expected, is effaced along with the resolution of the atoms, shall the soul follow along
(them), now that that familiar form ceases to persist?</p>
<p>She waited a moment and then said: Give me leave to invent a fanciful simile in order
to illustrate the matter before us: even though that which I suppose may be outside the range
of possibility. Grant it possible, then, in the art of painting not only to mix opposite colours,
as painters are always doing, to represent a particular tint1818, but also to separate again this
mixture and to restore to each of the colours its natural dye. If then white, or black, or red,
or golden colour, or any other colour that has been mixed to form the given tint, were to
be again separated from that union with another and remain by itself, we suppose that our
artist will none the less remember the actual nature of that colour, and that in no case will
he show forgetfulness, either of the red, for instance, or the black, if after having become
quite a different colour by composition with each other they each return to their natural
dye. We suppose, I say, that our artist remembers the manner of the mutual blending of
these colours, and so knows what sort of colour was mixed with a given colour and what
sort of colour was the result, and how, the other colour being ejected from the composition,
(the original colour) in consequence of such release resumed its own peculiar hue; and,
supposing it were required to produce the same result again by composition, the process
will be all the easier from having been already practised in his previous work. Now, if reason
can see any analogy in this simile, we must search the matter in hand by its light. Let the
<note type="footnote">1817 has assumed, ἀναλαβόντων. The construction is accommodated to the sense, not the words; τῆς τῶν
στοιχείων ἑνώσεως having preceded.</note>
<note type="footnote">1818 tint, μορφῆς. Certainly in earlier Greek μορφὴ is strictly used of “form,” “shape” (or the beauty of it)
only, and colours cannot be said to be mixed in imitation of form. It seems we have here a late use of μορφὴ as
= “outward appearance”; so that we may even speak of the μορφὴ of a colour, or combinations of colours. So
(214 A) the painter “works up (on his palette) a particular tint of colour” (μορφὴν). Here it is the particular hue,
in person or picture, which it is desired to imitate. Akin to this question is that of the proper translation of πρὸς
τὴν ὁμοιότητα τοῦ προκειμένου, which Sifanus and Krabinger translate “ad similitudinem argumenti,” and
which may either mean (1) “to make the analogy to the subject matter of our question as perfect as possible,”
i.e. as a parenthesis, or (2) “in imitation of the thing or colour (lying before the painter) to be copied.” The last
seems preferable (“to form the given tint”).</note>

<pb n="830"/>
soul stand for this Art of the painter1819; and let the natural atoms stand for the colours of
his art; and let the mixture of that tint compounded of the various dyes, and the return of
these to their native state (which we have been allowed to assume), represent respectively
the concourse, and the separation of the atoms. Then, as we assume in the simile that the
painter’s Art tells him the actual dye of each colour, when it has returned after mixing to
its proper hue, so that he has an exact knowledge of the red, and of the black, and of any
other colour that went to form the required tint by a specific way of uniting with another
kind—a knowledge which includes its appearance both in the mixture, and now when it is
in its natural state, and in the future again, supposing all the colours were mixed over again
in like fashion—so, we assert, does the soul know the natural peculiarities of those atoms
whose concourse makes the frame of the body in which it has itself grown, even after the
scattering of those atoms. However far from each other their natural propensity and their
inherent forces of repulsion urge them, and debar each from mingling with its opposite,
none the less will the soul be near each by its power of recognition, and will persistently
cling to the familiar atoms, until their concourse after this division again takes place in the
same way, for that fresh formation of the dissolved body which will properly be, and be
called, resurrection.</p>
<p>You seem, I interrupted, in this passing remark to have made an excellent defence of
the faith in the Resurrection. By it, I think, the opponents of this doctrine might be gradually
led to consider it not as a thing absolutely impossible that the atoms should again coalesce
and form the same man as before.</p>
<p>That is very true, the Teacher replied. For we may hear these opponents urging the fol-
lowing difficulty. “The atoms are resolved, like to like, into the universe; by what device,
then, does the warmth, for instance, residing in such and such a man, after joining the universal
warmth, again dissociate itself from this connection with its kindred1820, so as to
form this man who is being ‘remoulded’? For if the identical individual particle does not
return and only something that is homogeneous but not identical is fetched, you will have
something else in the place of that first thing, and such a process will cease to be a resurrection
and will be merely the creation of a new man. But if the same man is to return into himself,

than Oehler, opposes ἐν τῷδε to ἐν τῷ καθ᾽ ὅλου (quod est hic calidum, si fuerit in universo): though neither
he, nor Oehler, nor Schmidt himself appears to have any suspicion that τῷδε maymean “so and so:” and yet it
is quite in accordance with Gregory’s usage, and makes better sense, as contrasting the particular and universal
heat more completely. ᾽Αμιγὲς is proleptic: the genitive may depend either on it or on the verb. Just below

he must be the same entirely, and regain his original formation in every single atom of his
elements.”</p>
<p>Then to meet such an objection, I rejoined, the above opinion about the soul will, as I
said, avail; namely, that she remains after dissolution in those very atoms in which she first
grew up, and, like a guardian placed over private property, does not abandon them when
they are mingled with their kindred atoms, and by the subtle ubiquity of her intelligence
makes no mistake about them, with all their subtle minuteness, but diffuses herself along
with those which belong to herself when they are being mingled with their kindred dust,
and suffers no exhaustion in keeping up with the whole number of them when they stream
back into the universe, but remains with them, no matter in what direction or in what
fashion Nature may arrange them. But should the signal be given by the All-disposing Power
for these scattered atoms to combine again, then, just as when every one of the various ropes
that hang from one block answer at one and the same moment1821 to the pull from that
centre, so, following this force of the soul which acts upon the various atoms, all these, once
so familiar with each other, rush simultaneously together and form the cable of the body
by means of the soul, each single one of them being wedded to its former neighbour and
embracing an old acquaintance.</p>
<p>The following illustration also, the Teacher went on, might be very properly added to
those already brought forward, to show that the soul has not need of much teaching in order
to distinguish its own from the alien amongst the atoms. Imagine a potter with a supply of
clay; and let the supply be a large one; and let part of it have been already moulded to form
finished vessels, while the rest is still waiting to be moulded; and suppose the vessels themselves
not to be all of similar shape, but one to be a jug, for instance, and another a winejar,
another a plate, another a cup or any other useful vessel; and further, let not one owner
possess them all, but let us fancy for each a special owner. Now as long as these vessels are
unbroken they are of course recognizable by their owners, and none the less so, even should
they be broken in pieces; for from those pieces each will know, for instance, that this belongs
to a jar1822, and, again, what sort of fragment belongs to a cup. And if they are plunged
again into the unworked clay, the discernment between what has been already worked and
that clay will be a more unerring one still. The individual man is as such a vessel; he has
been moulded out of the universal matter, owing to the concourse of his atoms; and he exhibits
in a form peculiarly his own a marked distinction from his kind; and when that form
has gone to pieces the soul that has been mistress of this particular vessel will have an exact
knowledge of it, derived even from its fragments; nor will she leave this property, either, in
the common blending with all the other fragments, or if it be plunged into the still formless

part of the matter from which the atoms have come1823; she always remembers her own as
it was when compact in bodily form, and after dissolution she never makes any mistake
about it, led by marks still clinging to the remains.</p>
<p>I applauded this as well devised to bring out the natural features of the case before us;
and I said: It is very well to speak like this and to believe that it is so; but suppose some one
were to quote against it our Lord’s narrative about those who are in hell, as not harmonizing
with the results of our inquiry, how are we to be prepared with an answer?</p>
<p>The Teacher answered: The expressions of that narrative of the Word are certainly
material; but still many hints are interspersed in it to rouse the skilled inquirer to a more
discriminating study of it. I mean that He Who parts the good from the bad by a great gulf,
and makes the man in torment crave for a drop to be conveyed by a finger, and the man
who has been ill-treated in this life rest on a patriarch’s bosom, and Who relates their previous
death and consignment to the tomb, takes an intelligent searcher of His meaning far beyond
a superficial interpretation. For what sort of eyes has the Rich Man to lift up in hell, when
he has left his bodily eyes in that tomb? And how can a disembodied spirit feel any flame?
And what sort of tongue can he crave to be cooled with the drop of water, when he has lost
his tongue of flesh? What is the finger that is to convey to him this drop? What sort of place
is the “bosom” of repose? The bodies of both of them are in the tomb, and their souls are
disembodied, and do not consist of parts either; and so it is impossible to make the framework
of the narrative correspond with the truth, if we understand it literally; we can do that only
by translating each detail into an equivalent in the world of ideas. Thus we must think of
the gulf as that which parts ideas which may not be confounded from running together, not
as a chasm of the earth. Such a chasm, however vast it were, could be traversed with no difficulty
by a disembodied intelligence; since intelligence can in no time1824 be wherever it
will.</p>
<p>What then, I asked, are the fire and the gulf and the other features in the picture? Are
they not that which they are said to be?</p>
<p>I think, she replied, that the Gospel signifies by means of each of them certain doctrines
with regard to our question of the soul. For when the patriarch first says to the Rich Man,
“Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things,” and in the same way speaks of the Poor
Man, that he, namely, has done his duty in bearing his share of life’s evil things, and then,
after that, adds with regard to the gulf that it is a barrier between them, he evidently by such
expressions intimates a very important truth; and, to my thinking, it is as follows. Once
man’s life had but one character; and by that I mean that it was to be found only in the cat-
<note type="footnote">1823 πρὸς τὸ ἀκατέργαστον τῆς τῶν στοιχείων ὕλης. There is the same sort of distinction above, 215 A, i.e.

<pb n="833"/>
egory of the good and had no contact with evil. The first of God’s commandments attests
the truth of this; that, namely, which gave to man unstinted enjoyment of all the blessings
of Paradise, forbidding only that which was a mixture of good and evil and so composed of
contraries, but making death the penalty for transgressing in that particular. But man, acting
freely by a voluntary impulse, deserted the lot that was unmixed with evil, and drew upon
himself that which was a mixture of contraries. Yet Divine Providence did not leave that
recklessness of ours without a corrective. Death indeed, as the fixed penalty for breaking
the law, necessarily fell upon its transgressors; but God divided the life of man into two
parts, namely, this present life, and that “out of the body” hereafter; and He placed on the
first a limit of the briefest possible time, while He prolonged the other into eternity; and in
His love for man He gave him his choice, to have the one or the other of those things, good
or evil, I mean, in which of the two parts he liked: either in this short and transitory life, or
in those endless ages, whose limit is infinity. Now these expressions “good” and “evil” are
equivocal; they are used in two senses, one relating to mind and the other to sense; some
classify as good whatever is pleasant to feeling: others are confident that only that which is
perceptible by intelligence is good and deserves that name. Those, then, whose reasoning
powers have never been exercised and who have never had a glimpse of the better way soon
use up on gluttony in this fleshly life the dividend of good which their constitution can
claim, and they reserve none of it for the after life; but those who by a discreet and soberminded
calculation economize the powers of living are afflicted by things painful to sense
here, but they reserve their good for the succeeding life, and so their happier lot is lengthened
out to last as long as that eternal life. This, in my opinion, is the “gulf”; which is not made
by the parting of the earth, but by those decisions in this life which result in a separation
into opposite characters. The man who has once chosen pleasure in this life, and has not
cured his inconsiderateness by repentance, places the land of the good beyond his own
reach; for he has dug against himself the yawning impassable abyss of a necessity that
nothing can break through. This is the reason, I think, that the name of Abraham’s bosom
is given to that good situation of the soul in which Scripture makes the athlete of endurance
repose. For it is related of this patriarch first, of all up to that time born, that he exchanged
the enjoyment of the present for the hope of the future; he was stripped of all the surroundings
in which his life at first was passed, and resided amongst foreigners, and thus purchased
by present annoyance future blessedness. As then figuratively1825 we call a particular circuit
of the ocean a “bosom,” so does Scripture seem to me to express the idea of those measureless
blessings above by the word “bosom,” meaning a place into which all virtuous voyagers of
this life are, when they have put in from hence, brought to anchor in the waveless harbour
<note type="footnote">1825 ἐκ καταχρήσεώς τινος: not as usually “by a misuse of words.”</note>

<pb n="834"/>
of that gulf of blessings1826. Meanwhile the denial of these blessings which they witness becomes
in the others a flame, which burns the soul and causes the craving for the refreshment
of one drop out of that ocean of blessings wherein the saints are affluent; which nevertheless
they do not get. If, too, you consider the “tongue,” and the “eye,” and the “finger,” and the
other names of bodily organs, which occur in the conversation between those disembodied
souls, you will be persuaded that this conjecture of ours about them chimes in with the
opinion we have already stated about the soul. Look closely into the meaning of those words.
For as the concourse of atoms forms the substance of the entire body, so it is reasonable to
think that the same cause operates to complete the substance of each member of the body.
If, then, the soul is present with the atoms of the body when they are again mingled with
the universe, it will not only be cognizant of the entire mass which once came together to
form the whole body, and will be present with it, but, besides that, will not fail to know the
particular materials of each one of the members, so as to remember by what divisions
amongst the atoms our limbs were completely formed. There is, then, nothing improbable
in supposing that what is present in the complete mass is present also in each division of
the mass. If one, then, thinks of those atoms in which each detail of the body potentially
inheres, and surmises that Scripture means a “finger” and a “tongue” and an “eye” and the
rest as existing, after dissolution, only in the sphere of the soul, one will not miss the probable
truth. Moreover, if each detail carries the mind away from a material acceptation of the
story, surely the “hell” which we have just been speaking of cannot reasonably be thought
a place so named; rather we are there told by Scripture about a certain unseen and immaterial
situation in which the soul resides. In this story of the Rich and the Poor Man we are
taught another doctrine also, which is intimately connected with our former discoveries.
The story makes the sensual pleasure-loving man, when he sees that his own case is one that
admits of no escape, evince forethought for his relations on earth; and when Abraham tells
him that the life of those still in the flesh is not unprovided with a guidance, for they may
find it at hand, if they will, in the Law and the Prophets, he still continues entreating that
Just1827 Patriarch, and asks that a sudden and convincing message, brought by some one
risen from the dead, may be sent to them.</p>
<p>What then, I asked, is the doctrine here?</p>
<p>Why, seeing that Lazarus’ soul is occupied1828 with his present blessings and turns
round to look at nothing that he has left, while the rich man is still attached, with a cement

as it were, even after death, to the life of feeling, which he does not divest himself of even
when he has ceased to live, still keeping as he does flesh and blood in his thoughts (for in
his entreaty that his kindred may be exempted from his sufferings he plainly shows that he
is not freed yet from fleshly feeling),—in such details of the story (she continued) I think
our Lord teaches us this; that those still living in the flesh must as much as ever they can
separate and free themselves in a way from its attachments by virtuous conduct, in order
that after death they may not need a second death to cleanse them from the remnants that
are owing to this cement1829 of the flesh, and, when once the bonds are loosed from around
the soul, her soaring1830 up to the Good may be swift and unimpeded, with no anguish of
the body to distract her. For if any one becomes wholly and thoroughly carnal in thought,
such an one, with every motion and energy of the soul absorbed in fleshly desires, is not
parted from such attachments, even in the disembodied state; just as those who have lingered
long in noisome places do not part with the unpleasantness contracted by that lengthened
stay, even when they pass into a sweet atmosphere. So1831 it is that, when the change is made
into the impalpable Unseen, not even then will it be possible for the lovers of the flesh to
avoid dragging away with them under any circumstances some fleshly foulness; and thereby
their torment will be intensified, their soul having been materialized by such surroundings.
I think too that this view of the matter harmonizes to a certain extent with the assertion
made by some persons that around their graves shadowy phantoms of the departed are often
seen1832. If this is really so, an inordinate attachment of that particular soul to the life in the

<note type="footnote">1830 her soaring. Plato first spoke (Phædrus, p. 248 C) of “that growth of wing, by which the soul is lifted.”
Once these natural wings can get expanded, her flight upwards is a matter of course. This image is reproduced
by Plotinus p. 769 A (end of Enneads); Libanius, Pro Socrate, p. 258; Synesius, De Providentiâ, p. 90 D, and
Hymn i. III, where he speaks of the ἅλμα κοῦφον of the soul, and Hymn iii. 42. But there is mixed here with the
idea of a flight upwards (i.e. ἀναδρομὴ), that of the running-ground as well (cf. Greg. De scopo Christian. III. p.
299, τοῖς τῆς ἀρετῆς δρόμοις), which, as sanctioned in the New Testament, Chrysostom so often uses.</note>
<note type="footnote">1831 οὕτως answers to καθάπερ, not to ὡς above.</note>
<note type="footnote">1832 shadowy phantoms of the departed are often seen. Cf. Origen c. Cels. ii. 60 (in answer to Celsus’ “Epicurean”
opinion that ghosts are pure illusion): “He who does believe this (i.e. in ghosts) necessarily believes in the immortality,
or at all events the long continuance of the soul: as Plato does in his treatise on the soul (i.e. the Phædo)
when he says that the shadowy apparitions of the dead hover round their tombs. These apparitions, then, have
some substance: it is the so-called ‘radiant’ frame in which the soul exists. But Celsus, not liking this, would have
us believe that people have waking dreams and ‘imagine as true, in accordance with their wishes, a wild piece
of unreality.’ In sleep we may well believe that this is the case: not so in waking hours, unless some one is quite
out of his senses, or is melancholy mad.” But Origen here quotes Plato in connection with the reality of the Re-</note>

flesh is proved to have existed, causing it to be unwilling, even when expelled from the flesh,
to fly clean away and to admit the complete change of its form into the impalpable; it remains
near the frame even after the dissolution of the frame, and though now outside it, hovers
regretfully over the place where its material is and continues to haunt it.</p>
<p>Then, after a moment’s reflection on the meaning of these latter words, I said: I think
that a contradiction now arises between what you have said and the result of our former
examination of the passions. For if, on the one hand, the activity of such movements within
us is to be held as arising from our kinship with the brutes, such movements I mean as were
enumerated in our previous discussion1833, anger, for instance, and fear, desire of pleasure,
and so on, and, on the other hand, it was affirmed that virtue consists in the good employment
of these movements, and vice in their bad employment, and in addition to this we
discussed the actual contribution of each of the other passions to a virtuous life, and found
that through desire above all we are brought nearer God, drawn up, by its chain as it were,
from earth towards Him,—I think (I said) that that part of the discussion is in a way opposed
to that which we are now aiming at.</p>
<p>How so? she asked.</p>
<p>Why, when every unreasoning instinct is quenched within us after our purgation, this
principle of desire will not exist any more than the other principles; and this being removed,
it looks as if the striving after the better way would also cease, no other emotion remaining
in the soul that can stir us up to the appetence of Good.</p>
<p>To that objection, she replied, we answer this. The speculative and critical faculty is the
property of the soul’s godlike part; for it is by these that we grasp the Deity also. If, then
whether by forethought here, or by purgation hereafter, our soul becomes free from any
emotional connection with the brute creation, there will be nothing to impede its contemplation
of the Beautiful; for this last is essentially capable of attracting in a certain way every
being that looks towards it. If, then, the soul is purified of every vice, it will most certainly
be in the sphere of Beauty. The Deity is in very substance Beautiful; and to the Deity the
soul will in its state of purity have affinity, and will embrace It as like itself. Whenever this
happens, then, there will be no longer need of the impulse of Desire to lead the way to the
Beautiful. Whoever passes his time in darkness, he it is who will be under the influence of
a desire for the light; but whenever he comes into the light, then enjoyment takes the place
of desire, and the power to enjoy renders desire useless and out of date. It will therefore be
no detriment to our participation in the Good, that the soul should be free from such emotions,
and turning back upon herself should know herself accurately what her actual nature
<note type="footnote">surrection body of Christ: Gregory refers to ghosts only, with regard to the φιλοσώματοι, whose whole condition
after death he represents very much in Plato’s words. See Phædo, p. 81 B.</note>

<pb n="837"/>
is, and should behold the Original Beauty reflected in the mirror and in the figure of her
own beauty. For truly herein consists the real assimilation to the Divine; viz. in making our
own life in some degree a copy of the Supreme Being. For a Nature like that, which transcends
all thought and is far removed from all that we observe within ourselves, proceeds in its
existence in a very different manner to what we do in this present life. Man, possessing a
constitution whose law it is to be moving, is carried in that particular direction whither the
impulse of his will directs: and so his soul is not affected in the same way towards what lies
before it1834, as one may say, as to what it has left behind; for hope leads the forward
movement, but it is memory that succeeds that movement when it has advanced to the attainment
of the hope; and if it is to something intrinsically good that hope thus leads on the
soul, the print that this exercise of the will leaves upon the memory is a bright one; but if
hope has seduced the soul with some phantom only of the Good, and the excellent Way has
been missed, then the memory that succeeds what has happened becomes shame, and an
intestine war is thus waged in the soul between memory and hope, because the last has been
such a bad leader of the will. Such in fact is the state of mind that shame gives expression
to; the soul is stung as it were at the result; its remorse for its ill-considered attempt is a whip
that makes it feel to the quick, and it would bring in oblivion to its aid against its tormentor.
Now in our case nature, owing to its being indigent of the Good, is aiming always at this
which is still wanting to it, and this aiming at a still missing thing is this very habit of Desire,
which our constitution displays equally, whether it is baulked of the real Good, or wins that
which it is good to win. But a nature that surpasses every idea that we can form of the Good
and transcends all other power, being in no want of anything that can be regarded as good,
is itself the plenitude of every good; it does not move in the sphere of the good by way of
participation in it only, but it is itself the substance of the Good (whatever we imagine the
Good to be); it neither gives scope for any rising hope (for hope manifests activity in the
direction of something absent; but “what a man has, why doth he yet hope for?” as the
Apostle asks), nor is it in want of the activity of the memory for the knowledge of things;
that which is actually seen has no need of being remembered. Since, then, this Divine nature
is beyond any particular good1835, and to the good the good is an object of love, it follows
that when It looks within Itself1836, It wishes for what It contains and contains that which
It wishes, and admits nothing external. Indeed there is nothing external to It, with the sole
exception of evil, which, strange as it may seem to say, possesses an existence in not existing
<note type="footnote">1834 κατὰ το ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῆς.</note>
<note type="footnote">1835 any particular good, not as Oehler, “jenseits alles Guten.” The Divine Being is the complement, not the
negation, of each single good.</note>

Codd.</note>

<pb n="838"/>
at all. For there is no other origin of evil except the negation of the existent, and the trulyexistent
forms the substance of the Good. That therefore which is not to be found in the
existent must be in the non-existent. Whenever the soul, then, having divested itself of the
multifarious emotions incident to its nature, gets its Divine form and, mounting above
Desire, enters within that towards which it was once incited by that Desire, it offers no
harbour within itself either for hope or for memory. It holds the object of the one; the other
is extruded from the consciousness by the occupation in enjoying all that is good: and thus
the soul copies the life that is above, and is conformed to the peculiar features of the Divine
nature; none of its habits are left to it except that of love, which clings by natural affinity to
the Beautiful. For this is what love is; the inherent affection towards a chosen object. When,
then, the soul, having become simple and single in form and so perfectly godlike, finds that
perfectly simple and immaterial good which is really worth enthusiasm and love1837, it attaches
itself to it and blends with it by means of the movement and activity of love, fashioning
itself according to that which it is continually finding and grasping. Becoming by this assimilation
to the Good all that the nature of that which it participates is, the soul will consequently,
owing to there being no lack of any good in that thing itself which it participates,
be itself also in no lack of anything, and so will expel from within the activity and the habit
of Desire; for this arises only when the thing missed is not found. For this teaching we have
the authority of God’s own Apostle, who announces a subduing1838 and a ceasing of all
other activities, even for the good, which are within us, and finds no limit for love alone.
Prophecies, he says, shall fail; forms of knowledge shall cease; but “charity never faileth;”
which is equivalent to its being always as it is: and though1839 he says that faith and hope
have endured so far by the side of love, yet again he prolongs its date beyond theirs, and
with good reason too; for hope is in operation only so long as the enjoyment of the things
hoped for is not to be had; and faith in the same way is a support1840 in the uncertainty
about the things hoped for; for so he defines it—“the substance1841 of things hoped for”;
but when the thing hoped for actually comes, then all other faculties are reduced to quiescence1842,
and love alone remains active, finding nothing to succeed itself. Love, therefore,

is the foremost of all excellent achievements and the first of the commandments of the law.
If ever, then, the soul reach this goal, it will be in no need of anything else; it will embrace
that plenitude of things which are, whereby alone1843 it seems in any way to preserve within
itself the stamp of God’s actual blessedness. For the life of the Supreme Being is love, seeing
that the Beautiful is necessarily lovable to those who recognize it, and the Deity does recognize
it, and so this recognition becomes love, that which He recognizes being essentially beautiful.
This True Beauty the insolence of satiety cannot touch1844; and no satiety interrupting this
continuous capacity to love the Beautiful, God’s life will have its activity in love; which life
is thus in itself beautiful, and is essentially of a loving disposition towards the Beautiful, and
receives no check to this activity of love. In fact, in the Beautiful no limit is to be found so
that love should have to cease with any limit of the Beautiful. This last can be ended only
by its opposite; but when you have a good, as here, which is in its essence incapable of a
change for the worse, then that good will go on unchecked into infinity. Moreover, as every
being is capable of attracting its like, and humanity is, in a way, like God, as bearing within
itself some resemblances to its Prototype, the soul is by a strict necessity attracted to the
kindred Deity. In fact what belongs to God must by all means and at any cost be preserved
for Him. If, then, on the one hand, the soul is unencumbered with superfluities and no
trouble connected with the body presses it down, its advance towards Him Who draws it
to Himself is sweet and congenial. But suppose1845, on the other hand, that it has been
transfixed with the nails of propension1846 so as to be held down to a habit connected with
material things,—a case like that of those in the ruins caused by earthquakes, whose bodies
are crushed by the mounds of rubbish; and let us imagine by way of illustration that these

“Then this proves to be nonsense what Origen has imagined about the satiety of minds, and their consequent

are always revolving in endless motion, determined as he is, like a retailer of evil, to mingle the Grecian myths
with the Church’s truth.” Gregory, more sober in his idealism, certainly does not follow on this point his great
Master. The phrase ὑβριστὴς κόρος is used by Gregory Naz. also in his Poems (p. 32 A), and may have been
suggested to both by some poet, now lost. “Familiarity breeds contempt” is the modern equivalent.</note>

are not only pressed down by the weight of the ruins, but have been pierced as well with
some spikes and splinters discovered with them in the rubbish. What then, would naturally
be the plight of those bodies, when they were being dragged by relatives from the ruins to
receive the holy rites of burial, mangled and torn entirely, disfigured in the most direful
manner conceivable, with the nails beneath the heap harrowing them by the very violence
necessary to pull them out?—Such I think is the plight of the soul as well when the Divine
force, for God’s very love of man, drags that which belongs to Him from the ruins of the
irrational and material. Not in hatred or revenge for a wicked life, to my thinking, does God
bring upon sinners those painful dispensations; He is only claiming and drawing to Himself
whatever, to please Him, came into existence. But while He for a noble end is attracting the
soul to Himself, the Fountain of all Blessedness, it is the occasion necessarily to the being
so attracted of a state of torture. Just as those who refine gold from the dross which it contains
not only get this base alloy to melt in the fire, but are obliged to melt the pure gold along
with the alloy, and then while this last is being consumed the gold remains, so, while evil is
being consumed in the purgatorial1847 fire, the soul that is welded to this evil must inevitably
be in the fire too, until the spurious material alloy is consumed and annihilated by this fire.

the rope is put through a narrow hole, and then some one on the further side violently pulls
it by that end, the result must be that, while the rope itself obeys the force exerted, the clay
that has been plastered upon it is scraped off it with this violent pulling and is left outside
the hole, and, moreover, is the cause why the rope does not run easily through the passage,
but has to undergo a violent tension at the hands of the puller. In such a manner, I think,
we may figure to ourselves the agonized struggle of that soul which has wrapped itself up
in earthy material passions, when God is drawing it, His own one, to Himself, and the foreign
matter, which has somehow grown into its substance, has to be scraped from it by main
force, and so occasions it that keen intolerable anguish.</p>
<p>Then it seems, I said, that it is not punishment chiefly and principally that the Deity, as
Judge, afflicts sinners with; but He operates, as your argument has shown, only to get the
good separated from the evil and to attract it into the communion of blessedness.</p>
<p>That, said the Teacher, is my meaning; and also that the agony will be measured by the
amount of evil there is in each individual. For it would not be reasonable to think that the
man who has remained so long as we have supposed in evil known to be forbidden, and the

man who has fallen only into moderate sins, should be tortured to the same amount in the
judgment upon their vicious habit; but according to the quantity of material will be the
longer or shorter time that that agonizing flame will be burning; that is, as long as there is
fuel to feed it. In the case of the man who has acquired a heavy weight of material, the consuming
fire must necessarily be very searching; but where that which the fire has to feed
upon1848 has spread less far, there the penetrating fierceness of the punishment is mitigated,
so far as the subject itself, in the amount of its evil, is diminished. In any and every case evil
must be removed out of existence, so that, as we said above, the absolutely non-existent
should cease to be at all. Since it is not in its nature that evil should exist outside the will,
does it not follow that when it shall be that every will rests in God, evil will be reduced to
complete annihilation, owing to no receptacle being left for it?</p>
<p>But, said I, what help can one find in this devout hope, when one considers the greatness
of the evil in undergoing torture even for a single year; and if that intolerable anguish be
prolonged for the interval of an age, what grain of comfort is left from any subsequent expectation
to him whose purgation is thus commensurate with an entire age?1849</p>
<p>Why1850, either we must plan to keep the soul absolutely untouched and free from any
stain of evil; or, if our passionate nature makes that quite impossible, then we must plan
that our failures in excellence consist only in mild and easily-curable derelictions. For the
Gospel in its teaching distinguishes between1851 a debtor of ten thousand talents and a
debtor of five hundred pence, and of fifty pence and of a farthing1852, which is “the uttermost”
of coins; it proclaims that God’s just judgment reaches to all, and enhances the payment
necessary as the weight of the debt increases, and on the other hand does not overlook the
very smallest debts. But the Gospel tells us that this payment of debts was not effected by
the refunding of money, but that the indebted man was delivered to the tormentors until
he should pay the whole debt; and that means nothing else than paying in the coin of torment1853
the inevitable recompense, the recompense, I mean, that consists in taking the

share of pain incurred during his lifetime, when he inconsiderately chose mere pleasure,
undiluted with its opposite; so that having put off from him all that foreign growth which
sin is, and discarded the shame of any debts, he might stand in liberty and fearlessness. Now
liberty is the coming up to a state which owns no master and is self-regulating1854; it is that
with which we were gifted by God at the beginning, but which has been obscured by the
feeling of shame arising from indebtedness. Liberty too is in all cases one and the same essentially;
it has a natural attraction to itself. It follows, then, that as everything that is free
will be united with its like, and as virtue is a thing that has no master, that is, is free,
everything that is free will be united with virtue. But, further, the Divine Being is the fountain
of all virtue. Therefore, those who have parted with evil will be united with Him; and so, as
the Apostle says, God will be “all in all1855”; for this utterance seems to me plainly to confirm
<note type="footnote">1854 a state which owns no master and is self-regulating, U+0026c. He repeats this, De Hom. Opif. c. 4: “For the soul
immediately shows its royal and exalted character, far removed from the lowliness of private station, in that it
owns no master, and is self-governed, swayed autocratically by its own will,—for to whom else does this belong
than to a king?” and c. 16: “Thus, there is in us the principle of all excellence, all virtue, and every higher thing
that we conceive: but pre-eminent among all is the fact that we are free from necessity, and not in bondage to
any natural force, but have decision in our power as we please: for virtue is a voluntary thing, subject to no
dominion:” and Orat. Catech. c. 5: “Was it not, then, most right that that which is in every detail made like the
Divine should possess in its nature a self-ruling and independent principle, such as to enable the participation
of the good to be the reward of its virtue?” It would be possible to quote similar language from the Neoplatonists
(e.g. Plotinus vi. 83–6): but Gregory learnt the whole bearing and meaning of moral liberty from none but Origen,
whose so-called “heresies” all flowed from his constant insistence on its reality.</note>
<note type="footnote">1855 This (1 Cor. xv. 28) is a text much handled by the earlier Greek Fathers. Origen especially has made it
one of the Scripture foundations upon which he has built up theology. This passage in Gregory should be compared
with the following in Origen, c. Cels. iv. 69, where he has been speaking of evil and its origin, and its disappearance:
“God checks the wider spread of evil, and banishes it altogether in a way that is conducive to the
good of the whole. Whether or not there is reason to believe that after the banishment of evil it will again appear
is a separate question. By later corrections, then, God does put right some defects: for although in the creation
of the whole all the work was fair and strong, nevertheless a certain healing process is needed for those whom
evil has infected, and for the world itself which it has as it were tainted; and God is never negligent in interfering
on certain occasions in a way suitable to a changeful and alterable world,” U+0026c. “He is like a husbandman performing
different work at different times upon the land, for a final harvest.” Also viii. 72: “This subject requires
much study and demonstration: still a few things must and shall be said at once tending to show that it is not
only possible, but an actual truth, that every being that reasons ‘shall agree in one law’ (quoting Celsus’ words).
Now while the Stoics hold that when the strongest of the elements has by its nature prevailed over the rest, there
shall be the Conflagration, when all things will fall into the fire, we hold that the Word shall some day master
the whole of ‘reasoning nature,’ and shall transfigure it to its own perfection, when each with pure spontaneity
shall will what it wishes, and act what it wills. We hold that there is no analogy to be drawn from the case of</note>

<pb n="843"/>
the opinion we have already arrived at, for it means that God will be instead of all other
things, and in all. For while our present life is active amongst a variety of multiform conditions,
and the things we have relations with are numerous, for instance, time, air, locality,
food and drink, clothing, sunlight, lamplight, and other necessities of life, none of which,
many though they be, are God,—that blessed state which we hope for is in need of none of
these things, but the Divine Being will become all, and instead of all, to us, distributing
Himself proportionately to every need of that existence. It is plain, too, from the Holy
Scripture that God becomes, to those who deserve it, locality, and home, and clothing, and
food, and drink, and light, and riches, and dominion, and everything thinkable and nameable
that goes to make our life happy. But He that becomes “all” things will be “in all” things too;
and herein it appears to me that Scripture teaches the complete annihilation of evil1856. If,
that is, God will be “in all” existing things, evil; plainly, will not then be amongst them; for
if any one was to assume that it did exist then, how will the belief that God will be “in all”
be kept intact? The excepting of that one thing, evil, mars the comprehensiveness of the
term “all.” But He that will be “in all” will never be in that which does not exist.</p>
<p>What then, I asked, are we to say to those whose hearts fail at these calamities1857?</p>
<p>We will say to them, replied the Teacher, this. “It is foolish, good people, for you to fret
and complain of the chain of this fixed sequence of life’s realities; you do not know the goal
towards which each single dispensation of the universe is moving. You do not know that
all things have to be assimilated to the Divine Nature in accordance with the artistic plan
of their author, in a certain regularity and order. Indeed, it was for this that intelligent beings
came into existence; namely, that the riches of the Divine blessings should not lie idle. The
All-creating Wisdom fashioned these souls, these receptacles with free wills, as vessels as it
were, for this very purpose, that there should be some capacities able to receive His blessings
<note type="footnote">bodily diseases, and wounds, where some things are beyond the power of any art of healing. We do not hold
that there are any of the results of sin which the universal Word, and the universal God, cannot heal. The healing
power of the Word is greater than any of the maladies of the soul, and, according to the will, He does draw it to
Himself: and so the aim of things is that evil should be annihilated: whether with no possibility whatever of the
soul ever turning to it again, is foreign to the present discussion. It is sufficient now to quote Zephaniah” (iii.
7–13, LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">1856 But, when A. Jahn, as quoted by Krabinger asserts that Gregory and Origen derived their denial of the
eternity of punishment from a source “merely extraneous,” i.e. the Platonists, we must not forget that Plato
himself in the Phædo, 113 F (cf. also Gorgias, 525 C, and Republic, x. 615), expressly teaches the eternity of
punishment hereafter, for he uses there not the word αἰU+0026 240·ν or αἰωνίος, but οὔποτε. They were influenced
rather by the late Platonists.</note>

and become continually larger with the inpouring of the stream. Such are the wonders1858
that the participation in the Divine blessings works: it makes him into whom they come
larger and more capacious; from his capacity to receive it gets for the receiver an actual increase
in bulk as well, and he never stops enlarging. The fountain of blessings wells up unceasingly,
and the partaker’s nature, finding nothing superfluous and without a use in that
which it receives, makes the whole influx an enlargement of its own proportions, and becomes
at once more wishful to imbibe the nobler nourishment and more capable of containing it;
each grows along with each, both the capacity which is nursed in such abundance of blessings
and so grows greater, and the nurturing supply which comes on in a flood answering to the
growth of those increasing powers. It is likely, therefore, that this bulk will mount to such
a magnitude as1859 there is no limit to check, so that we should not grow into it. With such
a prospect before us, are you angry that our nature is advancing to its goal along the path
appointed for us? Why, our career cannot be run thither-ward, except that which weighs
us down, I mean this encumbering load of earthiness, be shaken off the soul; nor can we be
domiciled in Purity with the corresponding part of our nature, unless we have cleansed
ourselves by a better training from the habit of affection which we have contracted in life
towards this earthiness. But if there be in you any clinging to this body1860, and the being
unlocked from this darling thing give you pain, let not this, either, make you despair. You
will behold this bodily envelopment, which is now dissolved in death, woven again out of
the same atoms, not indeed into this organization with its gross and heavy texture, but with
its threads worked up into something more subtle and ethereal, so that you will not only
<note type="footnote">1858 Such are the wonders. There is here, Denys (De la Philosophie d’Origène, p. 484) remarks, a great difference
between Gregory and Origen. Both speak of an “eternal sabbath,” which will end the circle of our destinies. But
Origen, after all the progress and peregrinations of the soul, which he loves to describe, establishes “the reasoning
nature” at last in an unchangeable quiet and repose; while Gregory sets before the soul an endless career of
perfections and ever increasing happiness. This is owing to their different conceptions of the Deity. Origen
cannot understand how He can know Himself or be accessible to our thought, if He is Infinite: Gregory on the
contrary conceives Him as Infinite, as beyond all real or imaginable boundaries, πασῆς περιγραφῆς ἐκτός (Orat.

entrancing beauty1861.”</p>
<p>But it somehow seems to me now, I said, that the doctrine of the Resurrection necessarily
comes on for our discussion; a doctrine which I think is even at first sight true as well as
credible1862, as it is told us in Scripture; so that that will not come in question between us:
but since the weakness of the human understanding is strengthened still farther by any arguments
that are intelligible to us, it would be well not to leave this part of the subject, either,
without philosophical examination. Let us consider, then, what ought to be said about it.</p>
<p>As for the thinkers, the Teacher went on, outside our own system of thought, they have,
with all their diverse ways of looking at things, one in one point, another in another, approached
and touched the doctrine of the Resurrection: while they none of them exactly
coincide with us, they have in no case wholly abandoned such an expectation. Some indeed
make human nature vile in their comprehensiveness, maintaining that a soul becomes alternately
that of a man and of something irrational; that it transmigrates into various bodies,
changing at pleasure from the man into fowl, fish, or beast, and then returning to human
kind. While some extend this absurdity even to trees1863 and shrubs, so that they consider
their wooden life as corresponding and akin to humanity, others of them hold only thus
much—that the soul exchanges one man for another man, so that the life of humanity is

<note type="footnote">1863 some extend this absurdity even to trees: Empedocles for instance. Cf. Philosophumena (of Hippolytus,
falsely attributed to Origen), p. 50, where two lines of his are quoted. Chrysostom’s words (I. iv. p. 196), “There
are those amongst them who carry souls into plants, into shrubs, and into dogs,” are taken by Matthæus to refer
to Empedocles. Cf. Celsus also (quoted in Origen, c. Cels. viii. 53), “Seeing then men are born bound to a body—no
matter whether the economy of the world required this, or that they are paying the penalty for some sin, or that
the soul is weighted with certain emotions till it is purified from them at the end of its destined cycle, three
myriad hours, according to Empedocles, being the necessary period of its wanderings far away from the Blessed
Ones, during which it passes successively into every perishable shape—we must believe any way that there exist
certain guardians of this prison-house.” See De Hom. Opif. c. 28. Empedocles can be no other, then, than “the
philosopher who asserts that the same thing may be born in anything:” below (p. 232 D). Anaxagoras, however,
seems to have indulged in the same dictum (πᾶν ἐν παντὶ), but with a difference; as Nicetas explains in his
commentary on Gregory Naz., Orations: “That everything is contained in everything Empedocles asserted, and
Anaxagoras asserted also: but not with the same meaning. Empedocles said it of the four elements, namely, that</note>

continued always by means of the same souls, which, being exactly the same in number, are
being born perpetually first in one generation, then in another. As for ourselves, we take
our stand upon the tenets of the Church, and assert that it will be well to accept only so
much of these speculations as is sufficient to show that those who indulge in them are to a
certain extent in accord with the doctrine of the Resurrection. Their statement, for instance,
that the soul after its release from this body insinuates itself into certain other bodies is not
absolutely out of harmony with the revival which we hope for. For our view, which maintains
that the body, both now, and again in the future, is composed of the atoms of the universe,
is held equally by these heathens. In fact, you cannot imagine any constitution of the body
independent of a concourse1864 of these atoms. But the divergence lies in this: we assert that
the same body again as before, composed of the same atoms, is compacted around the soul;
they suppose that the soul alights on other bodies, not only rational, but irrational and even
insensate; and while all are agreed that these bodies which the soul resumes derive their
substance from the atoms of the universe, they part company from us in thinking that they
are not made out of identically the same atoms as those which in this mortal life grew around
the soul. Let then, this external testimony stand for the fact that it is not contrary to probability
that the soul should again inhabit a body; after that however, it is incumbent upon us
to make a survey of the inconsistencies of their position, and it will be easy thus, by means
of the consequences that arise as we follow out the consistent view, to bring the truth to
light. What, then, is to be said about these theories? This that those who would have it that
the soul migrates into natures divergent from each other seem to me to obliterate all natural
distinctions; to blend and confuse together, in every possible respect, the rational, the irrational,
the sentient, and the insensate; if, that is, all these are to pass into each other, with
no distinct natural order1865 secluding them from mutual transition. To say that one and
the same soul, on account of a particular environment of body, is at one time a rational and
intellectual soul, and that then it is caverned along with the reptiles, or herds with the birds,
or is a beast of burden, or a carnivorous one, or swims in the deep; or even drops down to
an insensate thing, so as to strike out roots or become a complete tree, producing buds on
branches, and from those buds a flower, or a thorn, or a fruit edible or noxious—to say this,
is nothing short of making all things the same and believing that one single nature runs

through all beings; that there is a connexion between them which blends and confuses
hopelessly all the marks by which one could be distinguished from another. The philosopher
who asserts that the same thing may be born in anything intends no less than that all things
are to be one; when the observed differences in things are for him no obstacle to mixing
together things which are utterly incongruous. He makes it necessary that, even when one
sees one of the creatures that are venom-darting or carnivorous, one should regard it, in
spite of appearances, as of the same tribe, nay even of the same family, as oneself. With such
beliefs a man will look even upon hemlock as not alien to his own nature, detecting, as he
does, humanity in the plant. The grape-bunch itself1866, produced though it be by cultivation
for the purpose of sustaining life, he will not regard without suspicion; for it too comes from
a plant1867: and we find even the fruit of the ears of corn upon which we live are plants;
how, then, can one put in the sickle to cut them down; and how can one squeeze the bunch,
or pull up the thistle from the field, or gather flowers, or hunt birds, or set fire to the logs
of the funeral pyre: it being all the while uncertain whether we are not laying violent hands
on kinsmen, or ancestors, or fellow-country-men, and whether it is not through the medium
of some body of theirs that the fire is being kindled, and the cup mixed, and the food prepared?
To think that in the case of any single one of these things a soul of a man has become
a plant or animal1868, while no marks are stamped upon them to indicate what sort of plant
or animal it is that has been a man, and what sort has sprung from other beginnings,—such
a conception as this will dispose him who has entertained it to feel an equal amount of interest
in everything: he must perforce either harden himself against actual human beings who are
in the land of the living, or, if his nature inclines him to love his kindred, he will feel alike
towards every kind of life, whether he meet it in reptiles or in wild beasts. Why, if the holder
of such an opinion go into a thicket of trees, even then he will regard the trees as a crowd
of men. What sort of life will his be, when he has to be tender towards everything on the
ground of kinship, or else hardened towards mankind on account of his seeing no difference
between them and the other creatures? From what has been already said, then, we must reject
this theory: and there are many other considerations as well which on the grounds of mere

meaning is strengthened by Krabinger’s reading οὗτος, from five of his Codd. But still if αὐτὸς be retained, it
might have been taken to refer to the man who must needs look suspiciously at a bunch of grapes; “for what,

consistency lead us away from it. For I have heard persons who hold these opinions1869
saying that whole nations of souls are hidden away somewhere in a realm of their own, living
a life analogous to that of the embodied soul; but such is the fineness and buoyancy of their
substance that they themselves’ roll round along with the revolution of the universe; and
that these souls, having individually lost their wings through some gravitation towards evil,
become embodied; first this takes place in men; and after that, passing from a human life,
owing to brutish affinities of their passions, they are reduced1870 to the level of brutes; and,
leaving that, drop down to this insensate life of pure nature1871 which you have been hearing
so much of; so that that inherently fine and buoyant thing that the soul is first becomes
weighted and downward tending in consequence of some vice, and so migrates to a human
body; then its reasoning powers are extinguished, and it goes on living in some brute; and
then even this gift of sensation is withdrawn, and it changes into the insensate plant life;
but after that mounts up again by the same gradations until it is restored to its place in
heaven. Now this doctrine will at once be found, even after a very cursory survey, to have
no coherency with itself. For, first, seeing that the soul is to be dragged down from its life
in heaven, on account of evil there, to the condition of a tree, and is then from this point,
on account of virtue exhibited there, to return to heaven, their theory will be unable to decide
which is to have the preference, the life in heaven, or the life in the tree. A circle, in fact, of
the same sequences will be perpetually traversed, where the soul, at whatever point it may
be, has no resting-place. If it thus lapses from the disembodied state to the embodied, and
thence to the insensate, and then springs back to the disembodied, an inextricable confusion
of good and evil must result in the minds of those who thus teach. For the life in heaven
will no more preserve its blessedness (since evil can touch heaven’s denizens), than the life
in trees will be devoid of virtue (since it is from this, they say, that the rebound of the soul
towards the good begins, while from there it begins the evil life again). Secondly1872, seeing

that the soul as it moves round in heaven is there entangled with evil and is in consequence
dragged down to live in mere matter, from whence, however, it is lifted again into its residence
on high, it follows that those philosophers establish the very contrary1873 of their own views;
they establish, namely, that the life in matter is the purgation of evil, while that undeviating
revolution along with the stars1874 is the foundation and cause of evil in every soul: if it is
here that the soul by means of virtue grows its wing and then soars upwards, and there that
those wings by reason of evil fall off, so that it descends and clings to this lower world and
is commingled with the grossness of material nature. But the untenableness of this view
does not stop even in this, namely, that it contains assertions diametrically opposed to each
other. Beyond this, their fundamental conception1875 itself cannot stand secure on every
side. They say, for instance, that a heavenly nature is unchangeable. How then, can there be
room for any weakness in the unchangeable? If, again, a lower nature is subject to infirmity,
how in the midst of this infirmity can freedom from it be achieved? They attempt to amalgamate
two things that can never be joined together: they descry strength in weakness,
passionlessness in passion. But even to this last view they are not faithful throughout; for
they bring home the soul from its material life to that very place whence they had exiled it
because of evil there, as though the life in that place was quite safe and uncontaminated;
apparently quite forgetting the fact that the soul was weighted with evil there, before it
plunged down into this lower world. The blame thrown on the life here below, and the praise
of the things in heaven, are thus interchanged and reversed; for that which was once blamed
conducts in their opinion to the brighter life, while that which was taken for the better state
gives an impulse to the soul’s propensity to evil. Expel, therefore, from amongst the doctrines
of the Faith all erroneous and shifting suppositions about such matters! We must not follow,
either, as though they had bit the truth those who suppose that souls pass from women’s

(Rufinus’ translation), “Sed et ipsum supereminentem, quem dicunt ἀπλανῆ, globum proprie nihilominus
mundum appellari volunt:” Cicero, De Repub. vi. 17: “Novem tibi orbibus ver potius globis connexa sunt omnia:
quorum unus est coelestis, extimus, qui reliquos omnes complectitur; in quo infixi sunt illi, qui volvuntur, stellarum
cursus sempiterni,” i.e. they roll, not on their axes, but only as turning round with the general revolution.
They are literally fixed in that heaven (cf. Virg.: “tacito volvuntur sidera lapsu”): and the spiritual beings in it
are as fixed and changeless: in fact, with Plato it is the abode only of Divine intelligences, not of the δαίμονες:

bodies to live in men1876, or, reversely1877, that souls that have parted with men’s bodies
exist in women: or even if they only say that they pass from men into men, or from women
into women. As for the former theory1878, not only has it been rejected for being shifting
and illusory, and for landing us in opinions diametrically opposed to each other; but it must
be rejected also because it is a godless theory, maintaining as it does that nothing amongst
the things in nature is brought into existence without deriving its peculiar constitution from
evil as its source. If, that is, neither men nor plants nor cattle can be born unless some soul
from above has fallen into them, and if this fall is owing to some tendency to evil, then they
evidently think that evil controls the creation of all beings. In some mysterious way, too,
both events are to occur at once; the birth of the man in consequence of a marriage, and the
fall of the soul (synchronizing as it must with the proceedings at that marriage). A greater
absurdity even than this is involved: if, as is the fact, the large majority of the brute creation
copulate in the spring, are we, then, to say that the spring brings it about that evil is engendered
in the revolving world above, so that, at one and the same moment, there certain
souls are impregnated with evil and so fall, and here certain brutes conceive? And what are
we to say about the husbandman who sets the vine-shoots in the soil? How does his hand
manage to have covered in a human soul along with the plant, and how does the moulting
of wings last simultaneously with his employment in planting? The same absurdity, it is to
be observed, exists in the other of the two theories as well; in the direction, I mean, of
thinking that the soul must be anxious about the intercourses of those living in wedlock,
and must be on the look-out for the times of bringing forth, in order that it may insinuate
itself into the bodies then produced. Supposing the man refuses the union, or the woman
keeps herself clear of the necessity of becoming a mother, will evil then fail to weigh down
that particular soul? Will it be marriage, in consequence, that sounds up above the first note
of evil in the soul, or will this reversed state invade the soul quite independently of any

theories as well.” Obviously these two theories are those alluded to at the beginning of this last speech of Macrina,
where, speaking of the heathen transmigration, she says, “While some of them extend this absurdity even to
trees and shrubs, so that they consider their wooden life as corresponding and akin to humanity (i.e. ὁ προτέρος
λόγος), others of them opine only thus much, that the soul exchanges one man for another man,” U+0026c. (i.e. ὁ
ἕτερος). In either case the soul is supposed to return from the dead body to heaven, and then by a fresh fall into
sin there, to sink down again. The absurdity and the godlessness is just as glaring, Macrina says, in the last case
(the Platonic soul-rotation) as in the first (Transmigration pure and simple). But the one point in both in contact
with the Christian Resurrection is this, that the soul of the departed does assume another body.</note>

marriage? But then, in this last case, the soul will have to wander about in the interval like
a houseless vagabond, lapsed as it has from its heavenly surroundings, and yet, as it may
happen in some cases, still without a body to receive it. But how, after that, can they imagine
that the Deity exercises any superintendence over the world, referring as they do the beginnings
of human lives to this casual and meaningless descent of a soul. For all that follows
must necessarily accord with the beginning; and so, if a life begins in consequence of a
chance accident, the whole course of it1879 becomes at once a chapter of accidents, and the
attempt to make the whole world depend on a Divine power is absurd, when it is made by
these men, who deny to the individualities in it a birth from the fiat of the Divine Will and
refer the several origins of beings to encounters that come of evil, as though there could
never have existed such a thing as a human life, unless a vice had struck, as it were, its
leading note. If the beginning is like that, a sequel will most certainly be set in motion in
accordance with that beginning. None would dare to maintain that what is fair can come
out of what is foul, any more than from good can come its opposite. We expect fruit in accordance
with the nature of the seed. Therefore this blind movement of chance is to rule
the whole of life, and no Providence is any more to pervade the world.</p>
<p>Nay, even the forecasting by our calculations will be quite useless; virtue will lose its
value; and to turn from evil will not be worth the while. Everything will be entirely under
the control of the driver, Chance; and our lives will differ not at all from vessels devoid of
ballast, and will drift on waves of unaccountable circumstances, now to this, now to that
incident of good or of evil. The treasures of virtue will never be found in those who owe
their constitution to causes quite contrary to virtue. If God really superintends our life, then,
confessedly, evil cannot begin it. But if we do owe our birth to evil, then we must go on living
in complete uniformity with it. Thereby it will be shown that it is folly to talk about the
“houses of correction” which await us after this life is ended, and the “just recompenses,”
and all the other things there asserted, and believed in too, that tend to the suppression of
vice: for how can a man, owing, as he does, his birth to evil, be outside its pale? How can
he, whose very nature has its rise in a vice, as they assert, possess any deliberate impulse
towards a life of virtue? Take any single one of the brute creation; it does not attempt to
speak like a human being, but in using the natural kind of utterance sucked in, as it were,
with its mother’s milk1880, it deems it no loss to be deprived of articulate speech. Just in the
same way those who believe that a vice was the origin and the cause of their being alive will
never bring themselves to have a longing after virtue, because it will be a thing quite foreign
to their nature. But, as a fact1881, they who by reflecting have cleansed the vision of their

soul do all of them desire and strive after a life of virtue. Therefore it is by that fact clearly
proved that vice is not prior in time to the act of beginning to live, and that our nature did
not thence derive its source, but that the all-disposing wisdom of God was the Cause of it:
in short, that the soul issues on the stage of life in the manner which is pleasing to its Creator,
and then (but not before), by virtue of its power of willing, is free to choose that which is to
its mind, and so, whatever it may wish to be, becomes that very thing. We may understand
this truth by the example of the eyes. To see is their natural state; but to fail to see results to
them either from choice or from disease. This unnatural state may supervene instead of the
natural, either by wilful shutting of the eyes or by deprivation of their sight through disease.
With the like truth we may assert that the soul derives its constitution from God, and that,
as we cannot conceive of any vice in Him, it is removed from any necessity of being vicious;
that nevertheless, though this is the condition in which it came into being, it can be attracted
of its own free will in a chosen direction, either wilfully shutting its eyes to the Good, or
letting them be damaged1882 by that insidious foe whom we have taken home to live with
us, and so passing through life in the darkness of error; or, reversely, preserving undimmed
its sight of the Truth and keeping far away from all weaknesses that could darken it.—But
then some one will ask, “When and how did it come into being?” Now as for the question,
how any single thing came into existence, we must banish it altogether from our discussion.
Even in the case of things which are quite within the grasp of our understanding and of
which we have sensible perception, it would be impossible for the speculative reason1883 to
grasp the “how” of the production of the phenomenon; so much so, that even inspired and
saintly men have deemed such questions insoluble. For instance, the Apostle says, “Through
faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which
are seen are not made of things which do appear1884.” He would not, I take it, have spoken
like that, if he had thought that the question could be settled by any efforts of the reasoning
powers. While the Apostle affirms that it is an object of his faith1885 that it was by the will
of God that the world itself and all which is therein was framed (whatever this “world” be
that involves the idea of the whole visible and invisible creation), he has on the other hand
left out of the investigation the “how” of this framing. Nor do I think that this point can
ever be reached by any inquirers. The question presents, on the face of it, many insuperable
difficulties. How, for instance, can a world of movement come from one that is at rest? how
from the simple and undimensional that which shows dimension and compositeness? Did

it come actually out of the Supreme Being? But the fact that this world presents a difference
in kind to that Being militates against1886 such a supposition. Did it then come from some
other quarter? Yet Faith1887 can contemplate nothing as quite outside the Divine Nature;
for we should have to believe in two distinct and separate Principles, if outside the Creative
Cause we are to suppose something else, which the Artificer, with all His skill, has to put
under contribution for the formative processes of the Universe. Since, then, the Cause of
all things is one, and one only, and yet the existences produced by that Cause are not of the
same nature as its transcendent quality, an inconceivability of equal magnitude1888 arises
in both our suppositions, i.e. both that the creation comes straight out of the Divine Being,
and that the universe owes its existence to some cause other than Him; for if created things
are to be of the same nature as God, we must consider Him to be invested with the properties
belonging to His creation; or else a world of matter, outside the circle of God’s substance,
and equal, on the score of the absence in it of all beginning, to the eternity of the Self-existent
One, will have to be ranged against Him: and this is in fact what the followers of Manes,
and some of the Greek philosophers who held opinions of equal boldness with his, did
imagine; and they raised this imagination into a system. In order, then, to avoid falling into
either of these absurdities, which the inquiry into the origin of things involves, let us, following
the example of the Apostle, leave the question of the “how” in each created thing, without
meddling with it at all, but merely observing incidentally that the movement of God’s Will
becomes at any moment that He pleases a fact, and the intention becomes at once realized
in Nature1889; for Omnipotence does not leave the plans of its far-seeing skill in the state
of unsubstantial wishes: and the actualizing of a wish is Substance. In short, the whole world
of existing things falls into two divisions: i.e. that of the intelligible, and that of the corporeal:
and the intelligible creation does not, to begin with, seem to be in any way at variance with
a spiritual Being, but on the contrary to verge closely upon Him, exhibiting as it does that
absence of tangible form and of dimension which we rightly attribute to His transcendent
nature. The corporeal creation1890, on the other hand, must certainly be classed amongst

specialities that have nothing in common with the Deity; and it does offer this supreme
difficulty to the Reason; namely, that the Reason cannot see how the visible comes out of
the invisible, how the hard solid comes out of the intangible, how the finite comes out of the
infinite, how that which is circumscribed by certain proportions, where the idea of quantity
comes in, can come from that which has no size, no proportions, and so on through each
single circumstance of body. But even about this we can say so much: i.e. that not one of
those things which we attribute to body is itself body; neither figure, nor colour, nor weight,
nor extension, nor quantity, nor any other qualifying notion whatever; but every one of
them is a category; it is the combination of them all into a single whole that constitutes body.
Seeing, then, that these several qualifications which complete the particular body are grasped
by thought alone, and not by sense, and that the Deity is a thinking being, what trouble can
it be to such a thinking agent to produce the thinkables whose mutual combination generates
for us the substance of that body? All this discussion, however, lies outside our present
business. The previous question was,—If some souls exist anterior to their bodies, when and
how do they come into existence? and of this question1891, again, the part about the how,
has been left out of our examination and has not been meddled with, as presenting impenetrable
difficulties. There remains the question of the when of the soul’s commencement of
existence: it follows immediately on that which we have already discussed. For if we were
to grant that the soul has lived previous to its body1892 in some place of resort peculiar to
itself, then we cannot avoid seeing some force in all that fantastic teaching lately discussed,
which would explain the soul’s habitation of the body as a consequence of some vice. Again,
on the other hand, no one who can reflect will imagine an after-birth of the soul, i.e. that it
is younger than the moulding of the body; for every one can see for himself that not one

<note type="footnote">1892 Origen, Gregory’s master in most of his theology, did teach this very thing, the pre-existence of the soul:
nor did he attempt to deny that some degree of transmigration was a necessary accompaniment of such teaching;
only he would adjust the moral meaning of it. Cf. c. Celsum, Lib. iii. 75. “And even if we should treat (i e. medically)
those who have caught the folly of the transmigration of souls from doctors who push down a reasoning
nature into any of the unreasoning natures, or even into that which is insensate, how can any say that we shall
not work improvement in their souls by teaching them that the bad do not have allotted to them by way of
punishment that insensate or unreasoning state, but that what is inflicted by God upon the bad, be it pain or
affliction, is only in the way of a very efficacious cure for them? This is the teaching of the wise Christian: he
attempts to teach the simpler of his flock as fathers do the merest infants.” Not the theory itself, but the exaggeration
of it, is here combated.</note>

<pb n="855"/>
amongst all the things that are inanimate or soulless possesses any power of motion or of
growth; whereas there is no question about that which is bred in the uterus both growing
and moving from place to place. It remains therefore that we must think that the point of
commencement of existence is one and the same for body and soul. Also we affirm that,
just as the earth receives the sapling from the hands of the husbandman and makes a tree
of it, without itself imparting the power of growth to its nursling, but only lending it, when
placed within itself, the impulse to grow, in this very same way that which is secreted from
a man for the planting of a man is itself to a certain extent a living being as much gifted with
a soul and as capable of nourishing itself as that from which it comes1893. If this offshoot,
in its diminutiveness, cannot contain at first all the activities and the movements of the soul,
we need not be surprised; for neither in the seed of corn is there visible all at once the ear.
How indeed could anything so large be crowded into so small a space? But the earth keeps
on feeding it with its congenial aliment, and so the grain becomes the ear, without changing
its nature while in the clod, but only developing it and bringing it to perfection under the
stimulus of that nourishment. As, then, in the case of those growing seeds the advance to
perfection is a graduated one1894, so in man’s formation the forces of his soul show themselves
in proportion to the size to which his body has attained. They dawn first in the foetus,
in the shape of the power of nutrition and of development: after that, they introduce into
the organism that has come into the light the gift of perception: then, when this is reached,
they manifest a certain measure of the reasoning faculty, like the fruit of some matured
plant, not growing all of it at once, but in a continuous progress along with the shooting up
of that plant. Seeing, then, that that which is secreted from one living being to lay the
foundations of another living being cannot itself be dead (for a state of deadness arises from
the privation of life, and it cannot be that privation should precede the having), we grasp
from these considerations the fact that in the compound which results from the joining of
both (soul and body) there is a simultaneous passage of both into existence; the one does
not come first, any more than the other comes after. But as to the number of souls, our
reason must necessarily contemplate a stopping some day of its increase; so that Nature’s
stream may not flow on for ever, pouring forward in her successive births and never staying
that onward movement. The reason for our race having some day to come to a standstill is
as follows, in our opinion: since every intellectual reality is fixed in a plenitude of its own,
it is reasonable to expect that humanity1895 also will arrive at a goal (for in this respect also
humanity is not to be parted from the intellectual world1896); so that we are to believe that

it will not be visible for ever only in defect, as it is now: for this continual addition of after
generations indicates that there is something deficient in our race.</p>
<p>Whenever, then, humanity shall have reached the plenitude that belongs to it, this onstreaming
movement of production will altogether cease; it will have touched its destined
bourn, and a new order of things quite distinct from the present precession of births and
deaths will carry on the life of humanity. If there is no birth, it follows necessarily that there
will be nothing to die. Composition must precede dissolution (and by composition I mean
the coming into this world by being born); necessarily, therefore, if this synthesis does not
precede, no dissolution will follow. Therefore, if we are to go upon probabilities, the life
after this is shown to us beforehand as something that is fixed and imperishable, with no
birth and no decay to change it.</p>

the whole discussion seemed now to have arrived at a fitting conclusion. Nevertheless,
fearing that if the Teacher’s illness took a fatal turn (such as did actually happen), we should
have no one amongst us to answer the objections of the unbelievers to the Resurrection1897,
I still insisted.</p>
<p>The argument has not yet touched the most vital of all the questions relating to our
Faith. I mean, that the inspired Writings, both in the New and in the Old Testament, declare
most emphatically not only that, when our race has completed the ordered chain of its existence
as the ages lapse through their complete circle1898, this current streaming onward
as generation succeeds generation will cease altogether, but also that then, when the completed
Universe no longer admits of further increase, all the souls in their entire number
will come back out of their invisible and scattered condition into tangibility and light, the
identical atoms (belonging to each soul) reassembling together in the same order as before;
and this reconstitution of human life is called, in these Writings which contain God’s
teaching, the Resurrection, the entire movement of the atoms receiving the same term as
the raising up of that which is actually prostrate on the ground1899.</p>
<note type="footnote">other, will have completed the πλήρωμα (Humanity) which the Deity contemplates. This immediate apparition
of a soul, as a “thought” of God, is very unlike the teaching of his master Origen: and yet more sober, and more

<p>Why, the actual doctrine of the Resurrection, I replied.</p>
<p>And yet, she answered, much in our long and detailed discussion pointed to that.</p>
<p>Then are you not aware, I insisted, of all the objections, a very swarm of them, which
our antagonists bring against us in connection with that hope of yours?</p>
<p>And I at once tried to repeat all the devices hit upon by their captious champions to
upset the doctrine of the Resurrection.</p>
<p>She, however, replied, First, I think, we must briefly run over the scattered proclamations
of this doctrine in Holy Scripture; they shall give the finishing touch to our discourse. Observe,
then, that I can hear David, in the midst of his praises in the Divine Songs, saying at
the end of the hymnody of the hundred and third (104th) Psalm, where he has taken for his
theme God’s administration of the world, “Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall
die, and return to their dust: Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and
Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.” He says that a power of the Spirit which works in
all vivifies the beings into whom it enters, and deprives those whom He abandons of their
life. Seeing, then, that the dying is declared to occur at the Spirit’s departure, and the renewal
of these dead ones at His appearance, and seeing moreover that in the order of the statement
the death of those who are to be thus renewed comes first, we hold that in these words that
mystery of the Resurrection is proclaimed to the Church, and that David in the spirit of
prophecy expressed this very gift which you are asking about. You will find this same
prophet in another place1900 also saying that “the God of the world, the Lord of everything
that is, hath showed Himself to us, that we may keep the Feast amongst the decorators;” by
that mention of “decoration” with boughs, he means the Feast of Tabernacle-fixing, which,
<note type="footnote">ἀνάστασις is derived from its special use of raising from the ground one who lies prostrate (as a suppliant). Some
of the elements of the body are supposed to be γεώδη, i.e. mingled with their kindred earth. But though strictly
the word ἀνάστασις should apply to them alone, it does not do so, but denotes more generally the movement
of all the atoms to reform the body.</note>

Gr. §532.] The LXX. is rendered by the Psalterium Romanum “constitute diem in confrequentationibus.” So also
Eusebius, Theodoret, and Chrysostom interpret. But the Psalterium Gallicanum reproduces the LXX. otherwise,
i.e. in condensis, as Apollinaris and Jerome (in frondosis) also understand it. “Adorn the feast with green boughs,
even to the horns of the altar”: Luther. “It is true that during the time of the second temple the altar of burnt
offering was planted round about at the Feast of Tabernacles with large branches of osiers, which leaned over
the edge of that altar”: Delitzsch (who however says that this is, linguistically, untenable). Gregory’s rendering
differs from this only in making πυκάζουσιν masculine.</note>

in accordance with Moses’ injunction, has been observed from of old. That lawgiver, I take
it, adopting a prophet’s spirit, predicted therein things still to come; for though the decoration
was always going on it was never finished. The truth indeed was foreshadowed under the
type and riddle of those Feasts that were always occurring, but the true Tabernacle-fixing
was not yet come; and on this account “the God and Lord of the whole world,” according
to the Prophet’s declaration, “hath showed Himself to us, that the Tabernacle-fixing of this
our tenement that has been dissolved may be kept for human kind”; a material decoration,
that is, may be begun again by means of the concourse of our scattered atoms. For that word
πυκασμὸς in its peculiar meaning signifies the Temple-circuit and the decoration which
completes it. Now this passage from the Psalms runs as follows: “God and Lord hath showed
Himself to us; keep the Feast amongst the decorators even unto the horns of the altar;” and
this seems to me to proclaim in metaphors the fact that one single feast is to be kept by the
whole rational creation, and that in that assembly of the saints the inferiors are to join the
dance with their superiors. For in the case of the fabric of that Temple which was the Type
it was not allowed to all who were on the outside of its circuit1901 to come within, but
everything that was Gentile and alien was prohibited from entering; and of those, further,
who had entered, all were not equally privileged to advance towards the centre; but only
those who had consecrated themselves by a holier manner of life, and by certain sprinklings;
and, again, not every one amongst these last might set foot within the interior of the Temple;
the priests alone had the right of entering within the Curtain, and that only for the service
of the sanctuary; while even to the priests the darkened shrine of the Temple, where stood
the beautiful Altar with its jutting horns, was forbidden, except to one of them, who held
the highest office of the priesthood, and who once a year, on a stated day, and unattended,
passed within it, carrying an offering more than usually sacred and mystical. Such being the
differences in connection with this Temple which you know of, it was clearly1902 a representation
and an imitation of the condition of the spirit-world, the lesson taught by these
material observances being this, that it is not the whole of the rational creation that can approach
the temple of God, or, in other words, the adoration of the Almighty; but that those
who are led astray by false persuasions are outside the precinct of the Deity; and that from
the number of those who by virtue of this adoration have been preferred to the rest and
admitted within it, some by reason of sprinklings and purifications have still further privileges;
and again amongst these last those who have been consecrated priests have privileges
further still, even to being admitted to the mysteries of the interior. And, that one may bring
into still clearer light the meaning of the allegory, we may understand the Word here as
teaching this, that amongst all the Powers endued with reason some have been fixed like a
<note type="footnote">1901 Reading τοῖς ἔξωθεν περιβολῆς</note>

<pb n="859"/>
Holy Altar in the inmost shrine of the Deity; and that again of these last some jut forward
like horns, for their eminence, and that around them others are arranged first or second,
according to a prescribed sequence of rank; that the race of man, on the contrary, on account
of indwelling evil was excluded from the Divine precinct, but that purified with lustral water
it re-enters it; and, since all the further barriers by which our sin has fenced us off from the
things within the veil are in the end to be taken down, whenever the time comes that the
tabernacle of our nature is as it were to be fixed up again in the Resurrection, and all the
inveterate corruption of sin has vanished from the world, then a universal feast will be kept
around the Deity by those who have decorated themselves in the Resurrection; and one and
the same banquet will be spread for all, with no differences cutting off any rational creature
from an equal participation in it; for those who are now excluded by reason of their sin will
at last be admitted within the Holiest places of God’s blessedness, and will bind themselves
to the horns of the Altar there, that is, to the most excellent of the transcendental Powers.
The Apostle says the same thing more plainly when he indicates the final accord of the whole
Universe with the Good: “That” to Him “every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”: instead of the “horns,” speaking of that which
is angelic and “in heaven,” and by the other terms signifying ourselves, the creatures whom
we think of next to that; one festival of united voices shall occupy us all; that festival shall
be the confession and the recognition of the Being Who truly Is. One might (she proceeded)
select many other passages of Holy Scripture to establish the doctrine of the Resurrection.
For instance, Ezekiel leaps in the spirit of prophecy over all the intervening time, with its
vast duration; he stands, by his powers of foresight, in the actual moment of the Resurrection,
and, as if he had really gazed on what is still to come, brings it in his description before our
eyes. He saw a mighty plain1903, unfolded to an endless distance before him, and vast heaps
of bones upon it flung at random, some this way, some that; and then under an impulse
from God these bones began to move and group themselves with their fellows that they
once owned, and adhere to the familiar sockets, and then clothe themselves with muscle,
flesh, and skin (which was the process called “decorating” in the poetry of the Psalms); a
Spirit in fact was giving life and movement to everything that lay there. But as regards our
Apostle’s description of the wonders of the Resurrection, why should one repeat it, seeing
that it can easily be found and read? how, for instance, “with a shout” and the “sound of
trumpets” (in the language of the Word) all dead and prostrate things shall be “changed1904
<note type="footnote">1903 Ezek. xxxvii. 1–10.</note>
<note type="footnote">1904 Gregory, as often, seems to quote from memory (ὑπαμειφθήσεσθαι, but 1 Cor. xv. 52 ἀλλαγησόμεθα;
and St. Paul says ἡμεῖς δὲ, i.e. “we shall be changed,” in distinction from the dead generally, who “shall be raised
incorruptible”). But the doctrine of a general resurrection, with or without change, is quite in harmony with the
end of this treatise. Cf. p. 468.</note>

<pb n="860"/>
in the twinkling of an eye” into immortal beings. The expressions in the Gospels also I will
pass over; for their meaning is quite clear to every one; and our Lord does not declare in
word alone that the bodies of the dead shall be raised up again; but He shows in action the
Resurrection itself, making a beginning of this work of wonder from things more within
our reach and less capable of being doubted. First, that is, He displays His life-giving power
in the case of the deadly forms of disease, and chases those maladies by one word of command;
then He raises a little girl just dead; then He makes a young man, who is already being
carried out, sit up on his bier, and delivers him to his mother; after that He calls forth from
his tomb the four-days-dead and already decomposed Lazarus, vivifying the prostrate body
with His commanding voice; then after three days He raises from the dead His own human
body, pierced though it was with the nails and spear, and brings the print of those nails and
the spear-wound to witness to the Resurrection. But I think that a detailed mention of these
things is not necessary; for no doubt about them lingers in the minds of those who have
accepted the written accounts of them.</p>
<p>But that, said I, was not the point in question. Most of your hearers will assent to the
fact that there will some day be a Resurrection, and that man will be brought before the incorruptible
tribunal1905; on account both of the Scripture proofs, and also of our previous
examination of the question. But still the question remains1906: Is the state which we are to
expect to be like the present state of the body? Because if so, then, as I was saying1907, men
had better avoid hoping for any Resurrection at all. For if our bodies are to be restored to
life again in the same sort of condition as they are in when they cease to breathe, then all
<note type="footnote">1905 the incorruptible tribunal. The Judgment comes after the Resurrection (cf. 250 A, 254 A, 258 D), and
after the purifying and chastising detailed above. The latter is represented by Gregory as a necessary process of
nature: but not till the Judgment will the moral value of each life be revealed. There is no contradiction, such as
Möller tries to find, between this Dialogue and Gregory’s Oratio Catechetica. There too he is speaking of chastisement
after the Resurrection and before the Judgment. “For not everything that is granted in the resurrection
a return to existence will return to the same kind of life. There is a wide interval between those who have been
purified (i.e. by baptism) and those who still need purification.”…“But as for those whose weaknesses have become
inveterate, and to whom no purgation of their defilement has been applied, no mystic water, no invocation of
the Divine power, no amendment by repentance, it is absolutely necessary that they should be submitted to
something proper to their case,” i.e. to compensate for Baptism, which they have never received (c. 35).</note>

that man can look forward to in the Resurrection is an unending calamity. For what spectacle
is more piteous than when in extreme old age our bodies shrivel up1908 and change into
something repulsive and hideous, with the flesh all wasted in the length of years, the skin
dried up about the bones till it is all in wrinkles, the muscles in a spasmodic state from being
no longer enriched with their natural moisture, and the whole body consequently shrunk,
the hands on either side powerless to perform their natural work, shaken with an involuntary
trembling? What a sight again are the bodies of persons in a long consumption! They differ
from bare bones only in giving the appearance of being covered with a worn-out veil of skin.
What a sight too are those of persons swollen with the disease of dropsy! What words could
describe the unsightly disfigurement of sufferers from leprosy1909? Gradually over all their
limbs and organs of sensation rottenness spreads and devours them. What words could
describe that of persons who have been mutilated in earthquake, battle, or by any other
visitation, and live on in such a plight for a long time before their natural deaths? Or of
those who from an injury have grown up from infancy with their limbs awry! What can one
say of them? What is one to think about the bodies of newborn infants who have been either
exposed, or strangled, or died a natural death, if they are to be brought to life again just such
as they were? Are they to continue in that infantine state? What condition could be more
miserable than that? Or are they to come to the flower of their age? Well, but what sort of
milk has Nature got to suckle them again with? It comes then to this: that, if our bodies are
to live again in every respect the same as before, this thing that we are expecting is simply
a calamity; whereas if they are not the same, the person raised up will be another than he
who died. If, for instance, a little boy was buried, but a grown man rises again, or reversely,
how can we say that the dead in his very self is raised up, when he has had some one substituted
for him by virtue of this difference in age? Instead of the child, one sees a grown-up
man. Instead of the old man, one sees a person in his prime. In fact, instead of the one person
another entirely. The cripple is changed into the able-bodied man; the consumptive sufferer
into a man whose flesh is firm; and so on of all possible cases, not to enumerate them for
fear of being prolix. If, then, the body will not come to life again just such in its attributes
as it was when it mingled with the earth, that dead body will not rise again; but on the contrary
the earth will be formed into another man. How, then, will the Resurrection affect
myself, when instead of me some one else will come to life? Some one else, I say; for how
could I recognize myself when, instead of what was once myself, I see some one not myself?
It cannot really be I, unless it is in every respect the same as myself. Suppose, for instance,
in this life I had in my memory the traits of some one; say he was bald, had prominent lips,
a somewhat flat nose, a fair complexion, grey eyes, white hair, wrinkled skin; and then went

<pb n="862"/>
to look for such an one, and met a young man with a fine head of hair, an aquiline nose, a
dark complexion, and in all other respects quite different in his type of countenance; am I
likely in seeing the latter to think of the former? But why dwell longer on these the less forcible
objections to the Resurrection, and neglect the strongest one of all? For who has not heard
that human life is like a stream, moving from birth to death at a certain rate of progress,
and then only ceasing from that progressive movement when it ceases also to exist? This
movement indeed is not one of spacial change; our bulk never exceeds itself; but it makes
this advance by means of internal alteration; and as long as this alteration is that which its
name implies, it never remains at the same stage (from moment to moment); for how can
that which is being altered be kept in any sameness? The fire on the wick, as far as appearance
goes, certainly seems always the same, the continuity of its movement giving it the look of
being an uninterrupted and self-centred whole; but in reality it is always passing itself along
and never remains the same; the moisture which is extracted by the heat is burnt up and
changed into smoke the moment it has burst into flame and this alterative force effects the
movement of the flame, working by itself the change of the subject-matter into smoke; just,
then, as it is impossible for one who has touched that flame twice on the same place, to touch
twice the very same flame1910 (for the speed of the alteration is too quick; it does not wait
for that second touch, however rapidly it may be effected; the flame is always fresh and new;
it is always being produced, always transmitting itself, never remaining at one and the same
place), a thing of the same kind is found to be the case with the constitution of our body.
There is influx and afflux going on in it in an alterative progress until the moment that it
ceases to live; as long as it is living it has no stay; for it is either being replenished, or it is
discharging in vapour, or it is being kept in motion by both of these processes combined.
If, then, a particular man is not the same even as he was yesterday1911, but is made different
by this transmutation, when so be that the Resurrection shall restore our body to life again,
<note type="footnote">1910 to touch twice the very same flame. Albert Jahn (quoted by Krabinger) here remarks that Gregory’s
comparison rivals that of Heraclitus: and that there is a deliberate intention of improving on the expression of
the latter, “you cannot step twice into the same stream.” Above (p. 459), Gregory has used directly Heraclitus’
image, “so that Nature’s stream may not flow on for ever, pouring forward in her successive births,” U+0026c. See also
De Hom. Opif. c. 13 (beginning).</note>
<note type="footnote">1911 not the same even as he was yesterday. Cf. Gregory’s Oratio de Mortuis, t. III. p. 633 A. “It is not exaggeration
to say that death is woven into our life. Practically such an idea will be found by any one to be based on a
reality: for experiment would confirm this belief that the man of yesterday is not the same as the man of today
in material substance, but that something of him must be alway becoming dead, or be growing, or being destroyed,
or ejected:…Wherefore, according to the expression of the mighty Paul, ‘we die daily’: we are not always the
same people remaining in the same homes of the body, but each moment we change from what we were by reception
and ejectment, altering continually into a fresh body.”</note>

<pb n="863"/>
that single man will become a crowd of human beings, so that with his rising again there
will be found the babe, the child, the boy, the youth, the man, the father, the old man, and
all the intermediate persons that he once was. But further1912; chastity and profligacy are
both carried on in the flesh; those also who endure the most painful tortures for their religion,
and those on the other hand who shrink from such, both one class and the other reveal their
character in relation to fleshly sensations; how, then, can justice be done at the Judgment1913?</p>
<p>Or take the case of one and the same man first sinning and then cleansing himself by
repentance, and then, it might so happen, relapsing into his sin; in such a case both the defiled
and the undefiled body alike undergoes a change, as his nature changes, and neither of them
continue to the end the same; which body, then, is the profligate to be tortured in? In that
which is stiffened with old age and is near to death? But this is not the same as that which
did the sin. In that, then, which defiled itself by giving way to passion? But where is the old
man, in that case? This last, in fact, will not rise again, and the Resurrection will not do a
complete work; or else he will rise, while the criminal will escape. Let me say something else
also from amongst the objections made by unbelievers to this doctrine. No part, they urge,
of the body is made by nature without a function. Some parts, for instance, are the efficient
causes within us of our being alive; without them our life in the flesh could not possibly be
carried on; such are the heart, liver, brain, lungs, stomach, and the other vitals; others are
assigned to the activities of sensation; others to those of handing and walking1914; others
are adapted for the transmission of a posterity. Now if the life to come is to be in exactly the
same circumstances as this, the supposed change in us is reduced to nothing; but if the report
is true, as indeed it is, which represents marriage as forming no part of the economy of that
after-life, and eating and drinking as not then preserving its continuance, what use will there
be for the members of our body, when we are no longer to expect in that existence any of
the activities for which our members now exist? If, for the sake of marriage, there are now
certain organs adapted for marriage, then, whenever the latter ceases to be, we shall not
<note type="footnote">1912 A fresh objection is here started. It is answered (254 A, B).</note>
<note type="footnote">1913 Which succeeds (and is bound up with) the Resurrection. The argument is, “the flesh has behaved differently
in different persons here; how then can it be treated alike in all by being allowed to rise again? Even before
the judgment an injustice has been done by all rising in the same way to a new life.”—In what follows, ἢ τοῦ

the words below, καὶ πρὸς τὸν δρομον οι πόδες (p. 464). Schmidt well remarks that a simpler form than
μεταβατικός does not exist, because in all walking the notion of putting one foot in the place of the other (μετά)
is implied; and shows that Krabinger’s translation “transeundi officium” makes too much of the word.</note>

need those organs: the same may be said of the hands for working with, the feet for running
with, the mouth for taking food with, the teeth for grinding it with, the organs of the stomach
for digesting, the evacuating ducts for getting rid of that which has become superfluous.
When therefore, all those operations will be no more how or wherefore will their instruments
exist? So that necessarily, if the things that are not going to contribute in any way to that
other life are not to surround the body, none of the parts which at present constitute the
body would1915 exist either. That life1916, then, will be carried on by other instruments; and
no one could call such a state of things a Resurrection, where the particular members are
no longer present in the body, owing to their being useless to that life. But if on the other
hand our Resurrection will be represented in every one of these; then the Author of the
Resurrection will fashion things in us of no use and advantage to that life. And yet we must
believe, not only that there is a Resurrection, but also that it will not be an absurdity. We
must, therefore, listen attentively to the explanation of this, so that, for every part of this
truth we may have its probability saved to the last1917.</p>
<p>When I had finished, the Teacher thus replied, You have attacked the doctrines connected
with the Resurrection with some spirit, in the way of rhetoric as it is called; you have coursed
round and round the truth with plausibly subversive arguments; so much so, that those who
have not very carefully considered this mysterious truth might possibly be affected in their
view of it by the likelihood of those arguments, and might think that the difficulty started
against what has been advanced was not altogether beside the point. But, she proceeded,
the truth does not lie in these arguments, even though we may find it impossible to give a
rhetorical answer to them, couched in equally strong language. The true explanation of all
these questions is still stored up in the hidden treasure-rooms of Wisdom, and will not come
to the light until that moment when we shall be taught the mystery of the Resurrection by
the reality of it; and then there will be no more need of phrases to explain the things which
we now hope for. Just as many questions might be started for debate amongst people sitting
up at night as to the kind of thing that sunshine is, and then the simple appearing of it in

all its beauty would render any verbal description superfluous, so every calculation that tries
to arrive conjecturally at the future state will be reduced to nothingness by the object of our
hopes, when it comes upon us. But since it is our duty not to leave the arguments brought
against us in any way unexamined, we will expound the truth as to these points as follows.
First let us get a clear notion as to the scope of this doctrine; in other words, what is the end
that Holy Scripture has in view in promulgating it and creating the belief in it. Well, to
sketch the outline of so vast a truth and to embrace it in a definition, we will say that the
Resurrection is “the reconstitution of our nature in its original form1918.” But in that form
of life, of which God Himself was the Creator, it is reasonable to believe that there was
neither age nor infancy nor any of the sufferings arising from our present various infirmities,
nor any kind of bodily affliction whatever. It is reasonable, I say, to believe that God was
the Creator of none of these things, but that man was a thing divine before his humanity
got within reach of the assault of evil; that then, however, with the inroad of evil, all these
afflictions also broke in upon him. Accordingly a life that is free from evil is under no necessity
whatever of being passed amidst the things that result from evil. It follows that when a
man travels through ice he must get his body chilled; or when he walks in a very hot sun
that he must get his skin darkened; but if he has kept clear of the one or the other, he escapes
these results entirely, both the darkening and the chilling; no one, in fact, when a particular
cause was removed, would be justified in looking for the effect of that particular cause. Just
so our nature, becoming passional, had to encounter all the necessary results of a life of
passion: but when it shall have started back to that state of passionless blessedness, it will
no longer encounter the inevitable results of evil tendencies. Seeing, then, that all the infusions
of the life of the brute into our nature were not in us before our humanity descended through
the touch of evil into passions, most certainly, when we abandon those passions, we shall
abandon all their visible results. No one, therefore, will be justified in seeking in that other
life for the consequences in us of any passion. Just as if a man, who, clad in a ragged tunic,
has divested himself of the garb, feels no more its disgrace upon him, so we too, when we
have cast off that dead unsightly tunic made from the skins of brutes and put upon us (for
I take the “coats of skins” to mean that conformation belonging to a brute nature with which
we were clothed when we became familiar with passionate indulgence), shall, along with
the casting off of that tunic, fling from us all the belongings that were round us of that skin
of a brute; and such accretions are sexual intercourse, conception, parturition, impurities,
suckling, feeding, evacuation, gradual growth to full size, prime of life, old age, disease, and
death. If that skin is no longer round us, how can its resulting consequences be left behind
<note type="footnote">1918 The actual language of this definition is Platonic (cf. Sympos. p. 193 D), but it is Gregory’s constant
formula for the Christian Resurrection; see De Hom. Opif. c. 17; In Ecclesiast. I. p. 385 A; Funeral Oration for
Pulcheria, III. p. 523 C; Orat. de Mortuis, III. p. 632 C; De Virginitate, c. xii. p. 358.</note>

within us? It is folly, then, when we are to expect a different state of things in the life to
come, to object to the doctrine of the Resurrection on the ground of something that has
nothing to do with it. I mean, what has thinness or corpulence, a state of consumption or
of plethora, or any other condition supervening in a nature that is ever in a flux, to do with
the other life, stranger as it is to any fleeting and transitory passing such as that? One thing,
and one thing only, is required for the operation of the Resurrection; viz. that a man should
have lived, by being born; or, to use rather the Gospel words, that “a man should be born1919
into the world”; the length or briefness of the life, the manner, this or that, of the death, is
an irrelevant subject of inquiry in connection with that operation. Whatever instance we
take, howsoever we suppose this to have been, it is all the same; from these differences in
life there arises no difficulty, any more than any facility, with regard to the Resurrection.
He who has once begun to live must necessarily go on having once lived1920, after his intervening
dissolution in death has been repaired in the Resurrection.</p>
<p>As to the how and the when of his dissolution, what do they matter to the Resurrection?
Consideration of such points belongs to another line of inquiry altogether. For instance, a
man may have lived in bodily comfort, or in affliction, virtuously or viciously, renowned
or disgraced; he may have passed his days miserably, or happily. These and such-like results
must be obtained from the length of his life and the manner of his living; and to be able to
pass a judgment on the things done in his life, it will be necessary for the judge to scrutinize
his indulgences, as the case may be, or his losses, or his disease, or his old age, or his prime,
or his youth, or his wealth, or his poverty: how well or ill a man, placed in either of these,
concluded his destined career; whether he was the recipient of many blessings, or of many
ills in a length of life; or tasted neither of them at all, but ceased to live before his mental
powers were formed. But whenever the time come that God shall have brought our nature
back to the primal state of man, it will be useless to talk of such things then, and to imagine
that objections based upon such things can prove God’s power to be impeded in arriving
at His end. His end is one, and one only; it is this: when the complete whole of our race shall
have been perfected from the first man to the last,—some having at once in this life been
cleansed from evil, others having afterwards in the necessary periods been healed by the
Fire, others having in their life here been unconscious equally of good and of evil,—to offer
to every one of us participation in the blessings which are in Him, which, the Scripture tells
us, “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,” nor thought ever reached. But this is nothing else, as
I at least understand it, but to be in God Himself; for the Good which is above hearing and

eye and heart must be that Good which transcends the universe. But the difference between
the virtuous and the vicious life led at the present time1921 will be illustrated in this way;
viz. in the quicker or more tardy participation of each in that promised blessedness. According
to the amount of the ingrained wickedness of each will be computed the duration of his
cure. This cure consists in the cleansing of his soul, and that cannot be achieved without an
excruciating condition, as has been expounded in our previous discussion. But any one
would more fully comprehend the futility and irrelevancy of all these objections by trying
to fathom the depths of our Apostle’s wisdom. When explaining this mystery to the Corinthians,
who, perhaps, themselves were bringing forward the same objections to it as its
impugners to-day bring forward to overthrow our faith, he proceeds on his own authority
to chide the audacity of their ignorance, and speaks thus: “Thou wilt say, then, to me, How
are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou
sowest is not quickened, except it die; And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that
body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain; But God
giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him.” In that passage, as it seems to me, he gags the mouths
of men who display their ignorance of the fitting proportions in Nature, and who measure
the Divine power by their own strength, and think that only so much is possible to God as
the human understanding can take in, but that what is beyond it surpasses also the Divine
ability. For the man who had asked the Apostle, “how are the dead raised up?” evidently
implies that it is impossible when once the body’s atoms have been scattered that they should
again come in concourse together; and this being impossible, and no other possible form
of body, besides that arising from such a concourse, being left, he, after the fashion of clever
controversialists, concludes the truth of what he wants to prove, by a species of syllogism,
thus: If a body is a concourse of atoms, and a second assemblage of these is impossible, what
sort of body will those get who rise again? This conclusion, involved seemingly in this artful
contrivance of premisses, the Apostle calls “folly,” as coming from men who failed to perceive
in other parts of the creation the masterliness of the Divine power. For, omitting the sublimer
miracles of God’s hand, by which it would have been easy to place his hearer in a dilemma
(for instance he might have asked “how or whence comes a heavenly body, that of the sun
for example, or that of the moon, or that which is seen in the constellations; whence the
firmament, the air, water, the earth?”), he, on the contrary, convicts the objectors of inconsiderateness
by means of objects which grow alongside of us and are very familiar to all.

scendent powers of the Deity limits them by his own is a fool?” Whence do seeds get the
bodies that spring up from them? What precedes this springing up? Is it not a death that
precedes1922? At least, if the dissolution of a compacted whole is a death; for indeed it cannot
be supposed that the seed would spring up into a shoot unless it had been dissolved in the
soil, and so become spongy and porous to such an extent as to mingle its own qualities with
the adjacent moisture of the soil, and thus become transformed into a root and shoot; not
stopping even there, but changing again into the stalk with its intervening knee-joints that
gird it up like so many clasps, to enable it to carry with figure erect the ear with its load of
corn. Where, then, were all these things belonging to the grain before its dissolution in the
soil? And yet this result sprang from that grain; if that grain had not existed first, the ear
would not have arisen. Just, then, as the “body” of the ear comes to light out of the seed,
God’s artistic touch of power producing it all out of that single thing, and just as it is neither
entirely the same thing as that seed nor something altogether different, so (she insisted) by
these miracles performed on seeds you may now interpret the mystery of the Resurrection.
The Divine power, in the superabundance of Omnipotence, does not only restore you that
body once dissolved, but makes great and splendid additions to it, whereby the human being
is furnished in a manner still more magnificent.</p>
<note type="footnote">1922 Dr. H. Schmidt has an admirable note here, pointing out the great and important difference between S.
Paul’s use of this analogy of the grain of wheat, and that of our Saviour in S. John xii. 23, whence S. Paul took
it. In the words, “The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily I say unto you, Except
a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit” (A.V.),
the fact and the similitude exactly correspond. To the corn with its life-engendering shoot, answers the man
with his vivifying soul. The shoot, when the necessary conditions are fulfilled, breaks through the corn, and
mounts up into an ear, exquisitely developed: so the soul, when the due time is come, bursts from the body into
a nobler form. Again, through the death of the integument a number of new corns are produced: so through
the death of the body that encases a perfect soul (i.e. that of Jesus), an abundance of blessings is produced for
mankind. Everything here exactly corresponds; the principle of life, on the one hand in the corn, on the other
hand in the human body, breaks, by dying, into a more beautiful existence. But this comparison in S. Paul becomes
a similitude rather than an analogy. With him the lifeless body is set over against the life-containing corn; he
does not compare the lifeless body with the lifeless corn: because out of the latter no stalk and ear would ever
grow. The comparison, therefore, is not exact: it is not pretended that the rising to life of the dead human body
is not a process transcendently above the natural process of the rising of the ear of wheat. But the similitude
serves to illustrate the form and the quality of the risen body, which has been in question since v. 35 (1 Cor. xv.),
“with what body do they come?” and the salient point is that the risen body will be as little like the buried body,
as the ear of wheat is like its corn. The possibility of the Resurrection has been already proved by S. Paul in this
chapter by Christ’s own Resurrection, which he states from the very commencement as a fact: it is not proved
by this similitude.</note>

<p>“It is sown,” he says, “in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in weakness;
it is raised in power: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown a natural body;
it is raised a spiritual body.” The grain of wheat, after its dissolution in the soil, leaves behind
the slightness of its bulk and the peculiar quality of its shape, and yet it has not left and lost
itself, but, still self-centred, grows into the ear, though in many points it has made an advance
upon itself, viz. in size, in splendour, in complexity, in form. In the same fashion the human
being deposits in death all those peculiar surroundings which it has acquired from passionate
propensities; dishonour, I mean, and corruption and weakness and characteristics of age;
and yet the human being does not lose itself. It changes into an ear of corn as it were; into
incorruption, that is, and glory and honour and power and absolute perfection; into a condition
in which its life is no longer carried on in the ways peculiar to mere nature, but has
passed into a spiritual and passionless existence. For it is the peculiarity of the natural body
to be always moving on a stream, to be always altering from its state for the moment and
changing into something else; but none of these processes, which we observe not in man
only but also in plants and brutes will be found remaining in the life that shall be then.
Further, it seems to me that the words of the Apostle in every respect harmonize with our
own conception of what the Resurrection is. They indicate the very same thing that we have
embodied in our own definition of it, wherein we said that the Resurrection is no other
thing than “the re-constitution of our nature in its original form.” For, whereas we learn from
Scripture in the account of the first Creation1923, that first the earth brought forth “the green
herb” (as the narrative says), and that then from this plant seed was yielded, from which,
when it was shed on the ground, the same form of the original plant again sprang up, the
Apostle, it is to be observed, declares that this very same thing happens in the Resurrection
also; and so we learn from him the fact, not only1924 that our humanity will be then changed
into something nobler, but also that what we have therein to expect is nothing else than that
which was at the beginning. In the beginning, we see, it was not an ear rising from a grain,
but a grain coming from an ear, and, after that, the ear grows round the grain: and so the
order indicated in this similitude1925 clearly shows that all that blessed state, which arises
for us by means of the Resurrection is only a return to our pristine state of grace. We too,
in fact, were once in a fashion a full ear1926; but the burning heat of sin withered us up, and
then on our dissolution by death the earth received us: but in the spring of the Resurrection

she will reproduce this naked grain1927 of our body in the form of an ear, tall, well-proportioned,
and erect, reaching to the heights of heaven, and, for blade and beard, resplendent
in incorruption, and with all the other godlike marks. For “this corruptible must put on incorruption”;
and this incorruption and glory and honour and power are those distinct and
acknowledged marks of Deity which once belonged to him who was created in God’s image,
and which we hope for hereafter. The first man Adam, that is, was the first ear; but with the
arrival of evil human nature was diminished into a mere multitude1928; and, as happens to
the grain1929 on the ear, each individual man was denuded of the beauty of that primal ear,
and mouldered in the soil: but in the Resurrection we are born again in our original
splendour; only instead of that single primitive ear we become the countless myriads of ears
<note type="footnote">1927 This “naked grain” is suggested by the words of S. Paul, not so much 1 Cor. xv. 37, as 2 Cor. v. 4: “For
we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.”
Tertullian’s words (de resurr. carnis c. 52) deserve to be quoted, “Seritur granum sine folliculi veste, sine fundamento
spicæ, sine munimento aristæ, sine superbiâ culmi. Exsurgit copiâ feneratum, compagine ædificatum,
ordine structum, cultu munitum, et usquequaque vestitum.” In allusion to this passage (2 Cor. v. 4), Origen
says, “Our theory of the Resurrection teaches that the relations of a seed attach to that which the Scriptures call
the ‘tabernacle of the soul,’ in which the righteous ‘do groan being burdened,’ not wishing to put it off, but ‘to
be clothed upon’ (with something else). We do not, as Celsus thinks, mean by the resurrection anything like the
transmigration of souls. The soul, in its essence unbodied and invisible, when it comes into material space, requires
a body fitted to the conditions of that particular space: which body it wears, having either put off a former body,
or else having put it on over its former body…For instance, when it comes to the actual birth into this world it
lays aside the environment (χωρίον) which was needed as long as it is in the womb of her that is with child: and
it clothes itself with that which is necessary for one destined to pass through life. Then there is a ‘tabernacle,’
and ‘an earthly house,’ as well: and the Scriptures tell us that this ‘earthly house’ of the tabernacle is to be dissolved,
but that the tabernacle itself is to surround itself with another house not made with hands. The men of God
declare that the corruptible must put on incorruption (which is a different thing from the incorruptible), and
the mortal must put on immortality (which is different from the immortal: just as the relative quality of wisdom
is different from that which is absolutely wise). Observe, then, where this system leads us. It says that the souls
put on incorruption and immortality like garments which keep their wearer from corruption, and their inmate
(τὸν περικείμενον αὐτὰ) from death” (c. Cels. vii. 32). We see at once this is another explanation of the Resurrection,
by the σπερματικὸς λόγος of the soul, and not Gregory’s; with him the soul recollects its scattered atoms,
and he thus saves the true scriptural view.</note>
<note type="footnote">1928 This connection of “evil” and “multitude” is essentially Platonic. Cf. also Plotinus, vi. 6. 1: “Multitude,

bad, and we are bad, when we are a multitude” (cf. “Legion” in the parable).</note>

in the cornfields. The virtuous life as contrasted with that of vice is distinguished thus: those
who while living have by virtuous conduct exercised husbandry on themselves are at once
revealed in all the qualities of a perfect ear, while those whose bare grain (that is the forces
of their natural soul) has become through evil habits degenerate, as it were, and hardened
by the weather (as the so-called “hornstruck” seeds1930, according to the experts in such
things, grow up), will, though they live again in the Resurrection, experience very great
severity from their Judge, because they do not possess the strength to shoot up into the full
proportions of an ear, and thereby become that which we were before our earthly fall1931.
The remedy offered by the Overseer of the produce is to collect together the tares and the
thorns, which have grown up with the good seed, and into whose bastard life all the secret
forces that once nourished its root have passed, so that it not only has had to remain without
its nutriment, but has been choked and so rendered unproductive by this unnatural growth.
When from the nutritive part within them everything that is the reverse or the counterfeit
of it has been picked out, and has been committed to the fire that consumes everything
unnatural, and so has disappeared, then in this class also their humanity will thrive and will
ripen into fruit-bearing, owing to such husbandry, and some day after long courses of ages
will get back again that universal form which God stamped upon us at the beginning. Blessed
are they, indeed, in whom the full beauty of those ears shall be developed directly they are
born in the Resurrection. Yet we say this without implying that any merely bodily distinctions
will be manifest between those who have lived virtuously and those who have lived viciously
in this life, as if we ought to think that one will be imperfect as regards his material frame,
while another will win perfection as regards it. The prisoner and the free, here in this present
world, are just alike as regards the constitutions of their two bodies; though as regards enjoyment
and suffering the gulf is wide between them. In this way, I take it, should we reckon
the difference between the good and the bad in that intervening time1932. For the perfection

process of sowing: according to the rustic superstition, which Gregory Nazianz. in some very excellent hexameters
alludes to (Opp. t. II. pp. 66–163): “There is,” he says, “a dry unsoakable seed, which never sinks into the ground,
or fattens with the rain; it is harder than horn; its horn has struck the horn of the ox, what time the ploughman’s
hand is scattering the grain over his land.” Ruhnken (ad Timæum, p. 155) has collected the ancient authorities
on this point. The word is used by Plato of a “hard,” “intractable” person. The “bare grain” of the wicked is here
compared to these hard seeds, which even though they may sink into the earth and rise again, yet have a poor
and stunted blade, which may never grow.</note>

of bodies that rise from that sowing of death is, as the Apostle tells us, to consist in incorruption
and glory and honour and power; but any diminution in such excellences does not
denote a corresponding bodily mutilation of him who has risen again, but a withdrawal and
estrangement from each one of those things which are conceived of as belonging to the
good. Seeing, then, that one or the other of these two diametrically opposed ideas, I mean
good and evil, must any way attach to us, it is clear that to say a man is not included in the
good is a necessary demonstration that he is included in the evil. But then, in connection
with evil, we find no honour, no glory, no incorruption, no power; and so we are forced to
dismiss all doubt that a man who has nothing to do with these last-mentioned things must
be connected with their opposites, viz. with weakness, with dishonour, with corruption,
with everything of that nature, such as we spoke of in the previous parts of the discussion,
when we said how many were the passions, sprung from evil, which are so hard for the soul
to get rid of, when they have infused themselves into the very substance of its entire nature
and become one with it. When such, then, have been purged from it and utterly removed
by the healing processes worked out by the Fire, then every one of the things which make
up our conception of the good will come to take their place; incorruption, that is, and life,
and honour, and grace, and glory, and everything else that we conjecture is to be seen in
God, and in His Image, man as he was made.</p>

Prologue and Chapter 1.</head>
<p>The belief in God rests on the art and wisdom displayed in
the order of the world: the belief in the Unity of God, on the perfection that must belong to
Him in respect of power, goodness, wisdom, etc. Still, the Christian who combats polytheism
has need of care lest in contending against Hellenism he should fall unconsciously into
Judaism. For God has a Logos: else He would be without reason. And this Logos cannot be
merely an attribute of God. We are led to a more exalted conception of the Logos by the
consideration that in the measure in which God is greater than we, all His predicates must
also be higher than those which belong to us. Our logos is limited and transient; but the
subsistence of the Divine Logos must be indestructible; and at the same time living, since
the rational cannot be lifeless, like a stone. It must also have an independent life, not a participated
life, else it would lose its simplicity; and, as living, it must also have the faculty of
will. This will of the Logos must be equalled by his power: for a mixture of choice and impotence
would, again, destroy the simplicity. His will, as being Divine, must be also good.
From this ability and will to work there follows the realization of the good; hence the
bringing into existence of the wisely and artfully adjusted world. But since, still further, the
logical conception of the Word is in a certain sense a relative one, it follows that together
with the Word He Who speaks it, i.e. the Father of the Word, must be recognized as existing.
Thus the mystery of the faith avoids equally the absurdity of Jewish monotheism, and that
of heathen polytheism. On the one hand, we say that the Word has life and activity; on the
other, we affirm that we find in the Λόγος, whose existence is derived from the Father, all
the attributes of the Father’s nature.</p>

<p>God created the world by His reason and wisdom; for He cannot
have proceeded irrationally in that work; but His reason and wisdom are, as above shown,
not to be conceived as a spoken word, or as the mere possession of knowledge, but as a
personal and willing potency. If the entire world was created by this second Divine hypostasis,
then certainly was man also thus created; yet not in view of any necessity, but from
superabounding love, that there might exist a being who should participate in the Divine
perfections. If man was to be receptive of these, it was necessary that his nature should
contain an element akin to God; and, in particular, that he should be immortal. Thus, then,
man was created in the image of God. He could not therefore be without the gifts of freedom,
independence, self-determination; and his participation in the Divine gifts was consequently
made dependent on his virtue. Owing to this freedom he could decide in favour of evil,
which cannot have its origin in the Divine will, but only in our inner selves, where it arises
in the form of a deviation from good, and so a privation of it. Vice is opposed to virtue only
as the absence of the better. Since, then, all that is created is subject to change, it was possible
that, in the first instance, one of the created spirits should turn his eye away from the good,
and become envious, and that from this envy should arise a leaning towards badness, which
should, in natural sequence, prepare the way for all other evil. He seduced the first men into
the folly of turning away from goodness, by disturbing the Divinely ordered harmony between
their sensuous and intellectual natures; and guilefully tainting their wills with evil.</p>

Christ took human weakness upon Him; but it was physical, not moral, weakness. In other
words the Divine goodness did not change to its opposite, which is only vice. In Him soul

<p>What, then, is the justice in it? We must remember that
man was necessarily created subject to change (to better or to worse). Moral beauty was to
be the direction in which his free will was to move; but then he was deceived, to his ruin,
by an illusion of that beauty. After we had thus freely sold ourselves to the deceiver, He who
of His goodness sought to restore us to liberty could not, because He was just too, for this
end have recourse to measures of arbitrary violence. It was necessary therefore that a ransom
should be paid, which should exceed in value that which was to be ransomed; and hence it
was necessary that the Son of God should surrender Himself to the power of death. God’s

it.</p>

<p>The saving nature of Baptism depends
on three things; Prayer, Water, and Faith. 1. It is shown how Prayer secures the Divine
Presence. God is a God of truth; and He has promised to come (as Miracles prove that He
has come already) if invoked in a particular way. 2. It is shown how the Deity gives life from
water. In human generation, even without prayer, He gives life from a small beginning. In
a higher generation He transforms matter, not into soul, but into spirit. 3. Human freedom,
as evinced in faith and repentance, is also necessary to Regeneration. Being thrice dipped

whole into each one of the Faithful? This needs an illustration. Water gives its own body to
a skin-bottle. So nourishment (bread and wine) by becoming flesh and blood gives bulk to
the human frame: the nourishment is the body. Just as in the case of other men, our Saviour’s
nourishment (bread and wine) was His Body; but these, nourishment and Body, were in
Him changed into the Body of God by the Word indwelling. So now repeatedly the bread

<head>Prologue.</head>
<p>The presiding ministers of the “mystery of godliness”1934 have need of a system in their
instructions, in order that the Church may be replenished by the accession of such as should
be saved1935, through the teaching of the word of Faith being brought home to the hearing
of unbelievers. Not that the same method of instruction will be suitable in the case of all
who approach the word. The catechism must be adapted to the diversities of their religious
worship; with an eye, indeed, to the one aim and end of the system, but not using the same
method of preparation in each individual case. The Judaizer has been preoccupied with one
set of notions, one conversant with Hellenism, with others; while the Anomoean, and the
Manichee, with the followers of Marcion1936, Valentinus, and Basilides1937, and the rest on
the list of those who have wandered into heresy, each of them being prepossessed with their
peculiar notions, necessitate a special controversy with their several. opinions. The method
of recovery must be adapted to the form of the disease. You will not by the same means cure
the polytheism of the Greek, and the unbelief of the Jew as to the Only-begotten God: nor
as regards those who have wandered into heresy will you, by the same arguments in each
case, upset their misleading romances as to the tenets of the Faith. No one could set Sabelli-

<note type="footnote">1936 Marcion, a disciple of Cerdo, added a third Principle to the two which his master taught. The first is an
unnamed, invisible, and good God, but no creator; the second is a visible and creative God, i.e. the Demiurge;
the third intermediate between the invisible and visible God, i.e. the Devil. The Demiurge is the God and Judge
of the Jews. Marcion affirmed the Resurrection of the soul alone. He rejected the Law and the Prophets as proceeding
from the Demiurge; only Christ came down from the unnamed and invisible Father to save the soul,
and to confute this God of the Jews. The only Gospel he acknowledged was S. Luke’s, omitting the beginning
which details our Lord’s Conception and Incarnation. Other portions also both in the middle and the end he
curtailed. Besides this broken Gospel of S. Luke he retained ten of the Apostolic letters, but garbled even them.
Gregory says elsewhere that the followers of Eunomius got their “duality of Gods” from Marcion, but went
beyond him in denying essential goodness to the Only-begotten, the “God of the Gospel.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1937 Of the Gnostics Valentinus and Basilides the truest and best account is given in H. L. Mansel’s Gnostics,
and in the articles upon them in the Dictionary of Christian Biography. It is there shown how all their visions of
celestial Hierarchies, and the romances connected with them, were born of the attempt to solve the insoluble
problem, i.e. how that which in modern philosophy would be called the Infinite is to pass into the Finite. They
fell into the fatalism of the Emanationist view of the Deity, but still the attempt was an honest one.</note>

us1938 right by the same instruction as would benefit the Anomoean1939. The controversy
with the Manichee is profitless against the Jew1940. It is necessary, therefore, as I have said,
to regard the opinions which the persons have taken up, and to frame your argument in
accordance with the error into which each has fallen, by advancing in each discussion certain
principles and reasonable propositions, that thus, through what is agreed upon on both
sides, the truth may conclusively be brought to light. When, then, a discussion is held with
one of those who favour Greek ideas, it would be well to make the ascertaining of this the
commencement of the reasoning, i.e. whether he presupposes the existence of a God, or
concurs with the atheistic view. Should he say there is no God, then, from the consideration
of the skilful and wise economy of the Universe he will be brought to acknowledge that there
is a certain overmastering power manifested through these channels. If, on the other hand,
he should have no doubt as to the existence of Deity, but should be inclined to entertain the
presumption of a plurality of Gods, then we will adopt against him some such train of
reasoning as this: “does he think Deity is perfect or defective?” and if, as is likely, he bears
testimony to the perfection in the Divine nature, then we will demand of him to grant a
perfection throughout in everything that is observable in that divinity, in order that Deity
may not be regarded as a mixture of opposites, defect and perfection. But whether as respects
power, or the conception of goodness, or wisdom and imperishability and eternal existence,
or any other notion besides suitable to the nature of Deity, that is found to lie close to the
subject of our contemplation, in all he will agree that perfection is the idea to be entertained
of the Divine nature, as being a just inference from these premises. If this, then, be granted
<note type="footnote">1938 Sabellius. The Sabellian heresy was rife in the century preceding: i.e. that Personality is attributed to the
Deity only from the exigency of human language, that consequently He is sometimes characterized as the
Father, when operations and works more appropriate to the paternal relation are spoken of; and so in like
manner of the Son, and the Holy Ghost; as when Redemption is the subject, or Sanctification. In making the
Son the Father, it is the opposite pole to Arianism.</note>
<note type="footnote">1939 “We see also the rise (i.e. a.d. 350) of a new and more defiant Arian school, more in earnest than the
older generation, impatient of their shuffling diplomacy, and less pliant to court influences. Aetius.…came to
rest in a clear and simple form of Arianism. Christianity without mystery seems to have been his aim. The
Anomoean leaders took their stand on the doctrine of Arius himself and dwelt with emphasis on its most offensive
aspects. Arius had long ago laid down the absolute unlikeness of the Son to the Father, but for years past the
Arianizers had prudently softened it down. Now, however, ‘unlike’ became the watchword of Aetius and Eunomius”:
Gwatkin’s Arians. For the way in which this school treated the Trinity see Against Eunomius, p. 50.</note>
<note type="footnote">1940 I.e.an argument against Dualism would only confirm the Jew in his stern monotheism. Manes had taught
also that “those souls who believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God renounce the worship of the God of the
Jews, who is the Prince of Darkness,” and that “the Old Testament was the work of this Prince, who was substituted
by the Jews in the place of the true God.”</note>

us, it would not be difficult to bring round these scattered notions of a plurality of Gods to
the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if he admits that perfection is in every respect
to be ascribed to the subject before us, though there is a plurality of these perfect things
which are marked with the same character, he must be required by a logical necessity, either
to point out the particularity in each of these things which present no distinctive variation,
but are found always with the same marks, or, if (he cannot do that, and) the mind can grasp
nothing in them in the way of particular, to give up the idea of any distinction. For if neither
as regards “more and less” a person can detect a difference (in as much as the idea of perfection
does not admit of it), nor as regards “worse” and “better” (for he cannot entertain a
notion of Deity at all where the term “worse” is not got rid of), nor as regards “ancient” and
“modern” (for what exists not for ever is foreign to the notion of Deity), but on the contrary
the idea of Godhead is one and the same, no peculiarity being on any ground of reason to
be discovered in any one point, it is an absolute necessity that the mistaken fancy of a plurality
of Gods would be forced to the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if goodness,
and justice, and wisdom, and power may be equally predicated of it, then also imperishability
and eternal existence, and every orthodox idea would be in the same way admitted. As then
all distinctive difference in any aspect whatever has been gradually removed, it necessarily
follows that together with it a plurality of Gods has been removed from his belief, the general
identity bringing round conviction to the Unity.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">  
<pb n="881"/>
<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>But since our system of religion is wont to observe a distinction of persons in the unity
of the Nature, to prevent our argument in our contention with Greeks sinking to the level
of Judaism there is need again of a distinct technical statement in order to correct all error
on this point.</p>
<p>For not even by those who are external to our doctrine is the Deity held to be without
Logos1941. Now this admission of theirs will quite enable our argument to be unfolded. For
he who admits that God is not without Logos, will agree that a being who is not without
Logos (or word) certainly possesses Logos. Now it is to be observed that the utterance of
man is expressed by the same term. If, then, he should say that he understands what the
Logos of God is according to the analogy of things with us, he will thus be led on to a loftier
idea, it being an absolute necessity for him to believe that the utterance, just as everything
else, corresponds with the nature. Though, that is, there is a certain sort of force, and life,
and wisdom, observed in the human subject, yet no one from the similarity of the terms
would suppose that the life, or power, or wisdom, were in the case of God of such a sort as
that, but the significations of all such terms are lowered to accord with the standard of our
nature. For since our nature is liable to corruption and weak, therefore is our life short, our
strength unsubstantial, our word unstable1942. But in that transcendent nature, through the
greatness of the subject contemplated, every thing that is said about it is elevated with it.
Therefore though mention be made of God’s Word it will not be thought of as having its
realization in the utterance of what is spoken, and as then vanishing away, like our speech,
into the nonexistent. On the contrary, as our nature, liable as it is to come to an end, is endued
with speech which likewise comes to an end, so that, imperishable and ever-existing nature
has eternal, and substantial speech. If, then, logic requires him to admit this eternal subsistence
of God’s Word, it is altogether necessary to admit also that the subsistence1943 of that
<note type="footnote">1941 the Deity…without Logos. In another treatise (De Fide, p. 40) Gregory bases the argument for the
eternity of the Λόγος on John i. 1, where it is not said, “after the beginning,” but “in the beginning.” The beginning,
therefore, never was without the Λόγος.</note>
<note type="footnote">1942 unstable: ἀπαγὴς (the reading ἅρπαγις is manifestly wrong). So afterwards human speech is called
ἐπίκηρος. Cf. Athanasius (Contr. Arian. 3): “Since man came from the non-existent, therefore his ‘word’ also
has a pause, and does not last. From man we get, day after day, many different words, because the first abide
not, but are forgotten.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1943 ὑπόστασιν. About this oft repeated word the question arises whether we are indebted to Christians or
to Platonists for the first skilful use of it in expressing that which is neither substance nor quality. Abraham
Tucker (Light of Nature, ii. p. 191) hazards the following remark with regard to the Platonic Triad, i.e. Goodness,
Intelligence, Activity, viz. that quality would not do as a general name for these principles, because the ideas
and abstract essences existed in the Intelligence, U+0026c., and qualities cannot exist in one another, e.g. yellowness</note>

<pb n="882"/>
word consists in a living state; for it is an impiety to suppose that the Word has a soulless
subsistence after the manner of stones. But if it subsists, being as it is something with intellect
and without body, then certainly it lives, whereas if it be divorced from life, then as certainly
it does not subsist; but this idea that the Word of God does not subsist, has been shown to
be blasphemy. By consequence, therefore, it has also been shown that the Word is to be
considered as in a living condition. And since the nature of the Logos is reasonably believed
to be simple, and exhibits in itself no duplicity or combination, no one would contemplate
the existence of the living Logos as dependent on a mere participation of life, for such a
supposition, which is to say that one thing is within another, would not exclude the idea of
compositeness; but, since the simplicity has been admitted, we are compelled to think that
the Logos has an independent life, and not a mere participation of life. If, then, the Logos,
as being life, lives1944, it certainly has the faculty of will, for no one of living creatures is
without such a faculty. Moreover that such a will has also capacity to act must be the conclusion
of a devout mind. For if you admit not this potency, you prove the reverse to exist.
<note type="footnote">cannot be soft: nor could substance be the term, for then they must have been component parts of the Existent,
which would have destroyed the unity of the Godhead: “therefore, he (Plato) styled them Hypostases or Subsistencies,
which is something between substance and quality, inexisting in the one, and serving as a receptacle for
the other’s inexistency within it.” But he adds, “I do not recommend this explanation to anybody”; nor does he
state the authority for this Platonic use, so lucidly explained, of the word. Indeed, if the word had ever been applied
to the principles of the Platonic triad, to express in the case of each of them “the distinct subsistence in a common
οὐσία,” it would have falsified the very conception of the first, i.e. Goodness, which was never relative. So that
this very word seems to emphasize, so far, the antagonism between Christianity and Platonism. Socrates (E. H.
iii. 7) bears witness to the absence of the word from the ancient Greek philosophy: “it appears to us that the
Greek philosophers have given us various definitions of οὐσία, but have not taken the slightest notice of
ὑπόστασις.…it is not found in any of the ancients except occasionally in a sense quite different from that which
is attached to it at the present day (i.e. fifth century). Thus Sophocles in his tragedy entitled Phoenix uses it to
signify ‘treachery’; in Menander it implies ‘sauces’ (i e. sediment). But although the ancient philosophical writers
scarcely noticed the word, the more modern ones have frequently used it instead of οὐσία.” But it was, as far as
can be traced, the unerring genius of Origen that first threw around the Λόγος that atmosphere of a new term,
i.e. ὑπόστασις, as well as ὁμοούσιος, αὐτόθεος, which afterward made it possible to present the Second Person
to the Greek-speaking world as the member of an equal and indivisible Trinity. It was he who first selected such
words and saw what they were capable of; though he did not insist on that fuller meaning which was put upon
them when all danger within the Church of Sabellianism had disappeared, and error passed in the guise of
Arianism to the opposite extreme.</note>
<note type="footnote">1944 lives. This doctrine is far removed from that of Philo, i.e. from the Alexandrine philosophy. The very
first statement of S. John represents the Λόγος as having a backward movement towards the Deity, as well as a
forward movement from Him; as held there, and yet sent thence by a force which he calls Love, so that the</note>

<pb n="883"/>
But no; impotence is quite removed from our conception of Deity. Nothing of incongruity
<note type="footnote">primal movement towards the world does not come from the Λόγος, but from the Father Himself. The Λόγος
here is the Word, and not the Reason; He is the living effect of a living cause, not a theory or hypothesis standing
at the gateway of an insoluble mystery. The Λόγος speaks because the Father speaks, not because the Supreme
cannot and will not speak; and their relations are often the reverse of those they hold in Philo; for the Father
becomes at times the meditator between the Λόγος and the world drawing men towards Him and subduing
portions of the Creation before His path. Psychology seems to pour a light straight into the Council-chamber
of the Eternal; while Metaphysics had turned away from it, with her finger on her lips. Philo may have used, as
Tholuck thinks, those very texts of the Old Testament which support the Christian doctrine of the Word, and
in the translation of which the LXX. supplied him with the Greek word. But, however derived, his theology
eventually ranged itself with those pantheistic views of the universe which subdued all thinking minds not
Christianized, for more than three centuries after him. The majority of recent critics certainly favour the supposition
that the Λόγος of Philo is a being numerically distinct from the Supreme; but when the relation of the
Supreme is attentively traced in each, the actual antagonism of the Christian system and his begins to be apparent.
The Supreme of Philo is not and can never be related to the world. The Λόγος is a logical necessity as a mediator
between the two; a spiritual being certainly, but only the head of a long series of such beings, who succeed at
last in filling the passage between the finite and the infinite. In this system there is no mission of love and of free
will; such beings are but as the milestones to mark the distance between man and the Great Unknown. It is significant
that Vacherot, the leading historian of the Alexandrine school of philosophy, doubts whether John the
Evangelist ever even heard of the Jewish philosopher of Alexandria. It is pretty much the same with the members
of the Neoplatonic Triad as with the Λόγος of Philo. The God of Plotinus and Proclus is not a God in three hypostases:
he is simply one, Intelligence and Soul being his necessary emanations; they are in God, but they are
not God: Soul is but a hypostasis of a hypostasis. The One is not a hypostasis, but above it. This “Trinity” depends
on the distinction and succession of the necessary movements of the Deity; it consists of three distinct and separate
principles of things. The Trinity is really peculiar to Christianity. Three inseparable Hypostases make
equally a part of the Divine nature, so that to take away one would be to destroy the whole. The Word and
Spirit are Divine, not intermediaries disposed in a hierarchy on the route of the world to God. As Plotinus reproached
the Gnostics, the Christian mysticism despises the world, and suppressing the intermediaries who in
other doctrines serve to elevate the soul gradually to God, it transports it by one impulse as it were into the Divine
nature. The Christian goes straight to God by Faith. The Imagination, Reason, and Contemplation of the Neoplatonists,
i.e. the three movements of the soul which correspond to their lower “trinity” of Nature, Soul, Intelligence,
are no longer necessary. There is an antipathy profound between the two systems; How then could the
one be said to influence the other? Neoplatonism may have tinged Christianity, while it was still seeking for
language in which to express its inner self: but it never influenced the intrinsically moral character of the
Christian Creeds. The Alexandrine philosophy is all metaphysics, and its rock was pantheism; all, even matter,
proceeds from God necessarily and eternally. The Church never hesitated: she saw the abyss that opens upon
that path; and by severe decrees she has closed the way to pantheism.</note>

<pb n="884"/>
is to be observed in connection with the Divine nature, but it is absolutely necessary to admit
that the power of that word is as great as the purpose, lest mixture, or concurrence, of contradictions
be found in an existence that is incomposite, as would be the case if, in the same
purpose, we were to detect both impotence and power, if, that is, there were power to do
one thing, but no power to do something else. Also we must suppose that this will in its
power to do all things will have no tendency to anything that is evil (for impulse towards
evil is foreign to the Divine nature), but that whatever is good, this it also wishes, and,
wishing, is able to perform, and, being able, will not fail to perform1945; but that it will bring
all its proposals for good to effectual accomplishment. Now the world is good, and all its
contents are seen to be wisely and skilfully ordered. All of them, therefore, are the works of
the Word, of one who, while He lives and subsists, in that He is God’s Word, has a will too,
in that He lives; of one too who has power to effect what He wills, and who wills what is
absolutely good and wise and all else that connotes superiority. Whereas, then, the world
is admitted to be something good, and from what has been said the world has been shown
to be the work of the Word, who both wills and is able to effect the good, this Word is other
than He of whom He is the Word. For this, too, to a certain extent is a term of “relation,”
inasmuch as the Father of the Word must needs be thought of with the Word, for it would
not be word were it not a word of some one. If, then, the mind of the hearers, from the relative
meaning of the term, makes a distinction between the Word and Him from whom He
proceeds, we should find that the Gospel mystery, in its contention with the Greek conceptions,
would not be in danger of coinciding with those who prefer the beliefs of the Jews.
But it will equally escape the absurdity of either party, by acknowledging both that the living
Word of God is an effective and creative being, which is what the Jew refuses to receive, and
also that the Word itself, and He from whom He is, do not differ in their nature. As in our
own case we say that the word is from the mind, and no more entirely the same as the mind,
than altogether other than it (for, by its being from it, it is something else, and not it; still
by its bringing the mind in evidence it can no longer be considered as something other than
it; and so it is in its essence one with mind, while as a subject it is different), in like manner,
too, the Word of God by its self-subsistence is distinct from Him from whom it has its
subsistence; and yet by exhibiting in itself those qualities which are recognized in God it is
the same in nature with Him who is recognizable by the same distinctive marks. For
whether one adopts goodness1946, or power, or wisdom, or eternal existence, or the incap-

should be inexhaustible; that nothing should limit its operation, so that it should do no more than it has done.</note>

the obscurity rises from something wrong in our ideas, not from any inconsistencies in the subjects themselves.”

<p>As, then, by the higher mystical ascent1947 from matters that concern ourselves to that
transcendent nature we gain a knowledge of the Word, by the same method we shall be led
on to a conception of the Spirit, by observing in our own nature certain shadows and resemblances
of His ineffable power. Now in us the spirit (or breath) is the drawing of the air, a
matter other than ourselves, inhaled and breathed out for the necessary sustainment of the
body. This, on the occasion of uttering the word, becomes an utterance which expresses in
itself the meaning of the word. And in the case of the Divine nature it has been deemed a
point of our religion that there is a Spirit of God, just as it has been allowed that there is a
Word of God, because of the inconsistency of the Word of God being deficient as compared
with our word, if, while this word of ours is contemplated in connection with spirit, that
other Word were to be believed to be quite unconnected with spirit. Not indeed that it is a
thought proper to entertain of Deity, that after the manner of our breath something foreign
from without flows into God, and in Him becomes the Spirit; but when we think of God’s
Word we do not deem the Word to be something unsubstantial, nor the result of instruction,
nor an utterance of the voice, nor what after being uttered passes away, nor what is subject
to any other condition such as those which are observed in our word, but to be essentially
self-subsisting, with a faculty of will ever-working, all-powerful. The like doctrine have we
received as to God’s Spirit; we regard it as that which goes with the Word and manifests its
energy, and not as a mere effluence of the breath; for by such a conception the grandeur of
the Divine power would be reduced and humiliated, that is, if the Spirit that is in it were

Catech. ii. p. 60) meaning. Speaking of the Tower of Babel, he says that there is a “riddle” in the account. “A
competent exposition will have a more convenient season for dealing with this, when there is a direct necessity
to explain the passage in its higher mystical meaning” (c. Cels. iv. p. 173). Gregory imitates his master in constantly
thus dealing with the Old Testament, i.e. making inductions about the highest spiritual truths from the “history.”
So Basil would treat the prophecies (in Isai. v. p. 948). Chrysostom, on the Songs of “Degrees” in the Psalms,
says that they are so called because they speak of the going up from Babylon, according to history; but, according
to their high mysticism, because they lift us into the way of excellence. Here Gregory uses the facts of human
nature neither in the way of mere analogy nor of allegory: he argues straight from them, as one reality, to another
reality almost of the same class, as it were, as the first, man being “in the image of God”; and so ἀναγωγή here
comes nearer induction than anything else.</note>

supposed to resemble ours. But we conceive of it as an essential power, regarded as selfcentred
in its own proper person, yet equally incapable of being separated from God in
Whom it is, or from the Word of God whom it accompanies, as from melting into nothingness;
but as being, after the likeness of God’s Word, existing as a person1948, able to will,
self-moved, efficient, ever choosing the good, and for its every purpose having its power
concurrent with its will.</p>

which in the last analysis reposes only on the double sense of ὑπόστασις (viz. : (a) real subsistence; (b) individually
independent, not attributive subsistence), could be used with reference to each of the Divine attributes, and so
for the complete restoration of polytheism, Gregory leaves unnoticed.” Yet Gregory doubtless was well aware
of this, for he says, just below, that even a severe study of the mystery can only result in a moderate amount of
apprehension of it.</note>

<p>And so one who severely studies the depths of the mystery, receives secretly in his
spirit, indeed, a moderate amount of apprehension of the doctrine of God’s nature, yet he
is unable to explain clearly in words the ineffable depth of this mystery. As, for instance,
how the same thing is capable of being numbered and yet rejects numeration, how it is observed
with distinctions yet is apprehended as a monad, how it is separate as to personality
yet is not divided as to subject matter1949. For, in personality, the Spirit is one thing and the
Word another, and yet again that from which the Word and Spirit is, another. But when
you have gained the conception of what the distinction is in these, the oneness, again, of
the nature admits not division, so that the supremacy of the one First Cause is not split and
cut up into differing Godships, neither does the statement harmonize with the Jewish dogma,
but the truth passes in the mean between these two conceptions, destroying each heresy,
and yet accepting what is useful to it from each. The Jewish dogma is destroyed by the acceptance
of the Word, and by the belief in the Spirit; while the polytheistic error of the Greek
school is made to vanish by the unity of the Nature abrogating this imagination of plurality.
While yet again, of the Jewish conception, let the unity of the Nature stand; and of the Hellenistic,
only the distinction as to persons; the remedy against a profane view being thus
applied, as required, on either side. For it is as if the number of the triad were a remedy in
the case of those who are in error as to the One, and the assertion of the unity for those
whose beliefs are dispersed among a number of divinities.</p>
<note type="footnote">1949 it is separate as to personality yet is not divided as to subject matter. The words are respectively ὑπόστασις
and ὑποκείμενον. The last word is with Gregory, whose clearness in philosophical distinctions makes his use
of words very observable, always equivalent to οὐσία, and οὐσία generally to φύσις. The following note of Casaubon
(Epist. ad Eustath.) is valuable: In the Holy. Trinity there is neither “confusion,” nor “composition,” nor
“coalescing”; neither the Sabellian “contraction,” any more than the Arian “division,” neither on the other hand
“estrangement,” or “difference.” There is “distinction” or “distribution” without division. This word “distribution”
is used by Tertullian and others to express the effect of the “persons” (ἰδιότητες, ὑποστάσεις, πρόσωπα) upon
the Godhead which forms the definition of the substance (ὁ τῆς οὐσίας λόγος).</note>

<p>But should it be the Jew who gainsays these arguments, our discussion with him will
no longer present equal difficulty1950, since the truth will be made manifest out of those
doctrines on which he has been brought up. For that there is a Word of God, and a Spirit
of God, powers essentially subsisting, both creative of whatever has come into being, and
comprehensive of things that exist, is shown in the clearest light out of the Divinely-inspired
Scriptures. It is enough if we call to mind one testimony, and leave the discovery of more
to those who are inclined to take the trouble. “By the Word of the Lord,” it is said, “the
heavens were established, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth1951.” What
word and what breath? For the Word is not mere speech, nor that breath mere breathing.
Would not the Deity be brought down to the level of the likeness of our human nature, were
it held as a doctrine that the Maker of the universe used such word and such breath as this?
What power arising from speech or breathing could there be of such a kind as would suffice
for the establishment of the heavens and the powers that are therein? For if the Word of
God is like our speech, and His Breath is like our breath, then from these like things there
must certainly come a likeness of power; and the Word of God has just so much force as
our word, and no more. But the words that come from us and the breath that accompanies
their utterance are ineffective and unsubstantial. Thus, they who would bring down the
Deity to a similarity with the word as with us render also the Divine word and spirit altogether
ineffective and unsubstantial. But if, as David says, “By the Word of the Lord were
the heavens established, and their powers had their framing by His breath,” then has the
mystery of the truth been confirmed, which instructs us to speak of a word as in essential
being, and a breath as in personality.</p>

<p>That there is, then, a Word of God, and a Breath of God, the Greek, with his “innate
ideas”1952, and the Jew, with his Scriptures, will perhaps not deny. But the dispensation as
regards the Word of God, whereby He became man, both parties would perhaps equally
reject, as being incredible and unfitting to be told of God. By starting, therefore, from another
point we will bring these gainsayers to a belief in this fact. They believe that all things came
into being by thought and skill on the part of Him Who framed the system of the universe;
or else they hold views that do not conform to this opinion. But should they not grant that
reason and wisdom guided the framing of the world, they will install unreason and unskilfulness
on the throne of the universe. But if this is an absurdity and impiety, it is abundantly
plain that they must allow that thought and skill rule the world. Now in what has been previously
said, the Word of God has been shown not to be this actual utterance of speech, or
the possession of some science or art, but to be a power essentially and substantially existing,
willing all good, and being possessed of strength to execute all its will; and, of a world that
is good, this power appetitive and creative of good is the cause. If, then, the subsistence of
the whole world has been made to depend on the power of the Word, as the train of the argument
has shown, an absolute necessity prevents us entertaining the thought of there being
any other cause of the organization of the several parts of the world than the Word Himself,
through whom all things in it passed into being. If any one wants to call Him Word, or Skill,
or Power, or God, or anything else that is high and prized, we will not quarrel with him.
For whatever word or name be invented as descriptive of the subject, one thing is intended
by the expressions, namely the eternal power of God which is creative of things that are, the
discoverer of things that are not, the sustaining cause of things that are brought into being,
the foreseeing cause of things yet to be. This, then, whether it be God, or Word, or Skill, or
Power, has been shown by inference to be the Maker of the nature of man, not urged to
framing him by any necessity, but in the superabundance of love operating the production
of such a creature. For needful it was that neither His light should be unseen, nor His glory
without witness, nor His goodness unenjoyed, nor that any other quality observed in the
Divine nature should in any case lie idle, with none to share it or enjoy it. If, therefore, man
comes to his birth upon these conditions, namely to be a partaker of the good things in God,
necessarily he is framed of such a kind as to be adapted to the participation of such good.
For as the eye, by virtue of the bright ray which is by nature wrapped up in it, is in fellowship
with the light, and by its innate capacity draws to itself that which is akin to it, so was it
needful that a certain affinity with the Divine should be mingled with the nature of man, in
order that by means of this correspondence it might aim at that which was native to it. It is

thus even with the nature of the unreasoning creatures, whose lot is cast in water or in air;
each of them has an organization adapted to its kind of life, so that by a peculiar formation
of the body, to the one of them the air, to the other the water, is its proper and congenial
element. Thus, then, it was needful for man, born for the enjoyment of Divine good, to have
something in his nature akin to that in which he is to participate. For this end he has been
furnished with life, with thought, with skill, and with all the excellences that we attribute to
God, in order that by each of them he might have his desire set upon that which is not
strange to him. Since, then, one of the excellences connected with the Divine nature is also
eternal existence, it was altogether needful that the equipment of our nature should not be
without the further gift of this attribute, but should have in itself the immortal, that by its
inherent faculty it might both recognize what is above it, and be possessed with a desire for
the divine and eternal life1953. In truth this has been shown in the comprehensive utterance
of one expression, in the description of the cosmogony, where it is said that man was made
“in the image of God”1954. For in this likeness, implied in the word image, there is a summary
of all things that characterize Deity; and whatever else Moses relates, in a style more in the
way of history, of these matters, placing doctrines before us in the form of a story, is connected
with the same instruction. For that Paradise of his, with its peculiar fruits, the eating of
which did not afford to them who tasted thereof satisfaction of the appetite, but knowledge
and eternity of life, is in entire agreement with what has been previously considered with
regard to man, in the view that our nature at its beginnings was good, and in the midst of
good. But, perhaps, what has been said will be contradicted by one who looks only to the
present condition of things, and thinks to convict our statement of untruthfulness, inasmuch
as man is seen no longer under those primeval circumstances, but under almost entirely
opposite ones. “Where is the divine resemblance in the soul? Where the body’s freedom
from suffering? Where the eternity of life? Man is of brief existence, subject to passions, liable
to decay, and ready both in body and mind for every form of suffering.” By these and the
like assertions, and by directing the attack against human nature, the opponent will think
that he upsets the account that has been offered respecting man. But to secure that our argument
may not have to be diverted from its course at any future stage, we will briefly discuss
these points. That the life of man is at present subject to abnormal conditions is no proof
that man was not created in the midst of good. For since man is the work of God, Who
through His goodness brought this creature into being, no one could reasonably suspect
that he, of whose constitution goodness is the cause, was created by his Maker in the midst

of evil. But there is another reason for our present circumstances being what they are, and
for our being destitute of the primitive surroundings: and yet again the starting-point of
our answer to this argument against us is not beyond and outside the assent of our opponents.
For He who made man for the participation of His own peculiar good, and incorporated in
him the instincts for all that was excellent, in order that his desire might be carried forward
by a corresponding movement in each case to its like, would never have deprived him of
that most excellent and precious of all goods; I mean the gift implied in being his own
master, and having a free will. For if necessity in any way was the master of the life of man,
the “image” would have been falsified in that particular part, by being estranged owing to
this unlikeness to its archetype. How can that nature which is under a yoke and bondage to
any kind of necessity be called an image of a Master Being? Was it not, then, most right that
that which is in every detail made like the Divine should possess in its nature a self-ruling
and independent principle, such as to enable the participation of good to be the reward of
its virtue? Whence, then, comes it, you will ask, that he who had been distinguished
throughout with most excellent endowments exchanged these good things for the worse?
The reason of this also is plain. No growth of evil had its beginning in the Divine will. Vice
would have been blameless were it inscribed with the name of God as its maker and father.
But the evil is, in some way or other, engendered1955 from within, springing up in the will
at that moment when there is a retrocession of the soul from the beautiful1956. For as sight
is an activity of nature, and blindness a deprivation of that natural operation, such is the
kind of opposition between virtue and vice. It is, in fact, not possible to form any other notion
of the origin of vice than as the absence of virtue. For as when the light has been removed
the darkness supervenes, but as long as it is present there is no darkness, so, as long as the
good is present in the nature, vice is a thing that has no inherent existence; while the departure
of the better state becomes the origin of its opposite. Since then, this is the peculiarity
of the possession of a free will, that it chooses as it likes the thing that pleases it, you will
find that it is not God Who is the author of the present evils, seeing that He has ordered
your nature so as to be its own master and free; but rather the recklessness that makes choice
of the worse in preference to the better.</p>

<p>But you will perhaps seek to know the cause of this error of judgment; for it is to this
point that the train of our discussion tends. Again, then, we shall be justified in expecting
to find some starting-point which will throw light on this inquiry also. An argument such
as the following we have received by tradition from the Fathers; and this argument is no
mere mythical narrative, but one that naturally invites our credence. Of all existing things
there is a twofold manner of apprehension, the consideration of them being divided between
what appertains to intellect and what appertains to the senses; and besides these there is
nothing to be detected in the nature of existing things, as extending beyond this division.
Now these two worlds have been separated from each other by a wide interval, so that the
sensible is not included in those qualities which mark the intellectual, nor this last in those
qualities which distinguish the sensible, but each receives its formal character from qualities
opposite to those of the other. The world of thought is bodiless, impalpable, and figureless;
but the sensible is, by its very name, bounded by those perceptions which come through the
organs of sense. But as in the sensible world itself, though there is a considerable mutual
opposition of its various elements, yet a certain harmony maintained in those opposites has
been devised by the wisdom that rules the Universe, and thus there is produced a concord
of the whole creation with itself, and the natural contrariety does not break the chain of
agreement; in like manner, owing to the Divine wisdom, there is an admixture and interpenetration
of the sensible with the intellectual department, in order that all things may equally
have a share in the beautiful, and no single one of existing things be without its share in that
superior world. For this reason the corresponding locality of the intellectual world is a
subtitle and mobile essence, which, in accordance with its supramundane habitation, has
in its peculiar nature large affinity with the intellectual part. Now, by a provision of the supreme
Mind there is an intermixture of the intellectual with the sensible world, in order
that nothing in creation may be thrown aside1957 as worthless, as says the Apostle, or be
left without its portion of the Divine fellowship. On this account it is that the commixture
of the intellectual and sensible in man is effected by the Divine Being, as the description of
the cosmogony instructs us. It tells us that God, taking dust of the ground, formed the man,
and by an inspiration from Himself He planted life in the work of His hand, that thus the
earthy might be raised up to the Divine, and so one certain grace of equal value might pervade
the whole creation, the lower nature being mingled with the supramundane. Since, then,
the intellectual nature had a previous existence, and to each of the angelic powers a certain
operation was assigned, for the organization of the whole, by the authority that presides
over all things, there was a certain power ordained to hold together and sway the earthly
<note type="footnote">1957 1 Tim. iv. 4; “rejected” (R.V.), better than “refused” (A.V.).</note>

<pb n="894"/>
region1958, constituted for this purpose by the power that administers the Universe. Upon
that there was fashioned that thing moulded of earth, an “image” copied from the superior
Power. Now this living being was man. In him, by an ineffable influence, the godlike beauty
of the intellectual nature was mingled. He to whom the administration of the earth has been
consigned takes it ill and thinks it not to be borne, if, of that nature which has been subjected
to him, any being shall be exhibited bearing likeness to his transcendent dignity. But the
question, how one who had been created for no evil purpose by Him who framed the system
of the Universe in goodness fell away, nevertheless, into this passion of envy, it is not a part
of my present business minutely to discuss; though it would not be difficult, and it would
not take long, to offer an account to those who are amenable to persuasion. For the distinctive
difference between virtue and vice is not to be contemplated as that between two actually
subsisting phenomena; but as there is a logical opposition between that which is and that
which is not, and it is not possible to say that, as regards subsistency, that which is not is
distinguished from that which is, but we say that nonentity is only logically opposed to entity,
in the same way also the word vice is opposed to the word virtue, not as being any existence
in itself, but only as becoming thinkable by the absence of the better. As we say that blindness
is logically opposed to sight, not that blindness has of itself a natural existence, being only
a deprivation of a preceding faculty, so also we say that vice is to be regarded as the
deprivation of goodness, just as a shadow which supervenes at the passage of the solar ray.
Since, then, the uncreated nature is incapable of admitting of such movement as is implied
in turning or change or alteration, while everything that subsists through creation has connection
with change, inasmuch as the subsistence itself of the creation had its rise in change,
that which was not passing by the Divine power into that which is; and since the abovementioned
power was created too, and could choose by a spontaneous movement whatever
he liked, when he had closed his eyes to the good and the ungrudging like one who in the

and atmosphere of the earth were assigned to “angelic powers,” so the Earth itself and her nations were assigned
to subordinate angels. Origen had already developed, or rather christianized, this doctrine. Speaking of the
Confusion of Tongues, he says, “And so each (nation) had to be handed over to the keeping of angels more or
less severe, and of this character or of that, according as each had moved a greater or less distance from the East,
and had prepared more or less bricks for stone, and more or less slime for mortar; and had built up more or
less. This was that they might be punished for their boldness. These angels who had already created for each
nation its peculiar tongue, were to lead their charges into various parts according to their deserts: one for instance
to some burning clime, another to one which would chastise the dwellers in it with its freezing:…those who retained
the original speech through not having moved from the East are the only ones that became ‘the portion
of the Lord.’…They, too, alone are to be considered as having been under a ruler who did not take them in hand
to be punished as the others were’ (c. Cels. v. 30–1).</note>

sunshine lets his eyelids down upon his eyes and sees only darkness, in this way that being
also, by his very unwillingness to perceive the good, became cognisant of the contrary to
goodness. Now this is Envy. Well, it is undeniable that the beginning of any matter is the
cause of everything else that by consequence follows upon it, as, for instance, upon health
there follows a good habit of body, activity, and a pleasurable life, but upon sickness, weakness,
want of energy, and life passed in distaste of everything; and so, in all other instances,
things follow by consequence their proper beginnings. As, then, freedom from the agitation
of the passions is the beginning and groundwork of a life in accordance with virtue, so the
bias to vice generated by that Envy is the constituted road to all these evils which have been
since displayed. For when once he, who by his apostacy from goodness had begotten in
himself this Envy, had received this bias to evil1959, like a rock, torn asunder from a mountain
ridge, which is driven down headlong by its own weight, in like manner he, dragged away
from his original natural propension to goodness and gravitating with all his weight in the
direction of vice, was deliberately forced and borne away as by a kind of gravitation to the
utmost limit of iniquity; and as for that intellectual power which he had received from his
Creator to co-operate with the better endowments, this he made his assisting instrument
in the discovery of contrivances for the purposes of vice, while by his crafty skill he deceives
and circumvents man, persuading him to become his own murderer with his own hands.
For seeing that man by the commission of the Divine blessing had been elevated to a lofty
pre-eminence (for he was appointed king over the earth and all things on it; he was beautiful
in his form, being created an image of the archetypal beauty; he was without passion in his
nature, for he was an imitation of the unimpassioned; he was full of frankness, delighting
in a face-to-face manifestation of the personal Deity),—all this was to the adversary the fuel
to his passion of envy. Yet could he not by any exercise of strength or dint of force accomplish
his purpose, for the strength of God’s blessing over-mastered his own force. His plan,
therefore, is to withdraw man from this enabling strength, that thus he may be easily captured
by him and open to his treachery. As in a lamp when the flame has caught the wick and a
person is unable to blow it out, he mixes water with the oil and by this devices will dull the
flame, in the same way the enemy, by craftily mixing up badness in man’s will, has produced
a kind of extinguishment and dulness in the blessing, on the failure of which that which is

<p>Yet let no one ask, “How was it that, if God foresaw the misfortune that would happen
to man from want of thought, He came to create him, since it was, perhaps, more to his
advantage not to have been born than to be in the midst of such evils?” This is what they
who have been carried away by the false teaching of the Manichees put forward for the establishment
of their error, as thus able to show that the Creator of human nature is evil. For
if God is not ignorant of anything that is, and yet man is in the midst of evil, the argument
for the goodness of God could not be upheld; that is, if He brought forth into life the man
who was to be in this evil. For if the operating force which is in accordance with the good
is entirely that of a nature which is good, then this painful and perishing life, they say, can
never be referred to the workmanship of the good, but it is necessary to suppose for such a
life as this another author, from whom our nature derives its tendency to misery. Now all
these and the like assertions seem to those who are thoroughly imbued with the heretical
fraud, as with some deeply ingrained stain, to have a certain force from their superficial
plausibility. But they who have a more thorough insight into the truth clearly perceive that
what they say is unsound, and admits of speedy demonstration of its fallacy. In my opinion,
too, it is well to put forward the Apostle as pleading with us on these points for their condemnation.
In his address to the Corinthians he makes a distinction between the carnal and
spiritual dispositions of souls; showing, I think, by what he says that it is wrong to judge of
what is morally excellent, or, on the other hand, of what is evil, by the standard of the senses;
but that, by withdrawing the mind from bodily phenomena, we must decide by itself and
from itself the true nature of moral excellence and of its opposite. “The spiritual man,” he
says, “judgeth all things1960.” This, I think, must have been the reason of the invention of
these deceptive doctrines on the part of those who propound them, viz. that when they
define the good they have an eye only to the sweetness of the body’s enjoyment, and so,
because from its composite nature and constant tendency to dissolution that body is unavoidably
subject to suffering and sicknesses, and because upon such conditions of suffering
there follows a sort of sense of pain, they decree that the formation of man is the work of
an evil deity. Since, if their thoughts had taken a loftier view, and, withdrawing their minds
from this disposition to regard the gratifications of the senses, they had looked at the nature
of existing things dispassionately, they would have understood that there is no evil other
than wickedness. Now all wickedness has its form and character in the deprivation of the
good; it exists not by itself, and cannot be contemplated as a subsistence. For no evil of any
kind lies outside and independent of the will; but it is the non-existence of the good that is
so denominated. Now that which is not has no substantial existence, and the Maker of that
which has no substantial existence is not the Maker of things that have substantial existence.

Therefore the God of things that are is external to the causation of things that are evil, since
He is not the Maker of things that are non-existent. He Who formed the sight did not make
blindness. He Who manifested virtue manifested not the deprivation thereof. He Who has
proposed as the prize in the contest of a free will the guerdon of all good to those who are
living virtuously, never, to please Himself, subjected mankind to the yoke of a strong compulsion,
as if he would drag it unwilling, as it were his lifeless tool, towards the right. But if,

of evil that our being should be quenched by this condition of mortality. Let him,
then, observe through this gloomy prospect the excess of the Divine benevolence. He may
by this, perhaps, be the more induced to admire the graciousness of God’s care for the affairs
of man. To live is desirable to those who partake of life, on account of the enjoyment of
things to their mind; since, if any one lives in bodily pain, not to be is deemed by such an
one much more desirable than to exist in pain. Let us inquire, then, whether He Who gives
us our outfit for living has any other object in view than how we may pass our life under
the fairest circumstances. Now since by a motion of our self-will we contracted a fellowship
with evil, and, owing to some sensual gratification, mixed up this evil with our nature like
some deleterious ingredient spoiling the taste of honey, and so, falling away from that
blessedness which is involved in the thought of passionlessness, we have been viciously
transformed—for this reason, Man, like some earthen potsherd, is resolved again into the
dust of the ground, in order to secure that he may part with the soil which he has now contracted,
and that he may, through the resurrection, be reformed anew after the original
pattern; at least if in this life that now is he has preserved what belongs to that image. A
doctrine such as this is set before us by Moses under the disguise of an historical manner1961.
And yet this disguise of history contains a teaching which is most plain. For after, as he tells
us, the earliest of mankind were brought into contact with what was forbidden, and thereby
were stripped naked of that primal blessed condition, the Lord clothed these, His first-formed
creatures, with coats of skins. In my opinion we are not bound to take these skins in their
literal meaning. For to what sort of slain and flayed animals did this clothing devised for
these humanities belong? But since all skin, after it is separated from the animal, is dead, I
am certainly of opinion that He Who is the healer of our sinfulness, of His foresight invested
man subsequently with that capacity of dying which had been the special attribute of the
brute creation. Not that it was to last for ever; for a coat is something external put on us,
lending itself to the body for a time, but not indigenous to its nature. This liability to death,
then, taken from the brute creation, was, provisionally, made to envelope the nature created
for immortality. It enwrapped it externally, but not internally. It grasped the sentient part
of man; but laid no hold upon the Divine image. This sentient part, however, does not disappear,
but is dissolved. Disappearance is the passing away into non-existence, but dissolution
is the dispersion again into those constituent elements of the world of which it was composed.
But that which is contained in them perishes not, though it escapes the cognisance of our
senses.</p>
<note type="footnote">1961 ἱστορικώτερον καὶ δι᾽ αἰνιγμάτων</note>

<pb n="900"/>
<p>Now the cause of this dissolution is evident from the illustration we have given of it.
For since the senses have a close connection with what is gross and earthy, while the intellect
is in its nature of a nobler and more exalted character than the movements involved in
sensation, it follows that as, through the estimate which is made by the senses, there is an
erroneous judgment as to what is morally good, and this error has wrought the effect of
substantiating a contrary condition, that part of us which has thus been made useless is
dissolved by its reception of this contrary. Now the bearing of our illustration is as follows.
We supposed that some vessel has been composed of clay, and then, for some mischief or
other, filled with melted lead, which lead hardens and remains in a non-liquid state; then
that the owner of the vessel recovers it, and, as he possesses the potter’s art, pounds to bits
the ware which held the lead, and then remoulds the vessel after its former pattern for his
own special use, emptied now of the material which had been mixed with it: by a like process
the maker of our vessel, now that wickedness has intermingled with our sentient part, I
mean that connected with the body, will dissolve the material which has received the evil,
and, re-moulding it again by the Resurrection without any admixture of the contrary matter,
will recombine the elements into the vessel in its original beauty. Now since both soul and
body have a common bond of fellowship in their participation of the sinful affections, there
is also an analogy between the soul’s and body’s death. For as in regard to the flesh we pronounce
the separation of the sentient life to be death, so in respect of the soul we call the
departure of the real life death. While, then, as we have said before, the participation in evil
observable both in soul and body is of one and the same character, for it is through both
that the evil principle advances into actual working, the death of dissolution which came
from that clothing of dead skins does not affect the soul. For how can that which is uncompounded
be subject to dissolution? But since there is a necessity that the defilements which
sin has engendered in the soul as well should be removed thence by some remedial process,
the medicine which virtue supplies has, in the life that now is, been applied to the healing
of such mutilations as these. If, however, the soul remains unhealed1962, the remedy is dispensed
in the life that follows this. Now in the ailments of the body there are sundry differences,
some admitting of an easier, others requiring a more difficult treatment. In these last
the use of the knife, or cauteries, or draughts of bitter medicines are adopted to remove the
disease that has attacked the body. For the healing of the soul’s sicknesses the future judgment
announces something of the same kind, and this to the thoughtless sort is held out as the
<note type="footnote">1962 “Here,” says Semler, “our Author reveals himself as a scholar of Origen, and other doctors, who had
imbibed the heathen thoughts of Plato, and wished to rest their system upon a future (purely) moral improvement.”
There is certainly too little room left here for the application to the soul and body in this life of Christ’s
atonement.</note>

<pb n="901"/>
threat of a terrible correction1963, in order that through fear of this painful retribution they
may gain the wisdom of fleeing from wickedness: while by those of more intelligence it is
believed to be a remedial process ordered by God to bring back man, His peculiar creature,
to the grace of his primal condition. They who use the knife or cautery to remove certain
unnatural excrescences in the body, such as wens or warts, do not bring to the person they
are serving a method of healing that is painless, though certainly they apply the knife without
any intention of injuring the patient. In like manner whatever material excrescences are
hardening on our souls, that have been sensualized by fellowship with the body’s affections,
are, in the day of the judgment1964, as it were cut and scraped away by the ineffable wisdom
and power of Him Who, as the Gospel says, “healeth those that are sick1965.” For, as He
says again, “they that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick1966.”
Since, then, there has been inbred in the soul a strong natural tendency to evil, it must suffer,
just as the excision of a wart1967 gives a sharp pain to the skin of the body; for whatever
contrary to the nature has been inbred in the nature attaches itself to the subject in a certain
union of feeling, and hence there is produced an abnormal intermixture of our own with
an alien quality, so that the feelings, when the separation from this abnormal growth comes,
are hurt and lacerated. Thus when the soul pines and melts away under the correction of
its sins, as prophecy somewhere tells us1968, there necessarily follow, from its deep and intimate
connection with evil, certain unspeakable and inexpressible pangs, the description
of which is as difficult to render as is that of the nature of those good things which are the
subjects of our hope. For neither the one nor the other is capable of being expressed in
words, or brought within reach of the understanding. If, then, any one looks to the ultimate

aim of the Wisdom of Him Who directs the economy of the universe, he would be very
unreasonable and narrow-minded to call the Maker of man the Author of evil; or to say that
He is ignorant of the future, or that, if He knows it and has made him, He is not uninfluenced
by the impulse to what is bad. He knew what was going to be, yet did not prevent the tendency
towards that which actually happened. That humanity, indeed, would be diverted from the
good, could not be unknown to Him Who grasps all things by His power of foresight, and
Whose eyes behold the coming equally with the past events. As, then, He had in sight the
perversion, so He devised man’s recall to good. Accordingly, which was the better
way?—never to have brought our nature into existence at all, since He foresaw that the being
about to be created would fall away from that which is morally beautiful; or to bring him
back by repentance, and restore his diseased nature to its original beauty? But, because of
the pains and sufferings of the body which are the necessary accidents of its unstable nature,
to call God on that account the Maker of evil, or to think that He is not the Creator of man
at all, in hopes thereby to prevent the supposition of His being the Author of what gives us
pain,—all this is an instance of that extreme narrow-mindedness which is the mark of those
who judge of moral good and moral evil by mere sensation. Such persons do not understand
that that only is intrinsically good which sensation does not reach, and that the only evil is
estrangement from the good. But to make pains and pleasures the criterion of what is morally
good and the contrary, is a characteristic of the unreasoning nature of creatures in whom,
from their want of mind and understanding, the apprehension of real goodness has no place.
That man is the work of God, created morally noble and for the noblest destiny, is evident
not only from what has been said, but from a vast number of other proofs; which, because
they are so many, we shall here omit. But when we call God the Maker of man we do not
forget how carefully at the outset1969 we defined our position against the Greeks. It was
there shown that the Word of God is a substantial and personified being, Himself both God
and the Word; Who has embraced in Himself all creative power, or rather Who is very
power with an impulse to all good; Who works out effectually whatever He wills by having
a power concurrent with His will; Whose will and work is the life of all things that exist; by
Whom, too, man was brought into being and adorned with the highest excellences after the
fashion of Deity. But since that alone is unchangeable in its nature which does not derive
its origin through creation, while whatever by the uncreated being is brought into existence
out of what was nonexistent, from the very first moment that it begins to be, is ever passing
through change, and if it acts according to its nature the change is ever to the better, but if
it be diverted from the straight path, then a movement to the contrary succeeds,—since, I
say, man was thus conditioned, and in him the changeable element in his nature had slipped
aside to the exact contrary, so that this departure from the good introduced in its train every

form of evil to match the good (as, for instance, on the defection of life there was brought
in the antagonism of death; on the deprivation of light darkness supervened; in the absence
of virtue vice arose in its place, and against every form of good might be reckoned a like
number of opposite evils), by whom, I ask, was man, fallen by his recklessness into this and
the like evil state (for it was not possible for him to retain even his prudence when he had
estranged himself from prudence, or to take any wise counsel when he had severed himself
from wisdom),—by whom was man to be recalled to the grace of his original state? To whom
belonged the restoration of the fallen one, the recovery of the lost, the leading back the
wanderer by the hand? To whom else than entirely to Him Who is the Lord of his nature?
For Him only Who at the first had given the life was it possible, or fitting, to recover it when
lost. This is what we are taught and learn from the Revelation of the truth, that God in the
beginning made man and saved him when he had fallen.</p>

<p>Up to this point, perhaps, one who has followed the course of our argument will agree
with it, inasmuch as it does not seem to him that anything has been said which is foreign
to the proper conception of the Deity. But towards what follows and constitutes the strongest
part of this Revelation of the truth, he will not be similarly disposed; the human birth, I
mean, the growth of infancy to maturity, the eating and drinking, the fatigue and sleep, the
sorrow and tears, the false accusation and judgment hall, the cross of death and consignment
to the tomb. All these things, included as they are in this revelation, to a certain extent blunt
the faith of the more narrow-minded, and so they reject the sequel itself in consequence of
these antecedents. They will not allow that in the Resurrection from the dead there is anything
consistent with the Deity, because of the unseemly circumstances of the Death. Well, I deem
it necessary first of all to remove our thoughts for a moment from the grossness of the carnal
element, and to fix them on what is morally beautiful in itself, and on what is not, and on
the distinguishing marks by which each of them is to be apprehended. No one, I think, who
has reflected will challenge the assertion that, in the whole nature of things, one thing only
is disgraceful, and that is vicious weakness; while whatever has no connection with vice is
a stranger to all disgrace; and whatever has no mixture in it of disgrace is certainly to be
found on the side of the beautiful; and what is really beautiful has in it no mixture of its
opposite. Now whatever is to be regarded as coming within the sphere of the beautiful becomes
the character of God. Either, then, let them show that there was viciousness in His
birth, His bringing up, His growth, His progress to the perfection of His nature, His experience
of death and return from death; or, if they allow that the aforesaid circumstances of
His life remain outside the sphere of viciousness, they will perforce admit that there is
nothing of disgrace in this that is foreign to viciousness. Since, then, what is thus removed
from every disgraceful and vicious quality is abundantly shown to be morally beautiful, how
can one fail to pity the folly of men who give it as their opinion that what is morally beautiful
is not becoming in the case of God?</p>

<p>“But the nature of man,” it is said, “is narrow and circumscribed, whereas the Deity is
infinite. How could the infinite be included in the atom1970?” But who is it that says the
infinitude of the Deity is comprehended in the envelopment of the flesh as if it were in a
vessel? Not even in the case of our own life is the intellectual nature shut up within the
boundary of the flesh. On the contrary, while the body’s bulk is limited to the proportions
peculiar to it, the soul by the movements of its thinking faculty can coincide1971 at will with
the whole of creation. It ascends to the heavens, and sets foot within the deep. It traverses
the breadth of the world, and in the restlessness of its curiosity makes its way into the regions
that are beneath the earth; and often it is occupied in the scrutiny of the wonders of heaven,
and feels no weight from the appendage1972 of the body. If, then, the soul of man, although
by the necessity of its nature it is transfused through the body, yet presents itself everywhere
at will, what necessity is there for saying that the Deity is hampered by an environment of
fleshly nature, and why may we not, by examples which we are capable of understanding,
gain some reasonable idea of God’s plan of salvation? There is an analogy, for instance, in
the flame of a lamp, which is seen to embrace the material with which it is supplied1973.
Reason makes a distinction between the flame upon the material, and the material that
kindles the flame, though in fact it is not possible to cut off the one from the other so as to
exhibit the flame separate from the material, but they both united form one single thing.
But let no one, I beg, associate also with this illustration the idea of the perishableness of
the flame; let him accept only what is apposite in the image; what is irrelevant and incongruous
let him reject. What is there, then, to prevent our thinking (just as we see flame fastening

<p>Should you, however, ask in what way Deity is mingled with humanity, you will have
occasion for a preliminary inquiry as to what the coalescence is of soul with flesh. But supposing
you are ignorant of the way in which the soul is in union with the body, do not suppose
that that other question is bound to come within your comprehension; rather, as in
this case of the union of soul and body, while we have reason to believe that the soul is
something other than the body, because the flesh when isolated from the soul becomes dead
and inactive, we have yet no exact knowledge of the method of the union, so in that other
inquiry of the union of Deity with manhood, while we are quite aware that there is a distinction
as regards degree of majesty between the Divine and the mortal perishable nature, we
are not capable of detecting how the Divine and the human elements are mixed up together.
The miracles recorded permit us not to entertain a doubt1975 that God was born in the
nature of man. But how—this, as being a subject unapproachable by the processes of reasoning,
we decline to investigate. For though we believe, as we do, that all the corporeal and
intellectual creation derives its subsistence from the incorporeal and uncreated Being, yet
the whence or the how, these we do not make a matter for examination along with our faith
in the thing itself. While we accept the fact, we pass by the manner of the putting together
of the Universe, as a subject which must not be curiously handled, but one altogether ineffable
and inexplicable.</p>

<p>If a person requires proofs of God’s having been manifested to us in the flesh, let him
look at the Divine activities. For of the existence of the Deity at all one can discover no
other demonstration than that which the testimony of those activities supplies. When, that
is, we take a wide survey of the universe, and consider the dispensations throughout the
world, and the Divine benevolences that operate in our life, we grasp the conception of a
power overlying all, that is creative of all things that come into being, and is conservative
of them as they exist. On the same principle, as regards the manifestation of God in the
flesh, we have established a satisfactory proof of that apparition of Deity, in those wonders
of His operations; for in all his work as actually recorded we recognize the characteristics
of the Divine nature. It belongs to God to give life to men, to uphold by His providence all
things that exist. It belongs to God to bestow meat and drink on those who in the flesh have
received from Him the boon of life, to benefit the needy, to bring back to itself, by means
of renewed health, the nature that has been perverted by sickness. It belongs to God to rule
with equal sway the whole of creation; earth, sea, air, and the realms above the air. It is His
to have a power that is sufficient for all things, and above all to be stronger than death and
corruption. Now if in any one of these or the like particulars the record of Him had been
wanting, they who are external to the faith had reasonably taken exception1976 to the gospel
revelation. But if every notion that is conceivable of God is to be traced in what is recorded

<p>But, it is said, to be born and to die are conditions peculiar to the fleshly nature. I admit
it. But what went before that Birth and what came after that Death escapes the mark of our
common humanity. If we look to either term of our human life, we understand both from
what we take our beginning, and in what we end. Man commenced his existence in a
weakness and in a weakness completes it. But in the instance of the Incarnation neither did
the birth begin with a weakness, nor in a weakness did the death terminate; for neither did
sensual pleasure go before the birth, nor did corruption follow upon the death. Do you
disbelieve this marvel? I quite welcome your incredulity. You thus entirely admit that those
marvellous facts are supernatural, in the very way that you think that what is related is above
belief. Let this very fact, then, that the proclamation of the mystery did not proceed in terms
that are natural, be a proof to you of the manifestation of the Deity. For if what is related of
Christ were within the bounds of nature, where were the Godhead? But if the account surpasses
nature, then the very facts which you disbelieve are a demonstration that He who
was thus proclaimed was God. A man is begotten by the conjunction of two persons, and
after death is left in corruption. Had the Gospel comprised no more than this, you certainly
would not have deemed him to be God, the testimony to whom was conveyed in terms peculiar
only to our nature. But when you are told that He was born, and yet transcended our
common humanity both in the manner of His birth, and by His incapacity of a change to
corruption, it would be well if, in consequence of this, you would direct your incredulity
upon the other point, so as to refuse to suppose Him to be one of those who have manifestly
existed as mere men; for it follows of necessity that a person who does not believe that such
and such a being is mere man, must be led on to the belief that He is God. Well, he who has
recorded that He was born has related also that He was born of a Virgin. If, therefore, on
the evidence stated, the fact of His being born is established as a matter of faith, it is altogether
incredible, on the same evidence, that He was not born in the manner stated. For the author
who mentions His birth adds also, that it was of a Virgin; and in recording His death bears
further testimony to His resurrection from the dead. If, therefore, from what you are told,
you grant that He both was born and died, on the same grounds you must admit that both
His birth and death were independent of the conditions of human weakness,—in fact, were
above nature. The conclusion, therefore, is that He Who has thus been shown to have been
born under supernatural circumstances was certainly Himself not limited by nature.</p>

<p>Even to this objection we are not at a loss for an answer consistent with our idea of God.
You ask the reason why God was born among men. If you take away from life the benefits
that come to us from God, you would not be able to tell me what means you have of arriving
at any knowledge of Deity. In the kindly treatment of us we recognize the benefactor; that
is, from observation of that which happens to us, we conjecture the disposition of the person
who operates it. If, then, love of man be a special characteristic of the Divine nature, here
is the reason for which you are in search, here is the cause of the presence of God among
men. Our diseased nature needed a healer. Man in his fall needed one to set him upright.
He who had lost the gift of life stood in need of a life-giver, and he who had dropped away
from his fellowship with good wanted one who would lead him back to good. He who was
shut up in darkness longed for the presence of the light. The captive sought for a ransomer,
the fettered prisoner for some one to take his part, and for a deliverer he who was held in
the bondage of slavery. Were these, then, trifling or unworthy wants to importune the Deity
to come down and take a survey of the nature of man, when mankind was so miserably and
pitiably conditioned? “But,” it is replied, “man might have been benefited, and yet God
might have continued in a passionless state. Was it not possible for Him Who in His wisdom
framed the universe, and by the simple impulse of His will brought into subsistence that
which was not, had it so pleased Him, by means of some direct Divine command to withdraw
man from the reach of the opposing power, and bring him back to his primal state?
Whereas He waits for long periods of time to come round, He submits Himself to the condition
of a human body, He enters upon the stage of life by being born, and after passing
through each age of life in succession, and then tasting death, at last, only by the rising again
of His own body, accomplishes His object,—as if it was not optional to Him to fulfil His
purpose without leaving the height of His Divine glory, and to save man by a single com-
mand1977, letting those long periods of time alone.” Needful, therefore, is it that in answer
to objections such as these we should draw out the counter-statement of the truth, in order
that no obstacle may be offered to the faith of those persons who will minutely examine the
<note type="footnote">1977 Origin answering the same objections says, “I know not what sort of alteration of mankind it is that
Celsus wants, when he doubts whether it were not possible to improve man by a display of Divine power, without
any one being sent in the course of nature (φύσει) for that purpose. Does he want this to take place among
mankind by a sudden appearance of God destroying evil in their hearts at a blow, and causing virtue to spring
up there? One might well inquire if it were fitting or possible that such a thing should happen. But we will suppose
that it is so. What then? How will our assent to the truth be (in that case) praiseworthy? You yourself profess to
recognize a special Providence: therefore you ought just as much to have told us, as we you, why it is that God,
knowing the affairs of men, does not correct them, and by a single stroke of His power rid Himself of the whole</note>

reasonableness of the gospel revelation. In the first place, then, as has been partially discussed
before1978, let us consider what is that which, by the rule of contraries, is opposed to virtue.
As darkness is the opposite of light, and death of life, so vice, and nothing else besides, is
plainly the opposite of virtue. For as in the many objects in creation there is nothing which
is distinguished by its opposition to light or life, but only the peculiar ideas which are their
exact opposites, as darkness and death—not stone, or wood, or water, or man, or anything
else in the world,—so, in the instance of virtue, it cannot be said that any created thing can
be conceived of as contrary to it, but only the idea of vice. If, then, our Faith preached that
the Deity had been begotten under vicious circumstances, an opportunity would have been
afforded the objector of running down our belief, as that of persons who propounded incongruous
and absurd opinions with regard to the Divine nature. For, indeed, it were blasphemous
to assert that the Deity, Which is very wisdom, goodness, incorruptibility, and every
other exalted thing in thought or word, had undergone change to the contrary. If, then, God
is real and essential virtue, and no mere existence1979 of any kind is logically opposed to
virtue, but only vice is so; and if the Divine birth was not into vice, but into human existence;
and if only vicious weakness is unseemly and shameful—and with such weakness neither
was God born, nor had it in His nature to be born,—why are they scandalized at the confession
that God came into touch with human nature, when in relation to virtue no contrariety
whatever is observable in the organization of man? For neither Reason, nor Understanding1980,
nor Receptivity for science, nor any other like quality proper to the essence of man,
is opposed to the principle of virtue.</p>

to men’s noblest emotions are amongst them. But whereas there had been already great differences
between the various ministers of the Word, the reformation of Jesus went beyond them all in greatness; for He

<p>“But,” it is said, “this change in our body by birth is a weakness, and one born under
such condition is born in weakness. Now the Deity is free from weakness. It is, therefore, a
strange idea in connection with God,” they say, “when people declare that one who is essentially
free from weakness thus comes into fellowship with weakness.” Now in reply to this
let us adopt the same argument as before, namely that the word “weakness” is used partly
in a proper, partly in an adapted sense. Whatever, that is, affects the will and perverts it from
virtue to vice is really and truly a weakness; but whatever in nature is to be seen proceeding
by a chain peculiar to itself of successive stages would be more fitly called a work than a
weakness. As, for instance, birth, growth, the continuance of the underlying substance
through the influx and efflux of the aliments, the meeting together of the component elements
of the body, and, on the other hand, the dissolution of its component parts and their passing
back into the kindred elements. Which “weakness,” then, does our Mystery assert that the
Deity came in contact with? That which is properly called weakness, which is vice, or that
which is the result of natural movements? Well, if our Faith affirmed that the Deity was
born under forbidden circumstances, then it would be our duty to shun a statement which
gave this profane and unsound description of the Divine Being. But if it asserts that God
laid hold on this nature of ours, the production of which in the first instance and the subsistence
afterwards had its origin in Him, in what way does this our preaching fail in the
reverence that befits Him? Amongst our notions of God no disposition tending to weakness
goes along with our belief in Him. We do not say that a physician is in weakness when he
is employed in healing one who is so1981. For though he touches the infirmity he is himself
unaffected by it. If birth is not regarded in itself as a weakness, no one can call life such. But
the feeling of sensual pleasure does go before the human birth, and as to the impulse to vice
in all living men, this is a disease of our nature. But then the Gospel mystery asserts that He
Who took our nature was pure from both these feelings. If, then, His birth had no connection
with sensual pleasure, and His life none with vice, what “weakness” is there left which the
mystery of our religion asserts that God participated in? But should any one call the separa-
<note type="footnote">1981 So Origen (c. Cels. iv. 15) illustrates the κένωσις and συγκατάβασις of Christ: “Nor was this change one
from the heights of excellence to the depths of baseness (τὸ πονηρότατον), for how can goodness and love be
baseness? If they were, it would be high time to declare that the surgeon who inspects or touches grievous and
unsightly cases in order to heal them undergoes such a change from good to bad.”</note>

tion of body and soul a weakness1982, far more justly might he term the meeting together
of these two elements such. For if the severance of things that have been connected is a
weakness, then is the union of things that are asunder a weakness also. For there is a feeling
of movement in the uniting of things sundered as well as in the separation of what has been
welded into one. The same term, then, by which the final movement is called, it is proper
to apply to the one that initiated it. If the first movement, which we call birth, is not a
weakness, it follows that neither the second, which we call death, and by which the severance
of the union of the soul and body is effected, is a weakness. Our position is, that God was
born subject to both movements of our nature; first, that by which the soul hastens to join
the body, and then again that by which the body is separated from the soul; and that when
the concrete humanity was formed by the mixture of these two, I mean the sentient and the
intelligent element, through that ineffable and inexpressible conjunction, this result in the
Incarnation followed, that after the soul and body had been once united the union continued
for ever. For when our nature, following its own proper course, had even in Him been advanced
to the separation of soul and body, He knitted together again the disunited elements,
cementing them, as it were, together with the cement of His Divine power, and recombining
what has been severed in a union never to be broken. And this is the Resurrection, namely
the return, after they have been dissolved, of those elements that had been before linked
together, into an indissoluble union through a mutual incorporation; in order that thus the
primal grace which invested humanity might be recalled, and we restored to the everlasting
life, when the vice that has been mixed up with our kind has evaporated through our dissolution,
as happens to any liquid when the vessel that contained it is broken, and it is spilt
and disappears, there being nothing to contain it. For as the principle of death took its rise
in one person and passed on in succession through the whole of human kind, in like manner
the principle of the Resurrection-life extends from one person to the whole of humanity.
For He Who reunited to His own proper body the soul that had been assumed by Himself,
by virtue of that power which had mingled with both of these component elements at their
first framing, then, upon a more general scale as it were1983, conjoined the intellectual to
<note type="footnote">1982 There is no one word in English which would represent the full meaning of πάθος. “Sufferance” sometimes
comes nearest to it, but not here, where Gregory is attempting to express that which in no way whatever attached
to the Saviour, i.e. moral weakness, as opposed to physical infirmity.</note>
<note type="footnote">1983 upon a more general scale as it were. The Greek here is somewhat obscure; the best reading is Krabinger’s;
γενικωτέρῳ τινι λόγῳ τὴν νοερὰν οὐσίαν τῇ αἰσθητῇ συγκατέμιξεν. Hervetus’ translation is manifestly wrong;
“Is generosiorem quandam intelligentem essentiam commiscuit sensili principio.”—Soul and body have been
reunited by the Resurrection, on a larger scale and to a wider extent (λόγῳ), than in the former instance of a
single Person (in the Incarnation), the new principle of life progressing to the extremities of humanity by natural
consequence: γενικωτέρῳ will thus refer by comparison to “the first framing of these component elements.” Or
else it contrasts the amount of life with that of death: and is to be explained by Rom. v. 15, “But not as the offence,</note>

<pb n="915"/>
the sentient nature, the new principle freely progressing to the extremities by natural consequence.
For when, in that concrete humanity which He had taken to Himself, the soul
after the dissolution returned to the body, then this uniting of the several portions passes,
as by a new principle, in equal force upon the whole human race. This, then, is the mystery
of God’s plan with regard to His death and His resurrection from the dead; namely, instead
of preventing the dissolution of His body by death and the necessary results of nature, to
bring both back to each other in the resurrection; so that He might become in Himself the
meeting-ground both of life and death, having re-established in Himself that nature which
death had divided, and being Himself the originating principle of the uniting those separated
portions.</p>
<note type="footnote">so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift
by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.” Krabinger’s translation, “generaliori
quâdam ratione,” therefore seems correct. The mode of the union of soul and body is described in Gregory’s
Treatise on the Soul as κρείττων λόγος, and in his Making of Man as ἄφραστος λόγος, but in neither is there
any comparison but with other less perfect modes of union; i.e. the reference is to quality, not to quantity, as

<p>But it will be said that the objection which has been brought against us has not yet been
solved, and that what unbelievers have urged has been rather strengthened by all we have
said. For if, as our argument has shown, there is such power in Him that both the destruction
of death and the introduction of life resides in Him, why does He not effect His purpose by
the mere exercise of His will, instead of working out our salvation in such a roundabout
way, by being born and nurtured as a man, and even, while he was saving man, tasting death;
when it was possible for Him to have saved man without subjecting Himself to such conditions?
Now to this, with all candid persons, it were sufficient to reply, that the sick do not
dictate to their physicians the measures for their recovery, nor cavil with those who do them
good as to the method of their healing; why, for instance, the medical man felt the diseased
part and devised this or that particular remedy for the removal of the complaint, when they
expected another; but the patient looks to the end and aim of the good work, and receives
the benefit with gratitude. Seeing, however, as says the Prophet1984, that God’s abounding
goodness keeps its utility concealed, and is not seen in complete clearness in this present
life—otherwise, if the eyes could behold all that is hoped for, every objection of unbelievers
would be removed,—but, as it is, abides the ages that are coming, when what is at present
seen only by the eye of faith must be revealed, it is needful accordingly that, as far as we
may, we should by the aid of arguments, the best within our reach, attempt to discover for
these difficulties also a solution in harmony with what has gone before.</p>

<p>And yet it is perhaps straining too far for those who do believe that God sojourned here
in life to object to the manner of His appearance1985, as wanting wisdom or conspicuous
reasonableness. For to those who are not vehemently antagonistic to the truth there exists
no slight proof of the Deity having sojourned here; I mean that which is exhibited now in
this present life before the life to come begins, the testimony which is borne by actual facts.
For who is there that does not know that every part of the world was overspread with demoniacal
delusion which mastered the life of man through the madness of idolatry; how
this was the customary rule among all nations, to worship demons under the form of idols,
with the sacrifice of living animals and the polluted offerings on their altars? But from the
time when, as says the Apostle, “the grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men appeared1986,”
and dwelt among us in His human nature, all these things passed away like
smoke into nothingness, the madness of their oracles and prophesyings ceased, the annual
pomps and pollutions of their bloody hecatombs came to an end, while among most nations
altars entirely disappeared, together with porches, precincts, and shrines, and all the ritual
besides which was followed out by the attendant priest of those demons, to the deception
both of themselves and of all who came in their way. So that in many of these places no
memorial exists of these things having ever been. But, instead, throughout the whole world
there have arisen in the name of Jesus temples and altars and a holy and unbloody Priesthood1987,
and a sublime philosophy, which teaches, by deed and example more than by
word, a disregard of this bodily life and a contempt of death, a contempt which they whom
tyrants have tried to force to apostatize from the faith have manifestly displayed, making
no account of the cruelties done to their bodies or of their doom of death: and yet, plainly,
it was not likely that they would have submitted to such treatment unless they had had a
clear and indisputable proof of that Divine Sojourn among men. And the following fact is,

Ps. xcv., citing Malachi), and the Priesthood which offers it can be called “unbloody” too. Cf. Greg. Naz. in Poem.

further, a sufficient mark, as against the Jews, of the presence among them1988 of Him in
Whom they disbelieve; up to the time of the manifestation of Christ the royal palaces in
Jerusalem were in all their splendour: there was their far-famed Temple; there was the customary
round of their sacrifices throughout the year: all the things, which had been expressed
by the Law in symbols to those who knew how to read its secrets, were up to that point of
time unbroken in their observance, in accordance with that form of worship which had
been established from the beginning. But when at length they saw Him Whom they were
looking for, and of Whom by their Prophets and the Law they had before been told, and
when they held in more estimation than faith in Him Who had so manifested Himself that
which for the future became but a degraded superstition, because they took it in a wrong
sense1989, and clung to the mere phrases of the Law in obedience to the dictates of custom
rather than of intelligence, and when they had thus refused the grace which had appeared,—
then even1990 those holy monuments of their religion were left standing, as they
do, in history alone; for no traces even of their Temple can be recognized, and their splendid
city has been left in ruins, so that there remains to the Jews nothing of the ancient institutions;
while by the command of those who rule over them the very ground of Jerusalem which
they so venerated is forbidden to them.</p>

that Jesus was something Divine and holy is this; that the Jews after what they did to Him have suffered so many
terrible afflictions for so long. And we shall be bold to say that they never will be restored again. They have
committed the most impious of crimes. They plotted against the Saviour of mankind in that city where the ceremonies
they continually performed for God enshrined great mysteries. It was right that that city where Jesus
suffered should be utterly destroyed, and the Jewish nation expelled, and that God’s call to blessedness should
be made to others, I mean the Christians, to whom have passed the doctrines of a religion of stainless purity,
and who have received new laws fitted for any form of government that exists” (c. Celsum, iv. 22). The Jews, he
says, will even “suffer more than others in the judgment which they anticipate, in addition to what they have
suffered already,” ii. 8. But he says, v. 43, “Would that they had not committed the error of having broken their
own law; first killing their prophets, and at last taking Jesus by stealth; for then we should still have amongst us
the model of that heavenly city which Plato attempted to sketch, though I cannot say that his powers came up

<p>Nevertheless, since neither those who take the Greek view, nor yet the leaders of Jewish
opinions, are willing to make such things the proofs of that Divine manifestation, it may be
as well, as regards these demurrers to our statement, to treat more particularly the reason
by virtue of which the Divine nature is combined with ours, saving, as it does, humanity by
means of itself, and not working out its proposed design by means of a mere command.

<p>It is, then, universally acknowledged that we must believe the Deity to be not only
almighty, but just, and good, and wise, and everything else that suggests excellence. It follows,
therefore, in the present dispensation of things, that it is not the case that some particular
one1992 of these Divine attributes freely displays itself in creation, while there is another
that is not present there; for, speaking once for all, no one of those exalted terms, when
disjoined from the rest, is by itself alone a virtue, nor is the good really good unless allied
with what is just, and wise, and mighty (for what is unjust, or unwise, or powerless, is not
good, neither is power, when disjoined from the principle of justice and of wisdom, to be
considered in the light of virtue; such species of power is brutal and tyrannous; and so, as
to the rest, if what is wise be carried beyond the limits of what is just, or if what is just be
not contemplated along with might and goodness, cases of that sort one would more properly
call vice; for how can what comes short of perfection be reckoned among things that are
good?). If, then, it is fitting that all excellences should be combined in the views we have of
God, let us see whether this Dispensation as regards man fails in any of those conceptions
which we should entertain of Him. The object of our inquiry in the case of God is before all
things the indications of His goodness. And what testimony to His goodness could there
be more palpable than this, viz. His regaining to Himself the allegiance of one who had revolted
to the opposite side, instead of allowing the fixed goodness of His nature to be affected
by the variableness of the human will? For, as David says, He had not come to save us had
not “goodness” created in Him such a purpose1993; and yet His goodness had not advanced
His purpose had not wisdom given efficacy to His love for man. For, as in the case of persons
who are in a sickly condition, there are probably many who wish that a man were not in
such evil plight, but it is only they in whom there is some technical ability operating in behalf
of the sick, who bring their good-will on their behalf to a practical issue, so it is absolutely
needful that wisdom should be conjoined with goodness. In what way, then, is wisdom
contemplated in combination with goodness; in the actual events, that is, which have taken
place? because one cannot observe a good purpose in the abstract; a purpose cannot possibly
be revealed unless it has the light of some events upon it. Well, the things accomplished,
progressing as they did in orderly series and sequence, reveal the wisdom and the skill of
<note type="footnote">1992 τὸ μέν τι (for τοι). There is the same variety of reading in c. i. and xxi., where Krabinger has preserved

the Divine economy. And since, as has been before remarked, wisdom, when combined
with justice, then absolutely becomes a virtue, but, if it be disjoined from it, cannot in itself
alone be good, it were well moreover in this discussion of the Dispensation in regard to
man, to consider attentively in the light of each other these two qualities; I mean, its wisdom
and its justice.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.</head>
<p>What, then, is justice? We distinctly remember what in the course of our argument we
said in the commencement of this treatise; namely, that man was fashioned in imitation of
the Divine nature, preserving his resemblance to the Deity as well in other excellences as in
possession of freedom of the will, yet being of necessity of a nature subject to change. For
it was not possible that a being who derived his origin from an alteration should be altogether
free from this liability. For the passing from a state of non-existence into that of existence
is a kind of alteration; when being, that is, by the exercise of Divine power takes the place
of nonentity. In the following special respect, too, alteration is necessarily observable in
man, namely, because man was an imitation of the Divine nature, and unless some distinctive
difference had been occasioned, the imitating subject would be entirely the same as that
which it resembles; but in this instance, it is to be observed, there is a difference between
that which “was made in the image” and its pattern; namely this, that the one is not subject
to change, while the other is (for, as has been described, it has come into existence through
an alteration), and being thus subject to alteration does not always continue in its existing
state. For alteration is a kind of movement ever advancing from the present state to another;
and there are two forms of this movement; the one being ever towards what is good, and in
this the advance has no check, because no goal of the course to be traversed1994 can be
reached, while the other is in the direction of the contrary, and of it this is the essence, that
it has no subsistence; for, as has been before stated, the contrary state to goodness conveys
some such notion of opposition, as when we say, for instance, that that which is is logically
opposed to that which is not, and that existence is so opposed to non-existence. Since, then,
by reason of this impulse and movement of changeful alteration it is not possible that the
nature of the subject of this change should remain self-centred and unmoved, but there is
always something towards which the will is tending, the appetency for moral beauty naturally
drawing it on to movement, this beauty is in one instance really such in its nature, in another
it is not so, only blossoming with an illusive appearance of beauty; and the criterion of these
two kinds is the mind that dwells within us. Under these circumstances it is a matter of risk
whether we happen to choose the real beauty, or whether we are diverted from its choice
by some deception arising from appearance, and thus drift away to the opposite; as happened,
we are told in the heathen fable, to the dog which looked askance at the reflection in the
water of what it carried in its mouth, but let go the real food, and, opening its mouth wide
to swallow the image of it, still hungered. Since, then, the mind has been disappointed in
its craving for the real good, and diverted to that which is not such, being persuaded, through
<note type="footnote">1994 of the course to be traversed: τοῦ διεξοδευομένου. Glauber remarks that the Latin translation here, “ejus
qui transit,” gives no sense, and rightly takes the word as a passive. Krabinger also translates, “ejus quod
evolvitur.” Here again there is unconscious Platonism: αὐτὸ τὸ καλόν is eternal.</note>

<pb n="923"/>
the deception of the great advocate and inventor of vice, that that was beauty which was
just the opposite (for this deception would never have succeeded, had not the glamour of
beauty been spread over the hook of vice like a bait),—the man, I say, on the one hand, who
had enslaved himself by indulgence to the enemy of his life, being of his own accord in this
unfortunate condition,—I ask you to investigate, on the other hand, those qualities which
suit and go along with our conception of the Deity, such as goodness, wisdom, power, immortality,
and all else that has the stamp of superiority. As good, then, the Deity entertains
pity for fallen man; as wise He is not ignorant of the means for his recovery; while a just
decision must also form part of that wisdom; for no one would ascribe that genuine justice
to the absence of wisdom.</p>

<p>What, then, under these circumstances is justice? It is the not exercising any arbitrary
sway over him who has us in his power1995, nor, by tearing us away by a violent exercise of
force from his hold, thus leaving some colour for a just complaint to him who enslaved man
through sensual pleasure. For as they who have bartered away their freedom for money are
the slaves of those who have purchased them (for they have constituted themselves their
own sellers, and it is not allowable either for themselves or any one else in their behalf to
call freedom to their aid, not even though those who have thus reduced themselves to this
sad state are of noble birth; and, if any one out of regard for the person who has so sold
himself should use violence against him who has bought him, he will clearly be acting un
justly in thus arbitrarily rescuing one who has been legally purchased as a slave, whereas, if
he wishes to pay a price to get such a one away, there is no law to prevent that), on the same
principle, now that we had voluntarily bartered away our freedom, it was requisite that no
arbitrary method of recovery, but the one consonant with justice1996 should be devised by
Him Who in His goodness had undertaken our rescue. Now this method is in a measure
this; to make over to the master of the slave whatever ransom he may agree to accept for
the person in his possession.</p>

the adverse power of the Rebel throng, as the secret Tradition says, “not by might, as if it was domineering, but,
according to the oracle secretly delivered to us, by right and justice” (quoted by Krabinger). To the words “not by
might,” S. Maximus has added the note, “This is what Gregory of Nyssa says in the Catechetic.” See next note.</note>

a party or defender in the case, is rather remarkable. The Prologue to the Book of Job furnishes a basis for it,
where Satan enters into terms with God. It appears to be the Miltonic view: as also that Envy was the first sin of
Satan.</note>

<p>What, then, was it likely that the master of the slave would choose to receive in his stead?
It is possible in the way of inference to make a guess as to his wishes in the matter, if, that
is, the manifest indications of what we are seeking for should come into our hands. He then,
who, as we before stated in the beginning of this treatise, shut his eyes to the good in his
envy of man in his happy condition, he who generated in himself the murky cloud of
wickedness, he who suffered from the disease of the love of rule, that primary and fundamental
cause of propension to the bad and the mother, so to speak, of all the wickedness
that follows,—what would he accept in exchange for the thing which he held, but something,
to be sure, higher and better, in the way of ransom, that thus, by receiving a gain in the exchange,
he might foster the more his own special passion of pride? Now unquestionably in
not one of those who had lived in history from the beginning of the world had he been
conscious of any such circumstance as he observed to surround Him Who then manifested
Himself, i.e. conception without carnal connection, birth without impurity, motherhood
with virginity, voices of the unseen testifying from above to a transcendent worth, the
healing of natural disease, without the use of means and of an extraordinary character,
proceeding from Him by the mere utterance of a word and exercise of His will, the restoration
of the dead to life, the absolution of the damned1997, the fear with which He inspired devils,
His power over tempests, His walking through the sea, not by the waters separating on either
side, and, as in the case of Moses’ miraculous power, making bare its depths for those who
passed through, but by the surface of the water presenting solid ground for His feet, and by
a firm and hard resistance supporting His steps; then, His disregard for food as long as it
pleased Him to abstain, His abundant banquets in the wilderness wherewith many thousands
were fully fed (though neither did the heavens pour down manna on them, nor was their
need supplied by the earth producing corn for them in its natural way, but that instance of
munificence1998 came out of the ineffable store-houses of His Divine power), the bread
ready in the hands of those who distributed it, as if they were actually reaping it, and becoming
more, the more the eaters were filled; and then, the banquet on the fish; not that the sea
supplied their need, but He Who had stocked the sea with its fish. But how is it possible to
narrate in succession each one of the Gospel miracles? The Enemy, therefore, beholding in
Him such power, saw also in Him an opportunity for an advance, in the exchange, upon
<note type="footnote">1997 the absolution of the damned. These words, wanting in all others, Krabinger has restored from the Codex
B. Morell translates “damnatorum absolutio.” The Greek is τὴν τῶν καταδίκων ἀνάU+0026 207·ῥυσιν. “Hæc Origenem
sapiunt, qui damnatorum poenis finem statuit:” Krabinger. But here at all events it is not necessary to accuse
Gregory of this, since he is clearly speaking only of Christ’s forgiveness of sins during His earthly ministry.</note>

the value of what he held. For this reason he chooses Him as a ransom1999 for those who
were shut up in the prison of death. But it was out of his power to look on the unclouded
aspect of God; he must see in Him some portion of that fleshly nature which through sin
he had so long held in bondage. Therefore it was that the Deity was invested with the flesh,
in order, that is, to secure that he, by looking upon something congenial and kindred to
himself, might have no fears in approaching that supereminent power; and might yet by
perceiving that power, showing as it did, yet only gradually, more and more splendour in
the miracles, deem what was seen an object of desire rather than of fear. Thus, you see how
goodness was conjoined with justice, and how wisdom was not divorced from them. For to
have devised that the Divine power should have been containable in the envelopment of a
body, to the end that the Dispensation in our behalf might not be thwarted through any
fear inspired by the Deity actually appearing, affords a demonstration of all these qualities
at once—goodness, wisdom, justice. His choosing to save man is a testimony of his goodness;
His making the redemption of the captive a matter of exchange exhibits His justice, while
the invention whereby He enabled the Enemy to apprehend that of which he was before
incapable, is a manifestation of supreme wisdom.</p>
<note type="footnote">1999 he chooses Him as a ransom. This peculiar teaching of Gregory of Nyssa, that it was to the Devil, not
God the Father, that the ransom, i.e. Christ’s blood, was paid, is shared by Origen, Ambrose, and Augustine.
The latter says, “Sanguine Christi diabolus non ditatus est, sed ligatus,” i.e. bound by compact. On the other
hand Gregory Naz. (tom. I. Orat. 42) and John Damascene (De Fid. Orthod. iii. c. 27) give the ransom to the
Father.</note>

<p>But possibly one who has given his attention to the course of the preceding remarks
may inquire: “wherein is the power of the Deity, wherein is the imperishableness of that
Divine power, to be traced in the processes you have described?” In order, therefore, to
make this also clear, let us take a survey of the sequel of the Gospel mystery, where that
Power conjoined with Love is more especially exhibited. In the first place, then, that the
omnipotence of the Divine nature should have had strength to descend to the humiliation
of humanity, furnishes a clearer proof of that omnipotence than even the greatness and supernatural
character of the miracles. For that something pre-eminently great should be
wrought out by Divine power is, in a manner, in accordance with, and consequent upon
the Divine nature; nor is it startling to hear it said that the whole of the created world, and
all that is understood to be beyond the range of visible things, subsists by the power of God,
His will giving it existence according to His good pleasure. But this His descent to the humility
of man is a kind of superabundant exercise of power, which thus finds no check even
in directions which contravene nature. It is the peculiar property of the essence of fire to
tend upwards; no one therefore, deems it wonderful in the case of flame to see that natural
operation. But should the flame be seen to stream downwards, like heavy bodies, such a fact
would be regarded as a miracle; namely, how fire still remains fire, and yet, by this change
of direction in its motion, passes out of its nature by being borne downward. In like manner,
it is not the vastness of the heavens, and the bright shining of its constellations, and the order
of the universe and the unbroken administration over all existence that so manifestly displays
the transcendent power of the Deity, as this condescension to the weakness of our nature;
the way, in fact, in which sublimity, existing in lowliness, is actually seen in lowliness, and
yet descends not from its height, and in which Deity, entwined as it is with the nature of
man, becomes this, and yet still is that. For since, as has been said before, it was not in the
nature of the opposing power to come in contact with the undiluted presence of God, and
to undergo His unclouded manifestation, therefore, in order to secure that the ransom in
our behalf might be easily accepted by him who required it, the Deity was hidden under the
veil of our nature, that so, as with ravenous fish2000, the hook of the Deity might be gulped
down along with the bait of flesh, and thus, life being introduced into the house of death,
and light shining in darkness, that which is diametrically opposed to light and life might
vanish; for it is not in the nature of darkness to remain when light is present, or of death to
<note type="footnote">2000 as with ravenous fish. The same simile is found in John of Damascus (De Fid. iii. 27), speaking of Death.
“Therefore Death will advance, and, gulping down the bait of the Body, be transfixed with the hook of the Divinity:
tasting that sinless and life-giving Body, he is undone, and disgorges all whom he has ever engulphed:
for as darkness vanishes at the letting in of light, so corruption is chased away by the onset of life, and while
there is life given to all else, there is corruption only for the Corrupter.”</note>

exist when life is active. Let us, then, by way of summary take up the train of the arguments
for the Gospel mystery, and thus complete our answer to those who question this Dispensation
of God, and show them on what ground it is that the Deity by a personal intervention
works out the salvation of man. It is certainly most necessary that in every point the conceptions
we entertain of the Deity should be such as befit the subject, and not that, while one
idea worthy of His sublimity should be retained, another equally belonging to that estimate
of Deity should be dismissed from it; on the contrary, every exalted notion, every devout
thought, must most surely enter into our belief in God, and each must be made dependent
on each in a necessary sequence. Well, then; it has been pointed out that His goodness,
wisdom, justice, power, incapability of decay, are all of them in evidence in the doctrine of
the Dispensation in which we are. His goodness is caught sight of in His election to save
lost man; His wisdom and justice have been displayed in the method of our salvation; His
power, in that, though born in the likeness and fashion of a man, on the lowly level of our
nature, and in accordance with that likeness raising the expectation that he could be overmastered
by death, he, after such a birth, nevertheless produced the effects peculiar and
natural to Him. Now it is the peculiar effect of light to make darkness vanish, and of life to
destroy death. Since, then, we have been led astray from the right path, and diverted from
that life which was ours at the beginning, and brought under the sway of death, what is there
improbable in the lesson we are taught by the Gospel mystery, if it be this; that cleansing
reaches those who are befouled with sin, and life the dead, and guidance the wanderers, in
order that defilement may be cleansed, error corrected, and what was dead restored to life?</p>

<p>That Deity should be born in our nature, ought not reasonably to present any strangeness
to the minds of those who do not take too narrow a view of things. For who, when he takes
a survey of the universe, is so simple as not to believe that there is Deity in everything,
penetrating it, embracing it, and seated in it? For all things depend on Him Who is2001, nor
can there be anything which has not its being in Him Who is. If, therefore, all things are in
Him, and He in all things, why are they scandalized at the plan of Revelation when it teaches
that God was born among men, that same God Whom we are convinced is even now not
outside mankind? For although this last form of God’s presence amongst us is not the same
as that former presence, still His existence amongst us equally both then and now is evidenced;
only now He Who holds together Nature in existence is transfused in us; while at
that other time He was transfused throughout our nature, in order that our nature might
by this transfusion of the Divine become itself divine, rescued as it was from death, and put
beyond the reach of the caprice of the antagonist. For His return from death becomes to
our mortal race the commencement of our return to the immortal life.</p>

<p>Still, in his examination of the amount of justice and wisdom discoverable in this Dispensation
a person is, perhaps, induced to entertain the thought that it was by means of a
certain amount of deceit that God carried out this scheme on our behalf. For that not by
pure Deity alone, but by Deity veiled in human nature, God, without the knowledge of His
enemy, got within the lines of him who had man in his power, is in some measure a fraud
and a surprise; seeing that it is the peculiar way with those who want to deceive to divert in
another direction the expectations of their intended victims, and then to effect something
quite different from what these latter expected. But he who has regard for truth will agree
that the essential qualities of justice and wisdom are before all things these; viz. of justice,
to give to every one according to his due; of wisdom, not to pervert justice, and yet at the
same time not to dissociate the benevolent aim of the love of mankind from the verdict of
justice, but skilfully to combine both these requisites together, in regard to justice2002 returning
the due recompense, in regard to kindness not swerving from the aim of that love of
man. Let us see, then, whether these two qualities are not to be observed in that which took
place. That repayment, adequate to the debt, by which the deceiver was in his turn deceived,
exhibits the justice of the dealing, while the object aimed at is a testimony to the goodness
of Him who effected it. It is, indeed, the property of justice to assign to every one those
particular results of which he has sunk already the foundations and the causes, just as the
earth returns its harvests according to the kinds of seeds thrown into it; while it is the
property of wisdom, in its very manner of giving equivalent returns, not to depart from the
kinder course. Two persons may both mix poison with food, one with the design of taking
life, the other with the design of saving that life; the one using it as a poison, the other only
as an antidote to poison; and in no way does the manner of the cure adopted spoil the aim
and purpose of the benefit intended; for although a mixture of poison with the food may
be effected by both of these persons alike, yet looking at their intention we are indignant
with the one and approve the other; so in this instance, by the reasonable rule of justice, he
who practised deception receives in return that very treatment, the seeds of which he had
himself sown of his own free will. He who first deceived man by the bait of sensual pleasure
is himself deceived by the presentment of the human form. But as regards the aim and
purpose of what took place, a change in the direction of the nobler is involved; for whereas
he, the enemy, effected his deception for the ruin of our nature, He Who is at once the just,
and good, and wise one, used His device, in which there was deception, for the salvation of
him who had perished, and thus not only conferred benefit on the lost one, but on him, too,

who had wrought our ruin. For from this approximation of death to life, of darkness to
light, of corruption to incorruption, there is effected an obliteration of what is worse, and
a passing away of it into nothing, while benefit is conferred on him who is freed from those
evils. For it is as when some worthless material has been mixed with gold, and the gold-refiners2003
burn up the foreign and refuse part in the consuming fire, and so restore the more
precious substance to its natural lustre: (not that the separation is effected without difficulty,
for it takes time for the fire by its melting force to cause the baser matter to disappear; but
for all that, this melting away of the actual thing that was embedded in it to the injury of its
beauty is a kind of healing of the gold.) In the same way when death, and corruption, and
darkness, and every other offshoot of evil had grown into the nature of the author of evil,
the approach of the Divine power, acting like fire2004, and making that unnatural accretion
to disappear, thus by purgation2005 of the evil becomes a blessing to that nature, though the
separation is agonizing. Therefore even the adversary himself will not be likely to dispute
that what took place was both just and salutary, that is, if he shall have attained to a perception
of the boon. For it is now as with those who for their cure are subjected to the knife and the
cautery; they are angry with the doctors, and wince with the pain of the incision; but if recovery
of health be the result of this treatment, and the pain of the cautery passes away, they
will feel grateful to those who have wrought this cure upon them. In like manner, when,
after long periods of time, the evil of our nature, which now is mixed up with it and has
grown with its growth, has been expelled, and when there has been a restoration of those
who are now lying in Sin to their primal state, a harmony of thanksgiving will arise from
all creation2006, as well from those who in the process of the purgation have suffered chastisement,
as from those who needed not any purgation at all. These and the like benefits the
great mystery of the Divine incarnation bestows. For in those points in which He was mingled
with humanity, passing as He did through all the accidents proper to human nature, such
as birth, rearing, growing up, and advancing even to the taste of death, He accomplished all

<p>It is, then, completely in keeping with this, that He Who was thus pouring Himself into
our nature should accept this commixture in all its accidents. For as they who wash clothes
do not pass over some of the dirt and cleanse the rest, but clear the whole cloth from all its
stains, from one end to the other, that the cloak by being uniformly brightened from washing
may be throughout equal to its own standard of cleanness, in like manner, since the life of
man was defiled by sin, in its beginning, end, and all its intermediate states, there needed
an abstergent force to penetrate the whole, and not to mend some one part by cleansing,
while it left another unattended to. For this reason it is that, seeing that our life has been
included between boundaries on either side, one, I mean, at its beginning, and the other at
its ending, at each boundary the force that is capable of correcting our nature is to be found,
attaching itself to the beginning, and extending to the end, and touching all between those
two points2007. Since, then, there is for all men only one way of entrance into this life of
ours, from whence was He Who was making His entrance amongst us to transport Himself
into our life? From heaven, perhaps some one will say, who rejects with contempt, as base
and degraded, this species of birth, i.e. the human. But there was no humanity in heaven:
and in that supramundane existence no disease of evil had been naturalized; but He Who
poured Himself into man adopted this commixture with a view to the benefit of it. Where,
then, evil was not and the human life was not lived, how is it that any one seeks there the
scene of this wrapping up of God in man, or, rather, not man, but some phantom resemblance
of man? In what could the recovery of our nature have consisted if, while this earthly creature
was diseased and needed this recovery, something else, amongst the heavenly beings, had
experienced the Divine sojourning? It is impossible for the sick man to be healed, unless
his suffering member receives the healing. If, therefore, while this sick part was on earth,
omnipotence had touched it not, but had regarded only its own dignity, this its pre-occupation
with matters with which we had nothing in common would have been of no benefit to
man. And with regard to the undignified in the case of Deity we can make no distinction;
that is, if it is allowable to conceive at all of anything beneath the dignity of Deity beside
evil. On the contrary, for one who forms such a narrow-minded view of the greatness of the
Deity as to make it consist in inability to admit of fellowship with the peculiarities of our
<note type="footnote">2007 “In order that the sacrifice might be representative, He took upon Him the whole of our human nature
and became flesh, conditioned though that fleshly nature was throughout by sin. It was not only in His death

of those with whom His human nature brought Him into close and manifold relations.”—Lux Mundi, p. 217

nature, the degradation is in no point lessened by the Deity being conformed to the fashion
of a heavenly rather than of an earthly body. For every created being is distant, by an equal
degree of inferiority, from that which is the Highest, Who is unapproachable by reason of
the sublimity of His Being: the whole universe is in value the same distance beneath Him.
For that which is absolutely inaccessible does not allow access to some one thing while it is
unapproachable by another, but it transcends all existences by an equal sublimity. Neither,
therefore, is the earth further removed from this dignity, nor the heavens closer to it, nor
do the things which have their existence within each of these elemental worlds differ at all
from each other in this respect, that some are allowed to be in contact with the inaccessible
Being, while others are forbidden the approach. Otherwise we must suppose that the power
which governs the Universe does not equally pervade the whole, but in some parts is in excess,
in others is deficient. Consequently, by this difference of less or more in quantity or quality,
the Deity will appear in the light of something composite and out of agreement with itself;
if, that is, we could suppose it, as viewed in its essence, to be far away from us, whilst it is a
close neighbour to some other creature, and from that proximity easily apprehended. But
on this subject of that exalted dignity true reason looks neither downward nor upward in
the way of comparison; for all things sink to a level beneath the power which presides over
the Universe: so that if it shall be thought by them that any earthly nature is unworthy of
this intimate connection with the Deity, neither can any other be found which has such
worthiness. But if all things equally fall short of this dignity, one thing there is that is not
beneath the dignity of God, and that is, to do good to him that needed it. If we confess, then,
that where the disease was, there the healing power attended, what is there in this belief
which is foreign to the proper conception of the Deity?</p>

<p>But they deride our state of nature, and din into our ears the manner of our being born,
supposing in this way to make the mystery ridiculous, as if it were unbecoming in God by
such an entrance into the world as this to connect Himself with the fellowship of the human
life. But we touched upon this point before, when we said that the only thing which is essentially
degraded is moral evil or whatever has an affinity with such evil; whereas the orderly
process of Nature, arranged as it has been by the Divine will and law, is beyond the reach
of any misrepresentation on the score of wickedness: otherwise this accusation would reach
up to the Author of Nature, if anything connected with Nature were to be found fault with
as degraded and unseemly. If, then, the Deity is separate only from evil, and if there is no
nature in evil, and if the mystery declares that God was born in man but not in evil; and if,
for man, there is but one way of entrance upon life, namely that by which the embryo passes
on to the stage of life, what other mode of entrance upon life would they prescribe for God?
these people, I mean, who, while they judge it right and proper that the nature which evil
had weakened should be visited by the Divine power, yet take offence at this special method
of the visitation, not remembering that the whole organization of the body is of equal value
throughout, and that nothing in it, of all the elements that contribute to the continuance of
the animal life, is liable to the charge of being worthless or wicked. For the whole arrangement
of the bodily organs and limbs has been constructed with one end in view, and that is, the
continuance in life of humanity; and while the other organs of the body conserve the present
actual vitality of men, each being apportioned to a different operation, and by their means
the faculties of sense and action are exercised, the generative organs on the contrary involve
a forecast of the future, introducing as they do, by themselves, their counteracting transmission
for our race. Looking, therefore, to their utility, to which of those parts which are
deemed more honourable are these inferior2008? Nay, than which must they not in all
reason be deemed more worthy of honour? For not by the eye, or ear, or tongue, or any
other sense, is the continuation of our race carried on. These, as has been remarked, pertain
to the enjoyment of the present. But by those other organs the immortality of humanity is
secured, so that death, though ever operating against us, thus in a certain measure becomes
powerless and ineffectual, since Nature, to baffle him, is ever as it were throwing herself
into the breach through those who come successively into being. What unseemliness, then,
is contained in our revelation of God mingled with the life of humanity through those very
means by which Nature carries on the combat against death?</p>

<p>But they change their ground and endeavour to vilify our faith in another way. They
ask, if what took place was not to the dishonour of God or unworthy of Him, why did He
delay the benefit so long? Why, since evil was in the beginning, did He not cut off its further
progress?—To this we have a concise answer; viz. that this delay in conferring the benefit
was owing to wisdom and a provident regard for that which would be a gain for our nature.
In diseases, for instance, of the body, when some corrupt humour spreads unseen beneath
the pores, before all the unhealthy secretion has been detected on the skin, they who treat
diseases by the rules of art do not use such medicines as would harden the flesh, but they
wait till all that lurks within comes out upon the surface, and then, with the disease unmasked,
apply their remedies. When once, then, the disease of evil had fixed itself in the nature of
mankind, He, the universal Healer, waited for the time when no form of wickedness was
left still hidden in that nature. For this reason it was that He did not produce his healing for
man’s disease immediately on Cain’s hatred and murder of his brother; for the wickedness
of those who were destroyed in the days of Noah had not yet burst into a flame, nor had
that terrible disease of Sodomite lawlessness been displayed, nor the Egyptians’ war against
God2009, nor the pride of Assyria, nor the Jews’ bloody persecution of God’s saints, nor
Herod’s cruel murder of the children, nor whatever else is recorded, or if unrecorded was
done in the generations that followed, the root of evil budding forth in divers manners in
the wilful purposes of man. When, then, wickedness had reached its utmost height, and
there was no form of wickedness which men had not dared to do, to the end that the healing
remedy might pervade the whole of the diseased system, He, accordingly, ministers to the
disease; not at its beginning, but when it had been completely developed.</p>

<p>If, however, any one thinks to refute our argument on this ground, that even after the
application of the remedial process the life of man is still in discord through its errors, let
us lead him to the truth by an example taken from familiar things. Take, for instance, the
case of a serpent; if it receives a deadly blow on the head, the hinder part of the coil is not
at once deadened along with it; but, while the head is dead, the tail part is still animated
with its own particular spirit, and is not deprived of its vital motion: in like manner we may
see Sin struck its deadly blow and yet in its remainders still vexing the life of man. But then
they give up finding fault with the account of Revelation on these points, and make another
charge against it; viz. that the Faith does not reach all mankind. “But why is it,” they ask,
“that all men do not obtain the grace, but that, while some adhere to the Word, the portion
who remain unbelieving is no small one; either because God was unwilling to bestow his
benefit ungrudgingly upon all, or because He was altogether unable to do so?” Now neither
of these alternatives can defy criticism. For it is unworthy of God, either that He should not
will what is good, or that He should be unable to do it. “If, therefore, the Faith is a good
thing, why,” they ask, “does not its grace come upon all men?” Now2010, if in our representation
of the Gospel mystery we had so stated the matter as that it was the Divine will that
the Faith should be so granted away amongst mankind that some men should be called,
while the rest had no share in the calling, occasion would be given for bringing such a charge
against this Revelation. But if the call came with equal meaning to all and makes no distinction
as to worth, age, or different national characteristics (for it was for this reason that at
the very first beginning of the proclamation of the Gospel they who ministered the Word
were, by Divine inspiration, all at once enabled to speak in the language of any nation, viz.
in order that no one might be destitute of a share in the blessings of evangelical instruction),
with what reasonableness can they still charge it upon God that the Word has not influenced
all mankind? For He Who holds the sovereignty of the universe, out of the excess of this
regard for man, permitted something to be under our own control, of which each of us alone
is master. Now this is the will, a thing that cannot be enslaved, and of self-determining
power, since it is seated in the liberty of thought and mind. Therefore such a charge might
more justly be transferred to those who have not attached themselves to the Faith, instead
of resting on Him Who has called them to believe. For even when Peter at the beginning
preached the Gospel in a crowded assembly of the Jews, and three thousand at once received
the Faith, though those who disbelieved were more in number than the believers, they did
<note type="footnote">2010 The following passage is anti-Calvinistic. Gregory here, as continually elsewhere, asserts the freedom
of the will; and is strongly supported by Justin Martyr, i. 43: “If it has been fixed by fate that one man shall be
good, and another bad, the one is not praiseworthy, the other not culpable. And again, if mankind has not power
by a free choice to flee the evil and to choose the good, it is not responsible for any results, however shocking.”</note>

not attach blame to the Apostle on the ground of their disbelief. It was, indeed, not in reason,
when the grace of the Gospel had been publicly set forth, for one who had absented himself

<p>Yet, even in their reply to this, or the like, they are not at a loss for a contentious rejoinder.
For they assert that God, if He had been so pleased, might have forcibly drawn those,
who were not inclined to yield, to accept the Gospel message. But where then would have
been their free will? Where their virtuous merit? Where their meed of praise from their
moral directors? It belongs only to inanimate or irrational creatures to be brought round
by the will of another to his purpose; whereas the reasoning and intelligent nature, if it lays
aside its freedom of action, loses at the same time the gracious gift of intellect. For upon
what is he to employ any faculty of thought, if his power of choosing anything according to
his inclination lies in the will of another? But then, if the will remains without the capacity
of action, virtue necessarily disappears, since it is shackled by the enforced quiescence of
the will. Then, if virtue does not exist, life loses its value, reason moves in accordance with
fatalism, the praise of moral guardians2011 is gone, sin may be indulged in without risk, and
the difference between the courses of life is obliterated. For who, henceforth, could with any
reason condemn profligacy, or praise sobriety? Since2012 every one would have this ready
answer, that nothing of all the things we are inclined to is in our own power, but that by
some superior and ruling influence the wills of men are brought round to the purpose of
one who has the mastery over them. The conclusion, then is that it is not the goodness of
God that is chargeable with the fact that the Faith is not engendered in all men, but rather
the disposition of those by whom the preaching of the Word is received.</p>

<p>What other objection is alleged by our adversaries? This; that (to take the preferable
view2013) it was altogether needless that that transcendent Being should submit to the experience
of death, but He might independently of this, through the superabundance of His
power, have wrought with ease His purpose; still, if for some ineffable reason or other it was
absolutely necessary that so it should be, at least He ought not to have been subjected to the
contumely of such an ignominious kind of death. What death, they ask, could be more ignominious
than that by crucifixion? What answer can we make to this? Why, that the death
is rendered necessary by the birth, and that He Who had determined once for all to share
the nature of man must pass through all the peculiar conditions of that nature. Seeing, then,
that the life of man is determined between two boundaries, had He, after having passed the
one, not touched the other that follows, His proposed design would have remained only
half fulfilled, from His not having touched that second condition of our nature. Perhaps,
however, one who exactly understands the mystery would be justified rather in saying that,
instead of the death occurring in consequence of the birth, the birth on the contrary was
accepted by Him for the sake of the death; for He Who lives for ever did not sink down into
the conditions of a bodily birth from any need to live, but to call us back from death to life.
Since, then, there was needed a lifting up from death for the whole of our nature, He stretches
forth a hand as it were to prostrate man, and stooping down to our dead corpse He came
so far within the grasp of death as to touch a state of deadness, and then in His own body
to bestow on our nature the principle of the resurrection, raising as He did by His power
along with Himself the whole man. For since from no other source than from the concrete
lump of our nature2014 had come that flesh, which was the receptacle of the Godhead and
in the resurrection was raised up together with that Godhead, therefore just in the same
way as, in the instance of this body of ours, the operation of one of the organs of sense is
felt at once by the whole system, as one with that member, so also the resurrection principle
of this Member, as though the whole of mankind was a single living being, passes through
the entire race, being imparted from the Member to the whole by virtue of the continuity
and oneness of the nature. What, then, is there beyond the bounds of probability in what
this Revelation teaches us; viz. that He Who stands upright stoops to one who has fallen, in
order to lift him up from his prostrate condition? And as to the Cross, whether it possesses
some other and deeper meaning, those who are skilled in mysticism may explain; but,
however that may be, the traditional teaching which has reached us is as follows. Since all

things in the Gospel, both deeds and words, have a sublime and heavenly meaning, and
there is nothing in it which is not such, that is, which does not exhibit a complete mingling
of the human with the Divine, where the utterance exerted and the deeds enacted are human
but the secret sense represents the Divine, it would follow that in this particular as well as
in the rest we must not regard only the one element and overlook the other; but in the fact
of this death we must contemplate the human feature, while in the manner of it we must be
anxious to find the Divine2015. For since it is the property of the Godhead to pervade all
things, and to extend itself through the length and breadth of the substance of existence in
every part—for nothing would continue to be if it remained not within the existent; and
that which is this existent properly and primarily is the Divine Being, Whose existence in
the world the continuance of all things that are forces us to believe in,—this is the very thing
we learn from the figure of the Cross; it is divided into four parts, so that there are the projections,
four in number, from the central point where the whole converges upon itself; because
He Who at the hour of His pre-arranged death was stretched upon it is He Who binds
together all things into Himself, and by Himself brings to one harmonious agreement the
diverse natures of actual existences. For in these existences there is the idea either of something
above, or of something below, or else the thought passes to the confines sideways. If,
therefore, you take into your consideration the system of things above the heavens or of
things below the earth, or of things at the boundaries of the universe on either side, everywhere
the presence of Deity anticipates your thought as the sole observable power that in
every part of existing things holds in a state of being all those things. Now whether we ought
to call this Existence Deity, or Mind, or Power, or Wisdom, or any other lofty term which
might be better able to express Him Who is above all, our argument has no quarrel with the
appellation or name or form of phrase used. Since, then, all creation looks to Him, and is
about and around Him, and through Him is coherent with itself, things above being through
Him conjoined to things below and things lateral to themselves, it was right that not by
hearing only we should be conducted to the full understanding of the Deity, but that sight
also should be our teacher in these sublime subjects for thought; and it is from sight that
the mighty Paul starts when he initiates2016 the people of Ephesus in the mysteries, and
<note type="footnote">2015 ἐν μὲν τῷ θανάτῳ καθορᾷν τὸ ἀνθρώπινον, ἐν δὲ τῷ τρόπῳ πολυπραγμονεῖν τὸ θειότερον. This is
Krabinger’s reading (for ἐν τῳ ἀθανάτῳ…ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ) on the authority of Theodoret’s quotation and
two Codd. for the first, and of all his Codd. for the second. Hervetus also seems to have read the same, “in morte
quidem quod est humanum intueri, in modo autem perscrutari quod est divinius.” Glauber, however, translates
the common text, “Man muss bei dem Unsterblichen zwar das Menschliche betrachten, aber bei dem Menschen
auch das Göttliche hervorsuchen:” notwithstanding that he hints his preference for another reading, σκοπῷ for
this last; cf. just above, “but the secret sense represents the Divine,” which would then be parallel to this last
sentence.</note>

imbues them through his instructions with the power of knowing what is that “depth and
height and breadth and length.” In fact he designates each projection of the Cross by its
proper appellation. The upper part he calls height, the lower depth, and the side extensions
breadth and length; and in another passage2017 he makes his thought still clearer to the
Philippians, to whom he says, “that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.” In that passage he includes in
one appellation the centre and projecting arms2018, calling “things in earth” all that is in
the middle between things in heaven and things under the earth. Such is the lesson we learn
in regard to the mystery of the Cross. And the subsequent events which the narrative contains
follow so appropriately that, as even unbelievers must admit, there is nothing in them adverse
to the proper conceptions of the Deity. That He did not abide in death, that the wounds
which His body had received from the iron of the nails and spear offered no impediment
to His rising again, that after His resurrection He showed Himself as He pleased to His
disciples, that when He wished to be present with them He was in their midst without being
seen, as needing no entrance through open doors, and that He strengthened the disciples
by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and that He promised to be amongst them, and that
no partition wall should intervene between them and Him, and that to the sight He ascended
to Heaven while to the mind He was everywhere; all these, and whatever like facts the history
of Him comprises, need no assistance from arguments to show that they are signs of deity
and of a sublime and supereminent power. With regard to them therefore I do not deem it
necessary to go into any detail, inasmuch as their description of itself shows the supernatural
character. But since the dispensation of the washing (whether we choose to call it baptism,
or illumination, or regeneration; for we make the name no subject of controversy) is a part
of our revealed doctrines, it may be as well to enter on a short discussion of this as well.</p>

<p>For when they have heard from us something to this effect—that when the mortal passes
into life it follows necessarily that, as that first birth leads only to the existence of mortality,
another birth should be discovered, a birth which neither begins nor ends with corruption,
but one which conducts the person begotten to an immortal existence, in order that, as what
is begotten of a mortal birth has necessarily a mortal subsistence, so from a birth which admits
not corruption that which is born may be superior to the corruption of death; when, I say,
they have heard this and the like from us, and are besides instructed as to the process,—
namely that it is prayer and the invocation of heavenly grace, and water, and faith,
by which the mystery of regeneration is accomplished,—they still remain incredulous and
have an eye only for the outward and visible, as if that which is operated corporeally2019
concurred not with the fulfilment of God’s promise. How, they ask, can prayer and the invocation
of Divine power over the water be the foundation of life in those who have been
thus initiated? In reply to them, unless they be of a very obstinate disposition, one single
consideration suffices to bring them to an acquiescence in our doctrine. For let us in our
turn ask them about that process of the carnal generation which every one can notice. How
does that something which is cast for the beginnings of the formation of a living being become
a Man? In that case, most certainly, there is no method whatever that can discover for us,
by any possible reasoning, even the probable truth. For what correlation is there between
the definition of man and the quality observable in that something? Man, when once he is
put together, is a reasoning and intellectual being, capable of thought and knowledge; but
that something is to be observed only in its quality of humidity, and the mind grasps nothing
in it beyond that which is seen by the sense of sight. The reply, therefore, which we might
expect to receive from those whom we questioned as to how it is credible that a man is
compounded from that humid element, is the very reply which we make when questioned
about the regeneration that takes place through the water. Now in that other case any one
so questioned has this reply ready at hand, that that element becomes a man by a Divine
power, wanting which, the element is motionless and inoperative. If, therefore, in that instance
the subordinate matter does not make the man, but the Divine power changes that
visible thing into a man’s nature, it would be utterly unfair for them, when in the one case
they testify to such power in God, in this other department to suppose that the Deity is too
weak to accomplish His will. What is there common, they ask, between water and life? What
is there common, we ask them in return, between humidity and God’s image? In that case

<pb n="944"/>
there is no paradox if, God so willing, what is humid changes into the most rare creature2020.
Equally, then, in this case we assert that there is nothing strange when the presence of a

<p>But they ask for proof of this presence of the Deity when invoked for the sanctification
of the baptismal process2021. Let the person who requires this evidence recall to mind the
result of our inquiries further back. The reasoning by which we established that the power
which was manifested to us through the flesh was really a Divine power, is the defence of
that which we now say. For when it has been shown that He Who was manifested in the
flesh, and then exhibited His nature by the miracles which He wrought, was God, it is also
at the same time shown that He is present in that process, as often as He is invoked. For, as
of everything that exists there is some peculiarity which indicates its nature, so truth is the
distinctive peculiarity of the Divine nature. Well, then, He has promised that He will always
be present with those that call upon Him, that He is in the midst of those that believe, that
He remains among them collectively and has special intercourse with each one. We can no
longer, then, need any other proof of the presence of the Deity in the things that are done
in Baptism, believing as we do that He is God by reason of the miracles which He wrought,
and knowing as we do that it is the peculiarity of the Godhead to be free from any touch of
falsehood, and confidently holding as we do that the thing promised was involved in the
truthfulness of its announcement. The invocation by prayer, then, which precedes this Divine
Dispensation constitutes an abundance of proof that what is effected is done by God. For
if in the case of that other kind of man-formation the impulses of the parents, even though
they do not invoke the Deity, yet by the power of God, as we have before said, mould the
embryo, and if this power is withheld their eagerness is ineffectual and useless, how much
more will the object be accomplished in that spiritual mode of generation, where both God
has promised that He will be present in the process and, as we have believed, has put power
from Himself into the work, and, besides, our own will is bent upon that object; supposing,
that is, that the aid which comes through prayer has at the same time been duly called in?
For as they who pray God that the sun may shine on them in no way blunt the promptitude
of that which is actually going to take place, yet no one will say that the zeal of those who
thus pray is useless on the ground that they pray God for what must happen, in the same
way they who, resting on the truthfulness of His promise, are firmly persuaded that His
grace is surely present in those who are regenerate in this mystical Dispensation, either
themselves make2022 an actual addition to that grace, or at all events do not cause the existing
grace to miscarry. For that the grace is there is a matter of faith, on account of Him Who
has promised to give it being Divine; while the testimony as to His Divinity comes through

<p>But the descent into the water, and the trine immersion of the person in it, involves
another mystery. For since the method of our salvation was made effectual not so much by
His precepts in the way of teaching2025 as by the deeds of Him Who has realized an actual
fellowship with man, and has effected life as a living fact, so that by means of the flesh which
He has assumed, and at the same time deified2026, everything kindred and related may be

de nous déifier” (Denis, Philosophie d’Origène, p. 458). This θεοποίησις or θέωσις is more than a metaphor even
from the first; “vere fideles vocantur θεοί, non naturâ quidem, sed τῇ ὁμοιώσει, ait Athanasius;” Casaubon, In
Epist. ad Eustath. “We become ‘gods’ by grasping the Divine power and substance;” Clement, Stromata, iv. That
the Platonists had thus used the word of τὸ πρὸς μείζονα δόξαν ἀνυψωθὲν is clear. Synesius in one of his Hymns
says to his soul:— “Soon commingled with the Father Thou shalt dance a ‘god’ with God.” Just as elsewhere (in
Dione, p. 50) he says, “it is not sufficient not to be bad; each must be even a ‘god.’” Cf. also Gregory Thaum.
Panegyr Origenis, §142. When we come to the Fathers of the 4th century and later, these words are used more
especially of the work of the Holy Spirit upon man. Cf. Cyrill. Alex.: “If to be able to ‘deify’ is a greater thing than
a creature can do, and if the Spirit does ‘deify,’ how can he be created or anything but God, seeing that he ‘deifies’?”
“If the Spirit is not God,” says Gregory Naz., “let him first be deified, and then let him deify me his equal;” where
two things are implied, 1. that the recognized work of the Holy Spirit is to ‘deify,’ 2. that this “deification” is not
Godhead. It is “the comparative god-making” of Dionysius Areopag. whereby we are “partakers of the Divine
nature” (2 Pet. i. 4). On the word as applied to the human nature of our Saviour Himself, Huet (Origeniana, ii.
3, c. 17), in discussing the statement of Origen, in his Commentary on S. Matthew (Tract 27), that “Christ after
His resurrection ‘deified’ the human nature which He had taken,” remarks, “If we take this word so as to make
Origen mean that the Word was changed into the human nature, and that the flesh itself was changed into God
and made of the same substance as the Word, he will clearly be guilty of that deadly error which Apollinaris
brought into the Church (i.e. that the Saviour’s soul is not ‘reasonable,’ nor His flesh human); or rather of the
heresy perpetrated by some sects of the Eutychians, who asserted that the human nature was changed into the
Divine after the Resurrection. But if we take him to mean that Christ’s human nature, after being divested of
weakness after death, assumed a certain Divine quality, we shall be doing Him no wrong.” He then quotes a line
from Gregory’s Iambics:— “The thing ‘deifying,’ and the thing ‘deified,’ are one God:” and this is said even of Christ’s
Incarnation; how much more then can it be said of His Resurrection state, as in this passage of the Great Catechism?
Huet adds one of Origen’s answers to Celsus: “His mortal body and the human soul in Him, by virtue of
their junction or rather union and blending with that (deity), assumed, we assert, qualities of the very greatest
kind.…What incredibility is there in the quality of mortality in the body of Jesus changing, when God so planned</note>

saved along with it, it was necessary that some means should be devised by which there
might be, in the baptismal process, a kind of affinity and likeness between him who follows
and Him Who leads the way. Needful, therefore, is it to see what features are to be observed
in the Author of our life, in order that the imitation on the part of those that follow may be
regulated, as the Apostle says, after the pattern of the Captain of our salvation2027. For, as
it is they who are actually drilled into measured and orderly movements in arms by skilled
drill-masters, who are advanced to dexterity in handling their weapons by what they see
with their eyes, whereas he who does not practise what is shown him remains devoid of
such dexterity, in the same way it is imperative on all those who have an equally earnest
desire for the Good as He has, to be followers by the path of an exact imitation of Him Who
leads the way to salvation, and to carry into action what He has shown them. It is, in fact,
impossible for persons to reach the same goal unless they travel by the same ways. For as
persons who are at a loss how to thread the turns of mazes, when they happen to fall in with
some one who has experience of them, get to the end of those various misleading turnings
in the chambers by following him behind, which they could not do, did they not follow him
their leader step by step, so too, I pray you mark, the labyrinth of this our life cannot be
threaded by the faculties of human nature unless a man pursues that same path as He did
Who, though once in it, yet got beyond the difficulties which hemmed Him in. I apply this
figure of a labyrinth to that prison of death, which is without an egress2028 and environs
the wretched race of mankind. What, then, have we beheld in the case of the Captain of our
salvation? A three days’ state of death and then life again. Now some sort of resemblance
in us to such things has to be planned. What, then, is the plan by which in us too a resemblance
to that which took place in Him is completed? Everything that is affected by death has
its proper and natural place, and that is the earth in which it is laid and hidden. Now earth
and water have much mutual affinity. Alone of the elements they have weight and gravitate
downwards; they mutually abide in each other; they are mutually confined. Seeing, then,
the death of the Author of our life subjected Him to burial in earth and was in accord with
our common nature, the imitation which we enact of that death is expressed in the neighbouring
element. And as He, that Man from above2029, having taken deadness on Himself,
after His being deposited in the earth, returned back to life the third day, so every one who
<note type="footnote">and willed it, into an ethereal and Divine” (i.e. the matter, as the receptacle of these qualities, remaining the
same)? It is in this sense that Chrysostom can say that “Christ came to us, and took upon Him our nature and
deified it;” and Augustine, “your humanity received the name of that deity” (contr. Arian.).</note>

is knitted to Him by virtue of his bodily form, looking forward to the same successful issue,
I mean this arriving at life by having, instead of earth, water poured on him2030, and so
submitting to that element, has represented for him in the three movements the three-daysdelayed
grace of the resurrection. Something like this has been said in what has gone before,
namely, that by the Divine providence death has been introduced as a dispensation into the
nature of man, so that, sin having flowed away at the dissolution of the union of soul and
body, man, through the resurrection, might be refashioned, sound, passionless, stainless,
and removed from any touch of evil. In the case however of the Author of our Salvation this
dispensation of death reached its fulfilment, having entirely accomplished its special purpose.
For in His death, not only were things that once were one put asunder, but also things that
had been disunited were again brought together; so that in this dissolution of things that
had naturally grown together, I mean, the soul and body, our nature might be purified, and
this return to union of these severed elements might secure freedom from the contamination
of any foreign admixture. But as regards those who follow this Leader, their nature does not
admit of an exact and entire imitation, but it receives now as much as it is capable of receiving,
while it reserves the remainder for the time that comes after. In what, then, does this imitation
consist? It consists in the effecting the suppression of that admixture of sin, in the figure of
mortification that is given by the water, not certainly a complete effacement, but a kind of
break in the continuity of the evil, two things concurring to this removal of sin—the penitence
of the transgressor and his imitation of the death. By these two things the man is in a
measure freed from his congenital tendency to evil; by his penitence he advances to a hatred
of and averseness from sin, and by his death he works out the suppression of the evil. But
had it been possible for him in his imitation to undergo a complete dying, the result would
be not imitation but identity; and the evil of our nature would so entirely vanish that, as the
Apostle says, “he would die unto sin once for all2031.” But since, as has been said, we only
so far imitate the transcendent Power as the poverty of our nature is capable of, by having
the water thrice poured on us and ascending again up from the water, we enact that saving
burial and resurrection which took place on the third day, with this thought in our mind,
that as we have power over the water both to be in it and arise out of it, so He too, Who has
the universe at His sovereign disposal, immersed Himself in death, as we in the water, to
return2032 to His own blessedness. If, therefore, one looks to that which is in reason, and
judges of the results according to the power inherent in either party, one will discover no
disproportion in these results, each in proportion to the measure of his natural power

working out the effects that are within his reach. For, as it is in the power of man, if he is so
disposed, to touch the water and yet be safe, with infinitely greater ease may death be handled
by the Divine Power so as to be in it and yet not to be changed by it injuriously. Observe,
then, that it is necessary for us to rehearse beforehand in the water the grace of the resurrection,
to the intent that we may understand that, as far as facility goes, it is the same thing
for us to be baptized with water and to rise again from death. But as in matters that concern
our life here, there are some which take precedence of others, as being those without which
the result could not be achieved, although if the beginning be compared with the end, the
beginning so contrasted will seem of no account (for what equality, for instance, is there
between the man and that which is laid as a foundation for the constitution of his animal
being? And yet if that had never been, neither would this be which we see), in like manner
that which happens in the great resurrection, essentially vaster though it be, has its beginnings
and its causes here; it is not, in fact, possible that that should take place, unless this had gone
before; I mean, that without the laver of regeneration it is impossible for the man to be in
the resurrection; but in saying this I do not regard the mere remoulding and refashioning
of our composite body; for towards this it is absolutely necessary that human nature should
advance, being constrained thereto by its own laws according to the dispensation of Him
Who has so ordained, whether it have received the grace of the laver, or whether it remains
without that initiation: but I am thinking of the restoration to a blessed and divine condition,
separated from all shame and sorrow. For not everything that is granted in the resurrection
a return to existence will return to the same kind of life. There is a wide interval between
those who have been purified, and those who still need purification. For those in whose lifetime
here the purification by the laver has preceded, there is a restoration to a kindred state.
Now, to the pure, freedom from passion is that kindred state, and that in this freedom from
passion blessedness consists, admits of no dispute. But as for those whose weaknesses have
become inveterate2033, and to whom no purgation of their defilement has been applied, no
mystic water, no invocation of the Divine power, no amendment by repentance, it is absolutely
necessary that they should come to be in something proper to their case,—just as the
furnace is the proper thing for gold alloyed with dross,—in order that, the vice which has
been mixed up in them being melted away after long succeeding ages, their nature may be
restored pure again to God. Since, then, there is a cleansing virtue in fire and water, they
who by the mystic water have washed away the defilement of their sin have no further need
of the other form of purification, while they who have not been admitted to that form of
purgation must needs be purified by fire.</p>

<p>For common sense as well as the teaching of Scripture shows that it is impossible for
one who has not thoroughly cleansed himself from all the stains arising from evil to be admitted
amongst the heavenly company. This is a thing which, though little in itself, is the
beginning and foundation of great blessings. I call it little on account of the facility of the
means of amendment. For what difficulty is there in this matter? viz. to believe that God is
everywhere, and that being in all things He is also present with those who call upon Him
for His life-supporting power, and that, thus present, He does that which properly belongs
to Him to do. Now, the work properly belonging to the Divine energy is the salvation of
those who need it; and this salvation proves effectual2034 by means of the cleansing in the
water; and he that has been so cleansed will participate in Purity; and true Purity is Deity.
You see, then, how small a thing it is in its beginning, and how easily effected; I mean, faith
and water; the first residing within the will, the latter being the nursery companion of the
life of man. But as to the blessing which springs from these two things, oh! how great and
how wonderful it is, that it should imply relationship with Deity itself!</p>

<p>But since the human being is a twofold creature, compounded of soul and body, it is
necessary that the saved should lay hold of2035 the Author of the new life through both their
component parts. Accordingly, the soul being fused into Him through faith derives from
that the means and occasion of salvation; for the act of union with the life implies a fellowship
with the life. But the body comes into fellowship and blending with the Author of our salvation
in another way. For as they who owing to some act of treachery have taken poison, allay
its deadly influence by means of some other drug (for it is necessary that the antidote should
enter the human vitals in the same way as the deadly poison, in order to secure, through
them, that the effect of the remedy may be distributed through the entire system), in like
manner we, who have tasted the solvent of our nature2036, necessarily need something that
may combine what has been so dissolved, so that such an antidote entering within us may,
by its own counter-influence, undo the mischief introduced into the body by the poison.
What, then, is this remedy to be? Nothing else than that very Body which has been shown
to be superior to death, and has been the First-fruits of our life. For, in the manner that, as
the Apostle says2037, a little leaven assimilates to itself the whole lump, so in like manner
that body to which immortality has been given it by God, when it is in ours, translates and
transmutes the whole into itself. For as by the admixture of a poisonous liquid with a
wholesome one the whole draught is deprived of its deadly effect, so too the immortal Body,
by being within that which receives it, changes the whole to its own nature. Yet in no other
way can anything enter within the body but by being transfused through the vitals by eating
and drinking. It is, therefore, incumbent on the body to admit this life-producing power in
the one way that its constitution makes possible. And since that Body only which was the
receptacle of the Deity received this grace of immortality, and since it has been shown that
in no other way was it possible for our body to become immortal, but by participating in
incorruption through its fellowship with that immortal Body, it will be necessary to consider
how it was possible that that one Body, being for ever portioned to so many myriads of the
faithful throughout the whole world, enters through that portion, whole into each individual,
and yet remains whole in itself. In order, therefore, that our faith, with eyes fixed on logical
probability, may harbour no doubt on the subject before us, it is fitting to make a slight digression
in our argument, to consider the physiology of the body. Who is there that does
not know that our bodily frame, taken by itself, possesses no life in its own proper subsistence,

but that it is by the influx of a force or power from without that it holds itself together and
continues in existence, and by a ceaseless motion that it draws to itself what it wants, and
repels what is superfluous? When a leathern bottle is full of some liquid, and then the contents
leak out at the bottom, it would not retain the contour of its full bulk unless there entered
in at the top something else to fill up the vacuum; and thus a person, seeing the circumference
of this bottle swollen to its full size, would know that this circumference did not really belong
to the object which he sees, but that what was being poured in, by being in it, gave shape
and roundness to the bulk. In the same way the mere framework of our body possesses
nothing belonging to itself that is cognizable by us, to hold it together, but remains in existence
owing to a force that is introduced into it. Now this power or force both is, and is called,
nourishment. But it is not the same in all bodies that require aliment, but to each of them
has been assigned a food adapted to its condition by Him who governs Nature. Some animals
feed on roots which they dig up. Of others grass is the food, of others different kinds of flesh,
but for man above all things bread; and, in order to continue and preserve the moisture of
his body, drink, not simply water, but water frequently sweetened with wine, to join forces
with our internal heat. He, therefore, who thinks of these things, thinks by implication2038
of the particular bulk of our body. For those things by being within me became my blood
and flesh, the corresponding nutriment by its power of adaptation being changed into the
form of my body. With these distinctions we must return to the consideration of the question
before us. The question was, how can that one Body of Christ vivify the whole of mankind,
all, that is, in whomsoever there is Faith, and yet, though divided amongst all, be itself not
diminished? Perhaps, then, we are now not far from the probable explanation. If the subsistence
of every body depends on nourishment, and this is eating and drinking, and in the case
of our eating there is bread and in the case of our drinking water sweetened with wine, and
if, as was explained at the beginning, the Word of God, Who is both God and the Word,
coalesced with man’s nature, and when He came in a body such as ours did not innovate
on man’s physical constitution so as to make it other than it was, but secured continuance
for His own body by the customary and proper means, and controlled its subsistence by
meat and drink, the former of which was bread,—just, then, as in the case of ourselves, as
has been repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a
human body, for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that other
case, the body into which God entered, by partaking of the nourishment of bread, was, in
a certain measure, the same with it; that nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into
the nature of the body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in the
case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by bread; which Body also by
the indwelling of God the Word was transmuted to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then,
<note type="footnote">2038 δυνάμει.</note>

<pb n="954"/>
do we believe that now also the bread which is consecrated by the Word of God is changed
into the Body of God the Word. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but has been
consecrated by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh. Therefore, from
the same cause as that by which the bread that was transformed in that Body was changed
to a Divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the grace of
the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the bread, and in a
manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle2039, “is sanctified
by the Word of God and prayer”; not that it advances by the process of eating2040 to the
stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once changed into the body by means
of the Word, as the Word itself said, “This is My Body.” Seeing, too, that all flesh is nourished
by what is moist (for without this combination our earthly part would not continue to live),
just as we support by food which is firm and solid the solid part of our body, in like manner
we supplement the moist part from the kindred element; and this, when within us, by its
faculty of being transmitted, is changed to blood, and especially if through the wine it receives
the faculty of being transmuted into heat. Since, then, that God-containing flesh partook
for its substance and support of this particular nourishment also, and since the God who

<note type="footnote">2040 by the process of eating, διὰ βρώσεως. There is very little authority for καὶ πόσεως which follows in some
Codd. If Krabinger’s text is here correct, Gregory distinctly teaches a transmutation of the elements very like
the later transubstantiation: he also distinctly teaches that the words of consecration effect the change. There
seems no reason to doubt that the text is correct. The three Latin interpretations, “a verbo transmutatus,” “statim
a verbo transmutatus,” “per verbum mutatus,” of Hervetus, Morell, and Zinus, all point to their having found
πρὸς τὸ σῶμα διὰ τοῦ λόγου μεταποιούμενος in the text: and this is the reading of Cod. Reg. (the other reading
is πρὸς τὸ σῶμα τοῦ λόγου). A passage from Justin Mart., Apol. ii. p. 77, also supports Krabinger’s text. Justin
says, “so we are taught that that food which has been blessed by the pronouncing of the word that came from
Him, which food by changing nourishes our blood and flesh, is the flesh and blood of that Incarnate Jesus.” As
to the nature of the change (πρὸς τὸ σῶμα μεταποιούμενος), another passage in Gregory (In Baptism. Christi,
370 A) should be compared: “The bread again, was for a while common bread, but when the mystic word shall
have consecrated it (ἱερουργήσῃ), it is called, and moreover is, the body of Christ.” He says also at the end of
this chapter, “He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He transelements (μεταστοιχειώσας)
the natural quality (φύσιν) of these visible things to that immortal thing.” Harnack does not attempt to weaken
the force of these and other passages, but only points out that the idea of this change does not exactly correspond
(how could it?) with the mediæval scholastically-philosophical “transubstantiation.” Gregory’s belief is that, just
as the Word, when Christ was here in the flesh, rendered holy His body that assimilated bread, which still in a
manner remained bread, so now the bread is sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer. “The idea,” says
Neander, “of the repetition of the consecration of the Λόγος had taken hold of his mind.” The construction is

was manifested infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by this
communion with Deity mankind might at the same time be deified, for this end it is that,
by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates Himself in every believer through that flesh,
whose substance comes from bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of believers,
to secure that, by this union with the immortal, man, too, may be a sharer in incorruption.
He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He transelements2041 the
natural quality of these visible things to that immortal thing.</p>
<note type="footnote">2041 μεταστοιχειώσας. Suicer labours, without success, to show that the word is not equivalent to transelementare
or μετουσιοῦν, but only to substantiam convertere, i.e. to change by an addition of grace into another
mode or use. In the passages from Epiphanius which Suicer adduces for “figure,” “mode,” as a meaning of
στοιχεῖον itself, that word means a sign of the zodiac (as in our Gregory’s De Animâ et Resurr., it means the
moon), only because the heavenly bodies are the elements or first principles as it were of the celestial alphabet.
The other meaning of μεταστοιχειοῦν which he gives, i.e. to unteach, with a view to obscure the literal meaning
here, is quite inapplicable. Gregory defines more clearly than Chrysostom (μεταρρυθμίζεσθαι), Theophylact
(μεταποιεῖσθαι), and John Damascene (μεταβάλλεσθαι), the change that takes place: but all go beyond Theodoret’s
(Dial. ii), “not changing nature, but adding grace to the nature,” which Suicer endeavours to read into this word
of Gregory’s. It is to be noticed, too, that in Philo the word is used of Xerxes changing in his march one element
into another, i.e. earth into water, not the mere use of the one into the use of the other.</note>

<p>There is now, I think, wanting in these remarks no answer to inquiries concerning the
Gospel mystery, except that on Faith2042; which we give briefly in the present treatise. For
those who require a more elaborate account we have already published it in other works of
ours, in which we have explained the subject with all the earnestness and accuracy in our
power. In those treatises we have both fought2043 controversially with our opponents, and
also have taken private consultation with ourselves as to the questions which have been
brought against us. But in the present discussion we have thought it as well only to say just
so much on the subject of faith as is involved in the language of the Gospel, namely, that
one who is begotten by the spiritual regeneration may know who it is that begets him, and
what sort of creature he becomes. For it is only this form of generation which has in it the
power to become what it chooses to be.</p>

<p>For, while all things else that are born are subject to the impulse of those that beget
them, the spiritual birth is dependent on the power of him who is being born. Seeing, then,
that here lies the hazard, namely, that he should not miss what is for his advantage, when
to every one a free choice is thus open, it were well, I think, for him who is moved towards
the begetting of himself, to determine by previous reasoning what kind of father is for his
advantage, and of what element it is better for him that his nature should consist. For, as
we have said, it is in the power of such a child as this to choose its parents. Since, then, there
is a twofold division of existences, into created and uncreated, and since the uncreated world
possesses within itself immutability and immobility, while the created is liable to change
and alteration, of which will he, who with calculation and deliberation is to choose what is
for his benefit, prefer to be the offspring; of that which is always found in a state of change,
or of that which possesses a nature that is changeless, steadfast, and ever consistent and
unvarying in goodness? Now there have been delivered to us in the Gospel three Persons
and names through whom the generation or birth of believers takes place, and he who is
begotten by this Trinity is equally begotten of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost—for thus does the Gospel speak of the Spirit, that “that which is born of Spirit is
spirit2044,” and it is “in Christ2045” that Paul begets, and the Father is the “Father of all;”
here, then, I beg, let the mind of the hearer be sober in its choice, lest it make itself the offspring
of some inconstant nature, when it has it in its power to make the steadfast and unalterable
nature the founder of its life. For according to the disposition of heart in one who
comes to the Dispensation will that which is begotten in him exhibit its power; so that he
who confesses that the Holy Trinity is uncreate enters on the steadfast unalterable life; while
another, who through a mistaken conception sees only a created nature in the Trinity and
then is baptized in that, has again been born into the shifting and alterable life. For that
which is born is of necessity of one kindred with that which begets. Which, then, offers the
greater advantage; to enter on the unchangeable life, or to be again tossed about by the waves
of this lifetime of uncertainty and change? Well, since it is evident to any one of the least
understanding that what is stable is far more valuable than what is unstable, what is perfect
than what is deficient, what needs not than what needs, and what has no further to advance,
but ever abides in the perfection of all that is good, than what climbs by progressive toil, it
is incumbent upon every one, at least upon every one who is possessed of sense, to make an
absolute choice of one or other of these two conditions, either to believe that the Holy
Trinity belongs to the uncreated world, and so through the spiritual birth to make It the
foundation of his own life, or, if he thinks that the Son or the Holy Ghost is external to the

being of the first, the true, the good, God, I mean, of the Father, not to include these Persons
in the belief which he takes upon him at the moment of his new birth, lest he unconsciously
make himself over to that imperfect nature2046 which itself needs some one to make it good,
and in a manner bring himself back again to something of the same nature as his own by
thus removing his faith2047 from that higher world. For whoever has bound himself to any
created thing forgets that, as from the Deity, he has no longer hope of salvation. For all
creation, owing to the whole equally proceeding from non-existence into being, has an intimate
connection with itself; and as in the bodily organization all the limbs have a natural
and mutual coherence, though some have a downward, some an upward direction, so the
world of created things is, viewed as the creation, in oneness with itself, and the differences
in us, as regards abundance or deficiency, in no wise disjoint it from this natural coherence
with itself. For in things which equally imply the idea of a previous non-existence, though
there be a difference between them in other respects, as regards this point we discover no
variation of nature. If, then, man, who is himself a created being, thinks that the Spirit and
the Only-begotten God2048 are likewise created, the hope which he entertains of a change
to a better state will be a vain one; for he only returns to himself2049. What happens then is
on a par with the surmises of Nicodemus; he, when instructed by our Lord as to the necessity
of being born from above, because he could not yet comprehend the meaning of the mystery,
had his thoughts drawn back to his mother’s womb2050. So that if a man does not conduct
himself towards the uncreated nature, but to that which is kindred to, and equally in bondage
with, himself, he is of the birth which is from below, and not of that which is from above.
But the Gospel tells us that the birth of the saved is from above.</p>

<p>But, as far as what has been already said, the instruction of this Catechism does not
seem to me to be yet complete. For we ought, in my opinion, to take into consideration the
sequel of this matter; which many of those who come to the grace of baptism2051 overlook,
being led astray, and self-deceived, and indeed only seemingly, and not really, regenerate.
For that change in our life which takes place through regeneration will not be change, if we
continue in the state in which we were. I do not see how it is possible to deem one who is
still in the same condition, and in whom there has been no change in the distinguishing
features of his nature, to be any other than he was, it being palpable to every one that it is
for a renovation and change of our nature that the saving birth is received. And yet human
nature does not of itself admit of any change in baptism; neither the reason, nor the understanding,
nor the scientific faculty, nor any other peculiar characteristic of man is a subject
for change. Indeed the change would be for the worse if any one of these properties of our
nature were exchanged away2052 for something else. If, then, the birth from above is a definite
refashioning of the man, and yet these properties do not admit of change, it is a subject
for inquiry what that is in him, by the changing of which the grace of regeneration is perfected.
It is evident that when those evil features which mark our nature have been obliterated
a change to a better state takes place. If, then, by being “washed,” as says the Prophet2053,
in that mystic bath we become “clean” in our wills and “put away the evil” of our souls, we
thus become better men, and are changed to a better state. But if, when the bath has been
applied to the body, the soul has not cleansed itself from the stains of its passions and affections,
but the life after initiation keeps on a level with the uninitiate life, then, though it may
be a bold thing to say, yet I will say it and will not shrink; in these cases the water is but
water, for the gift of the Holy Ghost in no ways appears in him who is thus baptismally born;
whenever, that is, not only the deformity of anger2054, or the passion of greed, or the unbridled
and unseemly thought, with pride, envy, and arrogance, disfigures the Divine image,
but the gains, too, of injustice abide with him, and the woman he has procured by adultery
still even after that ministers to his pleasures. If these and the like vices, after, as before,
surround the life of the baptized, I cannot see in what respects he has been changed; for I

observe him the same man as he was before. The man whom he has unjustly treated, the

laver of baptism. They do not hear the cry of Zacchæus from him as well: “If I have taken
any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold2055.” What they said of him
before his baptism, the same they now more fully declare; they call him by the same names,
a covetous person, one who is greedy of what belongs to others, one who lives in luxury at
the cost of men’s calamities. Let such an one, therefore, who remains in the same moral
condition as before, and then babbles to himself of the beneficial change he has received
from baptism, listen to what Paul says: “If a man think himself to be something, when he is
nothing, he deceiveth himself2056.” For what you have not become, that you are not. “As
many as received Him,” thus speaks the Gospel of those who have been born again, “to them
gave He power to become the sons of God2057.” Now the child born of any one is entirely
of a kindred nature with his parent. If, then, you have received God, if you have become a
child of God, make manifest in your disposition the God that is in you, manifest in yourself
Him that begot you. By the same marks whereby we recognize God, must this relationship
to God of the son so born be exhibited. “He openeth His hand and filleth every living thing
with His good pleasure.” “He passeth over transgressions.” “He repenteth Him of the evil.”
“The Lord is good to all, and bringeth not on us His anger every day.” “God is a righteous
Lord, and there is no injustice in Him2058;” and all other sayings of the like kind which are
scattered for our instruction throughout the Scripture;—if you live amidst such things as
these, you are a child of God indeed; but if you continue with the characteristic marks of
vice in you, it is in vain that you babble to yourself of your birth from above. Prophecy will
speak against you and say, “You are a ‘son of man,’ not a son of the Most High. You ‘love
vanity, and seek after leasing.’ Know you not in what way man is ‘made admirable2059’? In
no other way than by becoming holy.”</p>
<p>It will be necessary to add to what has been said this remaining statement also; viz. that
those good things which are held out in the Gospels to those who have led a godly life, are

not such as can be precisely described. For how is that possible with things which “eye hath
not seen, neither ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man2060”? Indeed, the
sinner’s life of torment presents no equivalent to anything that pains the sense here. Even
if some one of the punishments in that other world be named in terms that are well known
here, the distinction is still not small. When you hear the word fire, you have been taught
to think of a fire other than the fire we see, owing to something being added to that fire
which in this there is not; for that fire is never quenched, whereas experience has discovered
many ways of quenching this; and there is a great difference between a fire which can be
extinguished, and one that does not admit of extinction. That fire, therefore, is something
other than this. If, again, a person hears the word “worm,” let not his thoughts, from the
similarity of the term, be carried to the creature here that crawls upon the ground; for the
addition that it “dieth not” suggests the thought of another reptile than that known here.
Since, then, these things are set before us as to be expected in the life that follows this, being
the natural outgrowth according to the righteous judgment of God, in the life of each, of
his particular disposition, it must be the part of the wise not to regard the present, but that
which follows after, and to lay down the foundations for that unspeakable blessedness during
this short and fleeting life, and by a good choice to wean themselves from all experience of
evil, now in their lifetime here, hereafter in their eternal recompense2061.</p>

<head>Funeral Oration on Meletius2062.</head>
<p>The number of the Apostles has been enlarged for us by this our late Apostle being
reckoned among their company. These Holy ones have drawn to themselves one of like
conversation; those athletes a fellow athlete; those crowned ones another crowned like them;
the pure in heart one chaste in soul: those ministers of the Word another herald of that
Word. Most blessed, indeed, is our Father for this his joining the Apostolic band and his
departure to Christ. Most pitiable we! for the unseasonableness of our orphaned condition
does not permit us to congratulate ourselves on our Father’s happy lot. For him, indeed,
better it was by his departure hence to be with Christ, but it was a grievous thing for us to
be severed from his fatherly guidance. Behold, it is a time of need for counsel; and our
counsellor is silent. War, the war of heresy, encompasses us, and our Leader is no more.
The general body of the Church labours under disease, and we find not the physician. See
in what a strait we are. Oh! that it were possible I could nerve my weakness, and rising to
the full proportions of our loss, burst out with a voice of lamentation adequate to the
greatness of the distress, as these excellent preachers of yours have done, who have bewailed
with loud voice the misfortune that has befallen them in this loss of their father. But what
can I do? How can I force my tongue to the service of the theme, thus heavily weighted, and
shackled, as it were, by this calamity? How shall I open my mouth thus subdued to speech-
<note type="footnote">2062 Meletius, Bishop of Antioch, died at Constantinople, whither he had gone to attend the second OEcumenical
Council, a.d. 381. Of the “translation” of the remains to his own metropolis, described in this oration,
Sozomen (vii. 10) says, “The remains of Meletius were at the same time conveyed to Antioch; and deposited
near the tomb of Babylas the Martyr. It is said that by the command of the Emperor, the relics were received
with honour in every city through which they had to be conveyed, and that psalms were sung on the occasion,
a practice that was quite contrary to the usual Roman customs. After the pompous interment of Meletius,
Flavian was ordained in his stead.…This gave rise to fresh troubles.” The rationale of the rising relic-worship,
at all events of the sanctity of tombs, is thus given by Origen: “A feeling such as this (of bodies differing, as tenanted
by different souls) has prompted some to go so far as to treat as Divine the remains of uncommon men;
they feel that great souls have been there, while they would cast forth the bodies of the morally worthless without
the honour of a funeral (ἀτιμάσαι). This perhaps is not the right thing to do: still it proceeds from a right instinct
(ἐννοίας ὑγιοῦς). For it is not to be expected of a thinking man that he would take the same pains over the
burial of an Anytus, as he would over a Socrates, and that he would place the same barrow or the same sepulchre
over each” (c. Cels. iv. 59). Again, “The dwelling-place of the reasoning soul is not to be flung irreverently aside,
like that of the irrational soul; and more than this, we Christians believe that the reverence paid to a body that
has been tenanted by a reasoning soul passes to him also who has received a soul which by means of such an
instrument has fought a good fight,” viii. 30.</note>

lessness? How shall I give free utterance to a voice now habitually sinking to the pathetic
tone of lamentations? How can I lift up the eyes of my soul, veiled as I am with this darkness
of misfortune? Who will pierce for me this deep dark cloud of grief, and light up again, as
out of a clear sky, the bright ray of peace? From what quarter will that ray shine forth, now
that our star has set? Oh! evil moonless night that gives no hope of any star! With what an
opposite meaning, as compared with those of late, are our words uttered in this place now!
Then we rejoiced with the song of marriage, now we give way to piteous lamentation for
the sorrow that has befallen us! Then we chanted an epithalamium, but now a funeral dirge!
You remember the day when we entertained you at the feast of that spiritual marriage, and
brought home the virgin bride to the house of her noble bridegroom; when to the best of
our ability we proffered the wedding gifts of our praises, both giving and receiving joy in
turn2063. But now our delight has been changed to lamentation, and our festal garb become
sackcloth. It were better, maybe, to suppress our woe, and to hide our grief in silent seclusion,
so as not to disturb the children of the bride-chamber, divested as we are of the bright
marriage garment, and clothed instead with the black robe of the preacher. For since that
noble bridegroom has been taken from us, sorrow has all at once clothed us in the garb of
black; nor is it possible for us to indulge in the usual cheerfulness of our conversation, since
Envy2064 has stripped us of our proper and becoming dress. Rich in blessings we came to
you; now we leave you bare and poor. The lamp we held right above our head, shining with
the rich fulness of light, we now carry away quenched, its bright flame all dissolved into
smoke and dust. We held our great treasure in an earthen vessel. Vanished is the treasure,
and the earthen vessel, emptied of its wealth, is restored to them who gave it2065. What shall
we say who have consigned it? What answer will they make by whom it is demanded back?
Oh! miserable shipwreck! How, even with the harbour around us, have we gone to pieces
with our hopes! How has the vessel, fraught with a thousand bales of goods, sunk with all
its cargo, and left us destitute who were once so rich! Where is that bright sail which was

we sailed unhurt over the swelling waves of heresy? Where that immovable anchor of intelligence
which held us in absolute security and repose after our toils? Where that excellent
pilot2066 who steered our bark to its heavenly goal? Is, then, what has happened of small
moment, and is my passionate grief unreasoning? Is it not rather that I reach not the full
extent of our loss, though I exceed in the loudness of my expression of grief? Lend me, oh
lend me, my brethren, the tear of sympathy. When you were glad we shared your gladness.
Repay us, therefore, this sad recompense. “Rejoice with them that do rejoice2067.” This we
have done. It is for you to return it by “weeping with them that weep.” It happened once
that a strange people bewailed the loss of the patriarch Jacob, and made the misfortune of
another people their own, when his united family transported their father out of Egypt, and
lamented in another land the loss that had befallen them. They all prolonged their mourning
over him for thirty days and as many nights2068. Ye, therefore, that are brethren, and of the
same kindred, do as they who were of another kindred did. On that occasion the tear of
strangers was shed in common with that of countrymen; be it shed in common now, for
common is the grief. Behold these your patriarchs. All these are children of our Jacob. All
these are children of the free-woman2069. No one is base born, no one supposititious. Nor
indeed would it have become that Saint to introduce into the nobility of the family of Faith
a bond-woman’s kindred. Therefore is he our father because he was the father of our father2070.
Ye have just heard what and how great things an Ephraim and a Manasses2071 related
of their father, and how the wonders of the story surpassed description. Give me also leave
to speak on them. For this beatification of him from henceforth incurs no risk. Neither fear
I Envy; for what worse evil can it do me? Know, then, what the man was; one of the nobility
of the East, blameless, just, genuine, devout, innocent of any evil deed. Indeed the great Job
will not be jealous if he who imitated him be decked with the like testimonials of praise. But
Envy, that has an eye for all things fair, cast a bitter glance upon our blessedness; and one
who stalks up and down the world also stalked in our midst, and broadly stamped the footmark
of affliction on our happy state. It is not herds of oxen or sheep2072 that he has mal-

treated, unless in a mystical sense one transfers the idea of a flock to the Church. It is not
in these that we have received injury from Envy; it is not in asses or camels that he has
wrought us loss, neither has he excruciated our bodily feelings by a wound in the flesh; no,
but he has robbed us of our very head. And with that head have gone away from us the
precious organs of our senses. That eye which beheld the things of heaven is no longer ours,
nor that ear which listened to the Divine voice, nor that tongue with its pure devotion to
truth2073. Where is that sweet serenity of his eyes? Where that bright smile upon his lips?
Where that courteous right hand with fingers outstretched to accompany the benediction
of the mouth. I feel an impulse, as if I were on the stage, to shout aloud for our calamity.
Oh! Church, I pity you. To you, the city of Antioch, I address my words. I pity you for this
sudden reversal. How has your beauty been despoiled! How have you been robbed of your
ornaments! How suddenly has the flower faded! “Verily the grass withereth and the flower
thereof falleth away2074.” What evil eye, what witchery of drunken malice has intruded on
that distant Church? What is there to compensate her loss? The fountain has failed. The
stream has dried up. Again has water been turned into blood2075. Oh! the sad tidings which
tell the Church of her calamity! Who shall say to the children that they have no more a
father? Who shall tell the Bride she is a widow? Alas for their woes! What did they send out?
What do they receive back? They sent forth an ark, they receive back a coffin. The ark, my
brethren, was that man of God; an ark containing in itself the Divine and mystic things.
There was the golden vessel full of Divine manna, that celestial food2076. In it were the Tables
of the Covenant written on the tablets of the heart, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living
God2077. For on that pure heart no gloomy or inky thought was imprinted. In it, too, were
the pillars, the steps, the chapters, the lamps, the mercy-seat, the baths, the veils of the entrances.
In it was the rod of the priesthood, which budded in the hands of our Saint; and
whatever else we have heard the Ark contained2078 was all held in the soul of that man. But
in their stead what is there now? Let description cease. Cloths of pure white linen scarves

Priest when, without stint, she poured the alabaster box of ointment on his head. But the
treasure preserved within, what is it? Bones, now dead, and which even before dissolution
had rehearsed their dying, the sad memorials of our affliction. Oh! what a cry like that of
old will be heard in Rama, Rachel weeping2081, not for her children but for a husband, and
admitting not of consolation. Let alone, ye that would console; let alone; force not on us
your consolation2082. Let the widow indulge the deepness of her grief. Let her feel the loss
that has been inflicted on her. Yet she is not without previous practice in separation. In
those contests in which our athlete was engaged she had before been trained to bear to be
left. Certainly you must remember how a previous sermon to ours related to you the contests
of the man; how throughout, even in the very number of his contests, he had maintained
the glory of the Holy Trinity, which he ever glorified; for there were three trying attacks that
he had to repel. You have heard the whole series of his labours, what he was in the first,
what in the middle, and what in the last. I deem it superfluous to repeat what has been so
well described. Yet it may not be out of place to add just so much as this. When that Church,
so sound in the faith, at the first beheld the man, she saw features truly formed2083 after the
image of God, she saw love welling forth, she saw grace poured around his lips, a consummate
perfection of humility beyond which it is impossible to conceive any thing further, a gentleness
like that of David, the understanding of Solomon, a goodness like that of Moses, a
strictness as of Samuel, a chastity as of Joseph, the skill of a Daniel, a zeal for the faith such
as was in the great Elijah, a purity of body like that of the lofty-minded John2084, an unsurpassable
love as of Paul. She saw the concurrence of so many excellences in one soul, and,
thrilled with a blessed affection, she loved him, her own bridegroom, with a pure and virtuous
passion. But ere she could accomplish her desire, ere she could satisfy her longing, while
still in the fervour of her passion, she was left desolate, when those trying times called the
athlete to his contests. While, then, he was engaged in these toilsome struggles for religion,
she remained chaste and kept the marriage vow. A long time intervened, during which one,
with adulterous intent2085, made an attempt upon the immaculate bridal-chamber. But the

Bride remained undefiled; and again there was a return, and again an exile. And thus it
happened thrice, until the Lord dispelled the gloom of that heresy, and sending forth a ray
of peace gave us the hope of some respite from these lengthened troubles2086. But when at
length they had seen each other, when there was a renewal of those chaste joys and spiritual
desires, when the flame of love had again been lit, all at once his last departure breaks off
the enjoyment. He came to adorn you as his bride, he failed not in the eagerness of his zeal,
he placed on this fair union the chaplets of blessing, in imitation of his Master. As did the
Lord at Cana of Galilee2087, so here did this imitator of Christ. The Jewish waterpots, which
were filled with the water of heresy, he filled with genuine wine, changing its nature by the
power of his faith. How often did he set before you a chalice, but not of wine, when with
that sweet voice he poured out in rich abundance the wine of Grace, and presented to you
the full and varied feast of reason! He went first with the blessing of his words, and then his
illustrious disciples were employed in distributing his teaching to the multitude.</p>
<p>We, too, were glad, and made our own the glory of your nation2088. Up to this point
how bright and happy is our narrative. What a blessed thing it were with this to bring our
sermon to an end. But after these things what follows? “Call for the mourning women2089,”
as says the prophet Jeremiah. In no other way can the burning heart cool down, swelling as
it is with its affliction, unless it relieves itself by sobs and tears. Formerly the hope of his return
consoled us for the pang of separation, but now he has been torn from us by that final separation.
A huge intervening chasm is fixed between the Church and him. He rests indeed
in the bosom of Abraham, but there exists not one who might bring the drop of water to
cool the tongue of the agonized. Gone is that beauty, silent is that voice, closed are those
lips, fled that grace. Our happy state has become a tale that is told. Elijah of old time caused
grief to the people of Israel when he soared from earth to God. But Elisha2090 consoled them
for the loss by being adorned with the mantle of his master. But now our wound is beyond
healing; our Elijah has been caught up, and no Elisha left behind in his place. You have

as a deserted city, and how among other expressions of passionate grief he added this, “The
ways of Zion do mourn2091.” These words were uttered then, but now they have been realized.
For when the news of our calamity shall have been spread abroad, then will the ways be full
of mourning crowds, and the sheep of his flock will pour themselves forth, and like the
Ninevites utter the voice of lamentation2092, or, rather, will lament more bitterly than they.
For in their case their mourning released them from the cause of their fear, but with these
no hope of release from their distress removes their need of mourning. I know, too, of another
utterance of Jeremiah, which is reckoned among the books of the Psalms2093; it is that
which he made over the captivity of Israel. The words run thus: “We hung our harps upon
the willows, and condemned ourselves as well as our harps to silence.” I make this song my
own. For when I see the confusion of heresy, this confusion is Babylon2094. And when I see
the flood of trials that pours in upon us from this confusion, I say that these are “the waters
of Babylon by which we sit down, and weep” because there is no one to guide us over them.
Even if you mention the willows, and the harps that hung thereon, that part also of the figure
shall be mine. For in truth our life is among willows2095, the willow being a fruitless tree,
and the sweet fruit of our life having all withered away. Therefore have we become fruitless
willows, and the harps of love we hung upon those trees are idle and unvibrating. “If I forget
thee, oh Jerusalem,” he adds, “may my right hand be forgotten.” Suffer me to make a slight
alteration in that text. It is not we who have forgotten the right hand, but the right hand that
has forgotten us: and the “tongue has cleaved to the roof of” his own “mouth,” and barred
the passage of his words, so that we can never again hear that sweet voice. But let me have
all tears wiped away, for I feel that I am indulging more than is right in this womanish sorrow
for our loss.</p>

our forerunner Christ has entered for us2096. He has left behind him the curtain of the flesh.
No longer does he pray to the type or shadow of the things in heaven, but he looks upon
the very embodiment of these realities. No longer through a glass darkly does he intercede
with God, but face to face he intercedes with Him: and he intercedes for us2097, and for the
“negligences and ignorances” of the people. He has put away the coats of skin2098; no need
is there now for the dwellers in paradise of such garments as these; but he wears the raiment
which the purity of his life has woven into a glorious dress. “Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death2099” of such a man, or rather it is not death, but the breaking of bonds, as it is
said, “Thou hast broken my bonds asunder.” Simeon has been let depart2100. He has been
freed from the bondage of the body. The “snare is broken and the bird hath flown away2101.”
He has left Egypt behind, this material life. He has crossed2102, not this Red Sea of ours, but
the black gloomy sea of life. He has entered upon the land of promise, and holds high converse
with God upon the mount. He has loosed the sandal of his soul, that with the pure
step of thought he may set foot upon that holy land where there is the Vision of God. Having
therefore, brethren, this consolation, do ye, who are conveying the bones of our Joseph to
the place of blessing, listen to the exhortation of Paul: “Sorrow not as others who have no
hope2103.” Speak to the people there; relate the glorious tale; speak of the incredible wonder,
how the people in their myriads, so densely crowded together as to look like a sea of heads,
became all one continuous body, and like some watery flood surged around the procession
bearing his remains. Tell them how the fair2104 David distributed himself, in divers ways

<head>On the Baptism of Christ.</head>
<head>A Sermon for the Day of the Lights.2113</head>
<p>Now I recognize my own flock: to-day I behold the wonted figure of the Church, when,
turning with aversion from the occupation even of the cares of the flesh, you come together
in your undiminished numbers for the service of God—when the people crowds the house,
coming within the sacred sanctuary, and when the multitude that can find no place within
fills the space outside in the precincts like bees. For of them some are at their labours within,
while others outside hum around the hive. So do, my children: and never abandon this zeal.
For I confess that I feel a shepherd’s affections, and I wish, when I am set upon this watchtower,
to see the flock gathered round about the mountain’s foot: and when it so happens
to me, I am filled with wonderful earnestness, and work with pleasure at my sermon, as the
shepherds do at their rustic strains. But when things are otherwise, and you are straying in
distant wanderings, as you did but lately, the last Lord’s Day, I am much troubled, and glad
to be silent; and I consider the question of flight from hence, and seek for the Carmel of the
prophet Elijah, or for some rock without inhabitant; for men in depression naturally choose
loneliness and solitude. But now, when I see you thronging here with all your families, I am
reminded of the prophetic saying, which Isaiah proclaimed from afar off, addressing by
anticipation the Church with her fair and numerous children:—“Who are these that fly as
a cloud, and as doves with their young to me2114”? Yes, and he adds moreover this also,
“The place is too strait for me; give place that I may dwell2115.” For these predictions the
power of the Spirit made with reference to the populous Church of God, which was afterwards
to fill the whole world from end to end of the earth.</p>
<p>The time, then, has come, and bears in its course the remembrance of holy mysteries,
purifying man,—mysteries which purge out from soul and body even that sin which is hard
to cleanse away, and which bring us back to that fairness of our first estate which God, the
best of artificers, impressed upon us. Therefore it is that you, the initiated people, are gathered
together; and you bring also that people who have not made trial of them, leading, like good
fathers, by careful guidance, the uninitiated to the perfect reception of the faith. I for my
part rejoice over both;—over you that are initiated, because you are enriched with a great
gift: over you that are uninitiated, because you have a fair expectation of hope—remission

<pb n="974"/>
of what is to be accounted for, release from bondage, close relation to God, free boldness of
speech, and in place of servile subjection equality with the angels. For these things, and all
that follow from them, the grace of Baptism secures and conveys to us. Therefore let us leave
the other matters of the Scriptures for other occasions, and abide by the topic set before us,
offering, as far as we may, the gifts that are proper and fitting for the feast: for each festival
demands its own treatment. So we welcome a marriage with wedding songs; for mourning
we bring the due offering with funeral strains; in times of business we speak seriously, at
times of festivity we relax the concentration and strain of our minds; but each time we keep
free from disturbance by things that are alien to its character.</p>
<p>Christ, then, was born as it were a few days ago—He Whose generation was before all
things, sensible and intellectual. To-day He is baptized by John that He might cleanse him
who was defiled, that He might bring the Spirit from above, and exalt man to heaven, that
he who had fallen might be raised up and he who had cast him down might be put to shame.
And marvel not if God showed so great earnestness in our cause: for it was with care on the
part of him who did us wrong that the plot was laid against us; it is with forethought on the
part of our Maker that we are saved. And he, that evil charmer, framing his new device of
sin against our race, drew along his serpent train, a disguise worthy of his own intent, entering
in his impurity into what was like himself,—dwelling, earthly and mundane as he was in
will, in that creeping thing. But Christ, the repairer of his evil-doing, assumes manhood in
its fulness, and saves man, and becomes the type and figure of us all, to sanctify the firstfruits
of every action, and leave to His servants no doubt in their zeal for the tradition.
Baptism, then, is a purification from sins, a remission of trespasses, a cause of renovation
and regeneration. By regeneration, understand regeneration conceived in thought, not discerned
by bodily sight. For we shall not, according to the Jew Nicodemus and his somewhat
dull intelligence, change the old man into a child, nor shall we form anew him who is
wrinkled and gray-headed to tenderness and youth, if we bring back the man again into his
mother’s womb: but we do bring back, by royal grace, him who bears the scars of sin, and
has grown old in evil habits, to the innocence of the babe. For as the child new-born is free
from accusations and from penalties, so too the child of regeneration has nothing for which
to answer, being released by royal bounty from accountability2116. And this gift it is not the
water that bestows (for in that case it were a thing more exalted than all creation), but the
command of God, and the visitation of the Spirit that comes sacramentally to set us free.
But water serves to express the cleansing. For since we are wont by washing in water to
render our body clean when it is soiled by dirt or mud, we therefore apply it also in the
sacramental action, and display the spiritual brightness by that which is subject to our senses.
<note type="footnote">2116 The language of this passage, if strictly taken, seems to imply a denial of original sin; but it is perhaps
not intended to be so understood.</note>

<pb n="975"/>
Let us however, if it seems well, persevere in enquiring more fully and more minutely concerning
Baptism, starting, as from the fountain-head, from the Scriptural declaration, “Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God2117.”
Why are both named, and why is not the Spirit alone accounted sufficient for the completion
of Baptism? Man, as we know full well, is compound, not simple: and therefore the cognate
and similar medicines are assigned for healing to him who is twofold and conglomerate:—for
his visible body, water, the sensible element,—for his soul, which we cannot see, the Spirit
invisible, invoked by faith, present unspeakably. For “the Spirit breathes where He wills,
and thou hearest His voice, but canst not tell whence He cometh or whither He goeth2118.”
He blesses the body that is baptized, and the water that baptizes. Despise not, therefore, the
Divine laver, nor think lightly of it, as a common thing, on account of the use of water. For
the power that operates is mighty, and wonderful are the things that are wrought thereby.
For this holy altar, too, by which I stand, is stone, ordinary in its nature, nowise different
from the other slabs of stone that build our houses and adorn our pavements; but seeing
that it was consecrated to the service of God, and received the benediction, it is a holy table,
an altar undefiled, no longer touched by the hands of all, but of the priests alone, and that
with reverence. The bread again is at first2119 common bread, but when the sacramental
action consecrates it, it is called, and becomes, the Body of Christ. So with the sacramental
oil; so with the wine: though before the benediction they are of little value, each of them,
after the sanctification bestowed by the Spirit, has its several operation. The same power of
the word, again, also makes the priest venerable and honourable, separated, by the new
blessing bestowed upon him, from his community with the mass of men. While but yesterday
he was one of the mass, one of the people, he is suddenly rendered a guide, a president, a
teacher of righteousness, an instructor in hidden mysteries; and this he does2120 without
being at all changed in body or in form; but, while continuing to be in all appearance the
man he was before, being, by some unseen power and grace, transformed in respect of his
unseen soul to the higher condition. And so there are many things, which if you consider
you will see that their appearance is contemptible, but the things they accomplish are mighty:
and this is especially the case when you collect from the ancient history2121 instances cognate
and similar to the subject of our inquiry. The rod of Moses was a hazel wand. And what is
that, but common wood that every hand cuts and carries, and fashions to what use it chooses,
and casts as it will into the fire? But when God was pleased to accomplish by that rod those

<note type="footnote">2120 That is, “these functions he fulfils.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2121 i.e.from the Old Testament Scriptures.</note>

<pb n="976"/>
wonders, lofty, and passing the power of language to express, the wood was changed into a
serpent. And again, at another time, he smote the waters, and now made the water blood,
now made to issue forth a countless brood of frogs: and again he divided the sea, severed
to its depths without flowing together again. Likewise the mantle of one of the prophets,
though it was but a goat’s skin, made Elisha renowned in the whole world. And the wood
of the Cross is of saving efficacy2122 for all men, though it is, as I am informed, a piece of a
poor tree, less valuable than most trees are. So a bramble bush showed to Moses the manifestation
of the presence of God: so the remains of Elisha raised a dead man to life; so clay
gave sight to him that was blind from the womb. And all these things, though they were
matter without soul or sense, were made the means for the performance of the great marvels
wrought by them, when they received the power of God. Now by a similar train of reasoning,
water also, though it is nothing else than water, renews the man to spiritual regeneration2123,
when the grace from above hallows it. And if any one answers me again by raising a difficulty,
with his questions and doubts, continually asking and inquiring how water and the sacramental
act that is performed therein regenerate, I most justly reply to him, “Show me the
mode of that generation which is after the flesh, and I will explain to you the power of regeneration
in the soul.” You will say perhaps, by way of giving an account of the matter, “It
is the cause of the seed which makes the man.” Learn then from us in return, that hallowed
water cleanses and illuminates the man. And if you again object to me your “How?” I shall
more vehemently cry in answer, “How does the fluid and formless substance become a
man?” and so the argument as it advances will be exercised on everything through all creation.
How does heaven exist? how earth? how sea? how every single thing? For everywhere men’s
reasoning, perplexed in the attempt at discovery, falls back upon this syllable “how,” as those
who cannot walk fall back upon a seat. To speak concisely, everywhere the power of God
and His operation are incomprehensible and incapable of being reduced to rule, easily
producing whatever He wills, while concealing from us the minute knowledge of His operation.
Hence also the blessed David, applying his mind to the magnificence of creation, and
filled with perplexed wonder in his soul, spake that verse which is sung by all, “O Lord, how
<note type="footnote">2122 The reference appears to be not to the Cross as the instrument of that Death which was of saving efficacy,
but to miraculous cures, real or reputed, effected by means of the actual wood of the Cross. The argument seems
to require that we should understand the Cross itself, and not only the sacrifice offered upon it, to be the means
of producing wondrous effects: and the grammatical construction favours this view. S. Cyril of Jerusalem mentions
the extensive distribution of fragments of the Cross (Cat. x. 19), but this is probably one of the earliest references
to miracles worked by their means.</note>

could take cognizance.</note>

<pb n="977"/>
manifold are Thy works: in wisdom hast Thou made them all2124.” The wisdom he perceived:
but the art of the wisdom he could not discover. Let us then leave the task of searching into
what is beyond human power, and seek rather that which shows signs of being partly within
our comprehension:—what is the reason why the cleansing is effected by water? and to what
purpose are the three immersions received? That which the fathers taught, and which our
mind has received and assented to, is as follows:—We recognize four elements, of which
the world is composed, which every one knows even if their names are not spoken; but if it
is well, for the sake of the more simple, to tell you their names, they are fire and air, earth
and water. Now our God and Saviour, in fulfilling the Dispensation for our sakes, went beneath
the fourth of these, the earth, that He might raise up life from thence. And we in receiving
Baptism, in imitation of our Lord and Teacher and Guide, are not indeed buried in
the earth (for this is the shelter of the body that is entirely dead, covering the infirmity and
decay of our nature), but coming to the element akin to earth, to water, we conceal ourselves
in that as the Saviour did in the earth: and by doing this thrice we represent for ourselves
that grace of the Resurrection which was wrought in three days: and this we do, not receiving
the sacrament in silence, but while there are spoken over us the Names of the Three Sacred
Persons on Whom we believed, in Whom we also hope, from Whom comes to us both the
fact of our present and the fact of our future existence. It may be thou art offended, thou
who contendest boldly against the glory of the Spirit, and that thou grudgest to the Spirit
that veneration wherewith He is reverenced by the godly. Leave off contending with me:
resist, if thou canst, those words of the Lord which gave to men the rule of the Baptismal
invocation. What says the Lord’s command? “Baptizing them in the Name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost2125.” How in the Name of the Father? Because He is
the primal cause of all things. How in the Name of the Son? Because He is the Maker of the
Creation. How in the Name of the Holy Ghost? Because He is the power perfecting all. We
bow ourselves therefore before the Father, that we may be sanctified: before the Son also
we bow, that the same end may be fulfilled: we bow also before the Holy Ghost, that we may
be made what He is in fact and in Name. There is not a distinction in the sanctification, in
the sense that the Father sanctifies more, the Son less, the Holy Spirit in a less degree than
the other Two. Why then dost thou divide the Three Persons into fragments of different
natures, and make Three Gods, unlike one to another, whilst from all thou dost receive one
and the same grace?</p>
<p>As, however, examples always render an argument more vivid to the hearers, I propose
to instruct the mind of the blasphemers by an illustration, explaining, by means of earthly

and lowly matters, those matters which are great, and invisible to the senses. If it befel thee
to be enduring the misfortune of captivity among enemies, to be in bondage and in misery,
to be groaning for that ancient freedom which thou once hadst—and if all at once three
men, who were notable men and citizens in the country of thy tyrannical masters, set thee
free from the constraint that lay upon thee, giving thy ransom equally, and dividing the
charges of the money in equal shares among themselves, wouldst thou not then, meeting
with this favour, look upon the three alike as benefactors, and make repayment of the ransom
to them in equal shares, as the trouble and the cost on thy behalf was common to them
all—if, that is, thou wert a fair judge of the benefit done to thee? This we may see, so far as
illustration goes2126, for our aim at present is not to render a strict account of the Faith. Let
us return to the present season, and to the subject it sets before us.</p>
<p>I find that not only do the Gospels, written after the Crucifixion, proclaim the grace of
Baptism, but, even before the Incarnation of our Lord, the ancient Scripture everywhere
prefigured the likeness of our regeneration; not clearly manifesting its form, but foreshowing,
in dark sayings, the love of God to man. And as the Lamb was proclaimed by anticipation,
and the Cross was foretold by anticipation, so, too, was Baptism shown forth by
action and by word. Let us recall its types to those who love good thoughts—for the festival
season of necessity demands their recollection.</p>
<p>Hagar, the handmaid of Abraham (whom Paul treats allegorically in reasoning with the
Galatians2127), being sent forth from her master’s house by the anger of Sarah—for a servant
suspected in regard to her master is a hard thing for lawful wives to bear—was wandering
in desolation to a desolate land with her babe Ishmael at her breast. And when she was in
straits for the needs of life, and was herself nigh unto death, and her child yet more sore for
the water in the skin was spent (since it was not possible that the Synagogue, she who once
dwelt among the figures of the perennial Fountain, should have all that was needed to support
life), an angel unexpectedly appears, and shows her a well of living water, and drawing
thence, she saves Ishmael. Behold, then, a sacramental type: how from the very first it is by
the means of living water that salvation comes to him that was perishing—water that was
not before, but was given as a boon by an angel’s means. Again, at a later time, Isaac—the
same for whose sake Ishmael was driven with his mother from his father’s home—was to
be wedded. Abraham’s servant is sent to make the match, so as to secure a bride for his
master, and finds Rebekah at the well: and a marriage that was to produce the race of Christ
<note type="footnote">2126 The meaning of this clause may be, either that Gregory does not propose to follow this point out, as the
subject of his discourse is Baptism, not the doctrine of the Trinity; or, that the example he has given is not to be
so pressed as to imply tritheism, being merely an illustration of moral obligation, not a parallel from which
anything is to be inferred as to the exact relation between the Three Persons.</note>

had its beginning and its first covenant in water2128. Yes, and Isaac himself also, when he
was ruling his flocks, digged wells at all parts of the desert, which the aliens stopped and
filled up2129, for a type of all those impious men of later days who hindered the grace of
Baptism, and talked loudly in their struggle against the truth. Yet the martyrs and the priests
overcame them by digging the wells, and the gift of Baptism over-flowed the whole world.
According to the same force of the text, Jacob also, hastening to seek a bride, met Rachel
unexpectedly at the well. And a great stone lay upon the well, which a multitude of shepherds
were wont to roll away when they came together, and then gave water to themselves and to
their flocks. But Jacob alone rolls away the stone, and waters the flocks of his spouse2130.
The thing is, I think, a dark saying, a shadow of what should come. For what is the stone
that is laid but Christ Himself? for of Him Isaiah says, “And I will lay in the foundations of
Sion a costly stone, precious, elect2131:” and Daniel likewise, “A stone was cut out without
hands2132,” that is, Christ was born without a man. For as it is a new and marvellous thing
that a stone should be cut out of the rock without a hewer or stone-cutting tools, so it is a
thing beyond all wonder that an offspring should appear from an unwedded Virgin. There
was lying, then, upon the well the spiritual2133 stone, Christ, concealing in the deep and in
mystery the laver of regeneration which needed much time—as it were a long rope—to
bring it to light. And none rolled away the stone save Israel, who is mind seeing God. But
he both draws up the water and gives drink to the sheep of Rachel; that is, he reveals the
hidden mystery, and gives living water to the flock of the Church. Add to this also the history
of the three rods of Jacob2134. For from the time when the three rods were laid by the well,
Laban the polytheist thenceforth became poor, and Jacob became rich and wealthy in herds.
Now let Laban be interpreted of the devil, and Jacob of Christ. For after the institution of
Baptism Christ took away all the flock of Satan and Himself grew rich. Again, the great
Moses, when he was a goodly child, and yet at the breast, falling under the general and cruel
decree which the hard-hearted Pharaoh made against the men-children, was exposed on
the banks of the river—not naked, but laid in an ark, for it was fitting that the Law should
typically be enclosed in a coffer2135. And he was laid near the water; for the Law, and those
daily sprinklings of the Hebrews which were a little later to be made plain in the perfect and

the people itself, by passing through the Red Sea, proclaimed the good tidings of salvation
by water. The people passed over, and the Egyptian king with his host was engulfed, and by
these actions this Sacrament was foretold. For even now, whensoever the people is in the
water of regeneration, fleeing from Egypt, from the burden of sin, it is set free and saved;
but the devil with his own servants (I mean, of course, the spirits of evil), is choked with
grief, and perishes, deeming the salvation of men to be his own misfortune.</p>
<p>Even these instances might be enough to confirm our present position; but the lover of
good thoughts must yet not neglect what follows. The people of the Hebrews, as we learn,
after many sufferings, and after accomplishing their weary course in the desert, did not enter
the land of promise until it had first been brought, with Joshua for its guide and the pilot
of its life, to the passage of the Jordan2137. But it is clear that Joshua also, who set up the
twelve stones in the stream2138, was anticipating the coming of the twelve disciples, the
ministers of Baptism. Again, that marvellous sacrifice of the old Tishbite2139, that passes all
human understanding, what else does it do but prefigure in action the Faith in the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and redemption? For when all the people of the Hebrews had
trodden underfoot the religion of their fathers, and fallen into the error of polytheism, and
their king Ahab was deluded by idolatry, with Jezebel, of ill-omened name, as the wicked
partner of his life, and the vile prompter of his impiety, the prophet, filled with the grace of
the Spirit, coming to a meeting with Ahab, withstood the priests of Baal in a marvellous and
wondrous contest in the sight of the king and all the people; and by proposing to them the
task of sacrificing the bullock without fire, he displayed them in a ridiculous and wretched
plight, vainly praying and crying aloud to gods that were not. At last, himself invoking his
own and the true God, he accomplished the test proposed with further exaggerations and
additions. For he did not simply by prayer bring down the fire from heaven upon the wood
when it was dry, but exhorted and enjoined the attendants to bring abundance of water.
And when he had thrice poured out the barrels upon the cleft wood, he kindled at his
prayer the fire from out of the water, that by the contrariety of the elements, so concurring
in friendly cooperation, he might show with superabundant force the power of his own
God. Now herein, by that wondrous sacrifice, Elijah clearly proclaimed to us the sacramental
rite of Baptism that should afterwards be instituted. For the fire was kindled by water thrice
poured upon it, so that it is clearly shown that where the mystic water is, there is the kindling,
warm, and fiery Spirit, that burns up the ungodly, and illuminates the faithful. Yes, and yet

again his disciple Elisha, when Naaman the Syrian, who was diseased with leprosy, had come
to him as a suppliant, cleanses the sick man by washing him in Jordan2140, clearly indicating
what should come, both by the use of water generally, and by the dipping in the river in
particular. For Jordan alone of rivers, receiving in itself the first-fruits of sanctification and
benediction, conveyed in its channel to the whole world, as it were from some fount in the
type afforded by itself, the grace of Baptism. These then are indications in deed and act of
regeneration by Baptism. Let us for the rest consider the prophecies of it in words and language.
Isaiah cried saying, “Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your souls2141;”
and David, “Draw nigh to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed2142.”
And Ezekiel, writing more clearly and plainly than them both, says, “And I will sprinkle
clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed: from all your filthiness, and from all your
idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I give you:
and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh,
and my Spirit will I put within you2143.” Most manifestly also does Zechariah prophesy of
Joshua2144, who was clothed with the filthy garment (to wit, the flesh of a servant, even
ours), and stripping him of his ill-favoured raiment adorns him with the clean and fair ap-
parel; teaching us by the figurative illustration that verily in the Baptism of Jesus2145 all we,
putting off our sins like some poor and patched garment, are clothed in the holy and most
fair garment of regeneration. And where shall we place that oracle of Isaiah, which cries to
the wilderness, “Be glad, O thirsty wilderness: let the desert rejoice and blossom as a lily:
and the desolate places of Jordan shall blossom and shall rejoice2146”? For it is clear that it
is not to places without soul or sense that he proclaims the good tidings of joy: but he speaks,
by the figure of the desert, of the soul that is parched and unadorned, even as David also,
when he says, “My soul is unto Thee as a thirsty land2147,” and, “My soul is athirst for the
mighty, for the living God2148.” So again the Lord says in the Gospels, “If any man thirst,

<note type="footnote">2144 Cf. Zech. iii. 3. It is to be remembered, of course, that the form of the name in the Septuagint is not
Joshua but Jesus.</note>
<note type="footnote">2145 If “the Baptism of Jesus” here means (as seems most likely) the Baptism of our Lord by S. John, not the
Baptism instituted by our Lord, then we are apparently intended to understand that our Lord, summing up
humanity in Himself, represented by His Baptism that of all who should thereafter be baptized.</note>

let him come unto Me and drink2149;” and to the woman of Samaria, “Whosoever drinketh
of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
shall never thirst2150.” And “the excellency of Carmel”2151 is given to the soul that bears
the likeness to the desert, that is, the grace bestowed through the Spirit. For since Elijah
dwelt in Carmel, and the mountain became famous and renowned by the virtue of him who
dwelt there, and since moreover John the Baptist, illustrious in the spirit of Elijah, sanctified
the Jordan, therefore the prophet foretold that “the excellency of Carmel” should be given
to the river. And “the glory of Lebanon2152,” from the similitude of its lofty trees, he transfers
to the river. For as great Lebanon presents a sufficient cause of wonder in the very trees
which it brings forth and nourishes, so is the Jordan glorified by regenerating men and
planting them in the Paradise of God: and of them, as the words of the Psalmist say, ever
blooming and bearing the foliage of virtues, “the leaf shall not wither2153,” and God shall
be glad, receiving their fruit in due season, rejoicing, like a good planter, in his own works.
And the inspired David, foretelling also the voice which the Father uttered from heaven
upon the Son at His Baptism, that He might lead the hearers, who till then had looked upon
that low estate of His Humanity which was perceptible by their senses, to the dignity of
nature that belongs to the Godhead, wrote in his book that passage, “The voice of the Lord
is upon the waters, the voice of the Lord in majesty2154.” But here we must make an end of
the testimonies from the Divine Scriptures: for the discourse would extend to an infinite
length if one should seek to select every passage in detail, and set them forth in a single book.</p>
<p>But do ye all, as many as are made glad, by the gift of regeneration, and make your boast
of that saving renewal, show me, after the sacramental grace, the change in your ways that
should follow it, and make known by the purity of your conversation the difference effected
by your transformation for the better. For of those things which are before our eyes nothing
is altered: the characteristics of the body remain unchanged, and the mould of the visible
nature is nowise different. But there is certainly need of some manifest proof, by which we
may recognize the new-born man, discerning by clear tokens the new from the old. And
these I think are to be found in the intentional motions of the soul, whereby it separates itself
from its old customary life, and enters on a newer way of conversation, and will clearly teach
those acquainted with it that it has become something different from its former self, bearing
in it no token by which the old self was recognized. This, if you be persuaded by me, and

keep my words as a law, is the mode of the transformation. The man that was before Baptism
was wanton, covetous, grasping at the goods of others, a reviler, a liar, a slanderer, and all
that is kindred with these things, and consequent from them. Let him now become orderly,
sober, content with his own possessions, and imparting from them to those in poverty,
truthful, courteous, affable—in a word, following every laudable course of conduct. For as
darkness is dispelled by light, and black disappears as whiteness is spread over it, so the old
man also disappears when adorned with the works of righteousness. Thou seest how Zacchæus
also by the change of his life slew the publican, making fourfold restitution to those
whom he had unjustly damaged, and the rest he divided with the poor—the treasure which
he had before got by ill means from the poor whom he oppressed. The Evangelist Matthew,
another publican, of the same business with Zacchæus, at once after his call changed his life
as if it had been a mask. Paul was a persecutor, but after the grace bestowed on him an
Apostle, bearing the weight of his fetters for Christ’s sake, as an act of amends and repentance
for those unjust bonds which he once received from the Law, and bore for use against the
Gospel. Such ought you to be in your regeneration: so ought you to blot out your habits that
tend to sin; so ought the sons of God to have their conversation: for after the grace bestowed
we are called His children. And therefore we ought narrowly to scrutinize our Father’s
characteristics, that by fashioning and framing ourselves to the likeness of our Father, we
may appear true children of Him Who calls us to the adoption according to grace. For the
bastard and the supposititious son, who belies his father’s nobility in his deeds, is a sad reproach.
Therefore also, methinks, it is that the Lord Himself, laying down for us in the
Gospels the rules of our life, uses these words to His disciples, “Do good to them that hate
you, pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you; that ye may be the children
of your Father which is in heaven: for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust2155.” For then He says they are sons when
in their own modes of thought they are fashioned in loving kindness towards their kindred,
after the likeness of the Father’s goodness.</p>
<p>Therefore, also, it is that after the dignity of adoption the devil plots more vehemently
against us, pining away with envious glance, when he beholds the beauty of the new-born
man, earnestly tending towards that heavenly city, from which he fell: and he raises up
against us fiery temptations, seeking earnestly to despoil us of that second adornment, as
he did of our former array. But when we are aware of his attacks, we ought to repeat to
ourselves the apostolic words, “As many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized
into His death2156.” Now if we have been conformed to His death, sin henceforth in us is
surely a corpse, pierced through by the javelin of Baptism, as that fornicator was thrust
<note type="footnote">2155 S. Matt. v. 44</note>
<note type="footnote">2156 Rom. vi. 3.</note>

<pb n="984"/>
through by the zealous Phinehas2157. Flee therefore from us, ill-omened one! for it is a
corpse thou seekest to despoil, one long ago joined to thee, one who long since lost his senses
for pleasures. A corpse is not enamoured of bodies, a corpse is not captivated by wealth, a
corpse slanders not, a corpse lies not, snatches not at what is not its own, reviles not those
who encounter it. My way of living is regulated for another life: I have learnt to despise the
things that are in the world, to pass by the things of earth, to hasten to the things of heaven,
even as Paul expressly testifies, that the world is crucified to him, and he to the world2158.
These are the words of a soul truly regenerated: these are the utterances of the newly-baptized
man, who remembers his own profession, which he made to God when the sacrament was
administered to him, promising that he would despise for the sake of love towards Him all
torment and all pleasure alike.</p>
<p>And now we have spoken sufficiently for the holy subject of the day, which the circling
year brings to us at appointed periods. We shall do well in what remains to end our discourse
by turning it to the loving Giver of so great a boon, offering to Him a few words as the requital
of great things. For Thou verily, O Lord, art the pure and eternal fount of goodness,
Who didst justly turn away from us, and in loving kindness didst have mercy upon us. Thou
didst hate, and wert reconciled; Thou didst curse, and didst bless; Thou didst banish us from
Paradise, and didst recall us; Thou didst strip off the fig-tree leaves, an unseemly covering,
and put upon us a costly garment; Thou didst open the prison, and didst release the condemned;
Thou didst sprinkle us with clean water, and cleanse us from our filthiness. No
longer shall Adam be confounded when called by Thee, nor hide himself, convicted by his
conscience, cowering in the thicket of Paradise. Nor shall the flaming sword encircle Paradise
around, and make the entrance inaccessible to those that draw near; but all is turned to joy
for us that were the heirs of sin: Paradise, yea, heaven itself may be trodden by man: and
the creation, in the world and above the world, that once was at variance with itself, is knit
together in friendship: and we men are made to join in the angels’ song, offering the worship
of their praise to God. For all these things then let us sing to God that hymn of joy, which
lips touched by the Spirit long ago sang loudly: “Let my soul be joyful in the Lord: for He
hath clothed me with a garment of salvation, and hath put upon me a robe of gladness: as
on a bridegroom He hath set a mitre upon me, and as a bride hath He adorned me with fair
array2159.” And verily the Adorner of the bride is Christ, Who is, and was, and shall be,
blessed now and for evermore. Amen.</p>

<head>Letter I.—To Eusebius2161.</head>
<p>When the length of the day begins to expand in winter-time, as the sun mounts to the
upper part of his course, we keep the feast of the appearing of the true Light divine, that
through the veil of flesh has cast its bright beams upon the life of men: but now when that
luminary has traversed half the heaven in his course, so that night and day are of equal
length, the upward return of human nature from death to life is the theme of this great and
universal festival, which all the life of those who have embraced the mystery of the Resurrection
unites in celebrating. What is the meaning of the subject thus suggested for my letter
to you? Why, since it is the custom in these general holidays for us to take every way to show
the affection harboured in our hearts, and some, as you know, give proof of their good will
by presents of their own, we thought it only right not to leave you without the homage of
our gifts, but to lay before your lofty and high-minded soul the scanty offerings of our
poverty. Now our offering which is tendered for your acceptance in this letter is the letter
itself, in which there is not a single word wreathed with the flowers of rhetoric or adorned
with the graces of composition, to make it to be deemed a gift at all in literary circles, but
the mystical gold, which is wrapped up in the faith of Christians, as in a packet2162, must
be my present to you, after being unwrapped, as far as possible, by these lines, and showing
its hidden brilliancy. Accordingly we must return to our prelude. Why is it that then only,
when the night has attained its utmost length, so that no further addition is possible, that

Universe by His own power, Who cannot be contained even by all intelligible things, but
includes the whole, even at the time that He enters the narrow dwelling of a fleshly tabernacle,
while His mighty power thus keeps pace with His beneficent purpose, and shows itself even
as a shadow wherever the will inclines, so that neither in the creation of the world was the
power found weaker than the will, nor when He was eager to stoop down to the lowliness
of our mortal nature did He lack power to that very end, but actually did come to be in that
condition, yet without leaving the universe unpiloted2163? Since, then, there is some account
to be given of both those seasons, how it is that it is winter-time when He appears in the
flesh, but it is when the days are as long as the nights that He restores to life man, who because
of his sins returned to the earth from whence he came,—by explaining the reason of this,
as well as I can in few words, I will make my letter my present to you. Has your own sagacity,
as of course it has, already divined the mystery hinted at by these coincidences; that the advance
of night is stopped by the accessions to the light, and the period of darkness begins
to be shortened, as the length of the day is increased by the successive additions? For thus
much perhaps would be plain enough even to the uninitiated, that sin is near akin to darkness;
and in fact evil is so termed by the Scripture. Accordingly the season in which our mystery
of godliness begins is a kind of exposition of the Divine dispensation on behalf of our souls.
For meet and right it was that, when vice was shed abroad2164 without bounds, [upon this
night of evil the Sun of righteousness should rise, and that in us who have before walked in
darkness2165] the day which we receive from Him Who placed that light in our hearts should
increase more and more; so that the life which is in the light should be extended to the
greatest length possible, being constantly augmented by additions of good; and that the life
in vice should by gradual subtraction be reduced to the smallest possible compass; for the
increase of things good comes to the same thing as the diminution of things evil. But the
feast of the Resurrection; occurring when the days are of equal length, of itself gives us this
interpretation of the coincidence, namely, that we shall no longer fight with evils only upon
equal terms, vice grappling with virtue in indecisive strife, but that the life of light will prevail,
the gloom of idolatry melting as the day waxes stronger. For this reason also, after the moon
has run her course for fourteen days, Easter exhibits her exactly opposite to the rays of the
sun, full with all the wealth of his brightness, and not permitting any interval of darkness
to take place in its turn2166: for, after taking the place of the sun at its setting, she does not

<head>Letter II.—To the City of Sebasteia2167.</head>
<p>Some of the brethren whose heart is as our heart told us of the slanders that were being
propagated to our detriment by those who hate peace, and privily backbite their neighbour;
and have no fear of the great and terrible judgment-seat of Him Who has declared that account
will be required even of idle words in that trial of our life which we must all look for:
they say that the charges which are being circulated against us are such as these; that we
entertain opinions opposed to those who at Nicæa set forth the right and sound faith, and
that without due discrimination and inquiry we received into the communion of the Catholic
Church those who formerly assembled at Ancyra under the name of Marcellus. Therefore,
that falsehood may not overpower the truth, in another letter we made a sufficient defence
against the charges levelled at us, and before the Lord we protested that we had neither departed
from the faith of the Holy Fathers, nor had we done anything without due discrimination
and inquiry in the case of those who came over from the communion of Marcellus
to that of the Church: but all that we did we did only after the orthodox in the East, and our
brethren in the ministry had entrusted to us the consideration of the case of these persons,
and had approved our action. But inasmuch as, since we composed that written defence of
our conduct, again some of the brethren who are of one mind with us begged us to make
separately2168 with our own lips a profession of our faith, which we entertain with full
conviction2169, following as we do the utterances of inspiration and the tradition of the
Fathers, we deemed it necessary to discourse briefly of these heads as well. We confess that
the doctrine of the Lord, which He taught His disciples, when He delivered to them the
mystery of godliness, is the foundation and root of right and sound faith, nor do we believe
<note type="footnote">2167 Marcellus of Ancyra had been deposed in the Council of Constantinople in 336, for teaching the doctrine
of Paul of Samosata. Basil and Athanasius successively separated from their communion all who were united
to Marcellus; and these, knowing that Valens the Emperor had exiled several bishops of Egypt to Diocæsarea,
went to find them (375) and were admitted to their communion. Armed with letters from them, they demanded
to be received into that of the other bishops of the East, and at length Basil and others, having examined the
matter closely, admitted them. Gregory followed Basil’s example, being assured of their Catholicity: and to justify
himself wrote this letter to the Catholics of Sebasteia.</note>

the Latin translation of this passage in Gregory, “(professionem) quâ sacris nos Scripturis ac Patrum traditioni

adopted, “we are fully believed to follow,” with a very harsh construction.</note>

<pb n="990"/>
that there is aught else loftier or safer than that tradition. Now the doctrine of the Lord is
this: “Go,” He said, “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Since, then, in the case of those who are regenerate from death
to eternal life, it is through the Holy Trinity that the life-giving power is bestowed on those
who with faith are deemed worthy of the grace, and in like manner the grace is imperfect,
if any one, whichever it be, of the names of the Holy Trinity be omitted in the saving bap-
tism—for the sacrament of regeneration is not completed in the Son and the Father alone
without the Spirit: nor is the perfect boon of life imparted to Baptism in the Father and the
Spirit, if the name of the Son be suppressed: nor is the grace of that Resurrection accomplished
in the Father and the Son, if the Spirit be left out2170:—for this reason we rest all
our hope, and the persuasion of the salvation of our souls, upon the three Persons, recognized2171
by these names; and we believe in the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the
Fountain of life, and in the Only-begotten Son of the Father, Who is the Author of life, as
saith the Apostle, and in the Holy Spirit of God, concerning Whom the Lord hath spoken,
“It is the Spirit that quickeneth”. And since on us who have been redeemed from death the
grace of immortality is bestowed, as we have said, through faith in the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, guided by these we believe that nothing servile, nothing created, nothing
unworthy of the majesty of the Father is to be associated in thought with the Holy Trinity;
since, I say, our life is one which comes to us by faith in the Holy Trinity, taking its rise from
the God of all, flowing through the Son, and working in us by the Holy Spirit. Having, then,
this full assurance, we are baptized as we were commanded, and we believe as we are baptized,
and we hold as we believe; so that with one accord our baptism, our faith, and our ascription
of praise are to2172 the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. But if any one makes
mention of two or three Gods, or of three God-heads, let him be accursed. And if any, following
the perversion of Arius, says that the Son or the Holy Spirit were produced from
things that are not, let him be accursed. But as many as walk by the rule of truth and acknowledge
the three Persons, devoutly recognized in Their several properties, and believe that
there is one Godhead, one goodness, one rule, one authority and power, and neither make
void the supremacy of the Sole-sovereignty2173, nor fall away into polytheism, nor confound
the Persons, nor make up the Holy Trinity of heterogeneous and unlike elements, but in

<head>Letter III.—To Ablabius2174.</head>
<p>The Lord, as was meet and right, brought us safe through, accompanied as we had been
by your prayers, and I will tell you a manifest token of His loving kindness. For when the
sun was just over the spot which we left behind Earsus2175, suddenly the clouds gathered
thick, and there was a change from clear sky to deep gloom. Then a chilly breeze blowing
through the clouds, bringing a drizzling with it, and striking upon us with a very damp
feeling, threatened such rain as had never yet been known, and on the left there were continuous
claps of thunder, and keen flashes of lightning alternated with the thunder, following
one crash and preceding the next, and all the mountains before, behind, and on each side
were shrouded in clouds. And already a heavy2176 cloud hung over our heads, caught by a
strong wind and big with rain, and yet we, like the Israelites of old in their miraculous passage
of the Red Sea, though surrounded on all sides by rain, arrived unwetted at Vestena. And
when we had already found shelter there, and our mules had got a rest, then the signal for
the down-pour was given by God to the air. And when we had spent some three or four
hours there, and had rested enough, again God stayed the down-fall, and our conveyance
moved along more briskly than before, as the wheel easily slid through the mud just moist
and on the surface. Now the road from that point to our little town is all along the river side,
going down stream with the water, and there is a continuous string of villages along the
banks, all close upon the road, and with very short distances between them. In consequence
of this unbroken line of habitations all the road was full of people, some coming to meet us,
and others escorting us, mingling tears in abundance with their joy. Now there was a little
drizzle, not unpleasant, just enough to moisten the air; but a little way before we got home
the cloud that overhung us was condensed into a more violent shower, so that our entrance
was quite quiet, as no one was aware beforehand of our coming. But just as we got inside
our portico, as the sound of our carriage wheels along the dry hard ground was heard, the

people turned up in shoals, as though by some mechanical contrivance, I know not whence
nor how, flocking round us so closely that it was not easy to get down from our conveyance,
for there was not a foot of clear space. But after we had persuaded them with difficulty to
allow us to get down, and to let our mules pass, we were crushed on every side by folks
crowding round, insomuch that their excessive kindness all but made us faint. And when
we were near the inside of the portico, we see a stream of fire flowing into the church; for
the choir of virgins, carrying their wax torches in their hands, were just marching in file
along the entrance of the church, kindling the whole into splendour with their blaze. And
when I was within and had rejoiced and wept with my people—for I experienced both
emotions from witnessing both in the multitude,—as soon as I had finished the prayers, I

<head>Letter IV.—To Cynegius2177.</head>
<p>We have a law that bids us “rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that
weep”: but of these commandments it often seems that it is in our power to put only one
into practice. For there is a great scarcity in the world of “them that rejoice,” so that it is not
easy to find with whom we may share our blessings, but there are plenty who are in the opposite
case. I write thus much by way of preface, because of the sad tragedy which some
spiteful power has been playing among people of long-standing nobility. A young man of
good family, Synesius by name, not unconnected with myself, in the full flush of youth, who
has scarcely begun to live yet, is in great dangers, from which God alone has power to rescue
him, and next to God, you, who are entrusted with the decisions of all questions of life and
death. An involuntary mishap has taken place. Indeed, what mishap is voluntary? And now
those who have made up this suit against him, carrying with it the penalty of death, have
turned his mishap into matter of accusation. However, I will try by private letters to soften
their resentment and incline them to pity; but I beseech your kindliness to side with justice
and with us, that your benevolence may prevail over the wretched plight of the youth,
hunting up any and every device by which the young man may be placed out of the reach
of danger, having conquered the spiteful power which assails him by the help of your alliance.
I have said all that I want in brief; but to go into details, in order that my endeavour may be
successful, would be to say what I have no business to say, nor you to hear from me.</p>
<note type="footnote">2177 Cynegius was “prefect of the prætorium,” from 384 to 390. Cod. Medic. has on the title, ῾ΙερίU+0026 251·
῾Ηγέμονι: but this must be wrong. It was this Cynegius, not then Prefect of the East, whom Libanius was to lead
however unwilling, to the study of eloquence (see end of Letter xi.). The four Prætorian Prefects remained, after
Diocletian’s institution of the four Princes, under whom they served, had been abolished by Constantine. The
Prefect of the East stretched his jurisdiction “from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis, and from
the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Persia.” From all inferior jurisdictions an appeal in every matter of
importance, either civil or criminal, might be brought before the tribunal of the Prefect; but his sentence was
final: the emperors themselves refused to dispute it. Hence Gregory says, that, “next to God, Cynegius had the
power to remove his young relative from danger.” How intimate Gregory was, not only with the highest officers,
but at the Court itself, is shown in his orations on Pulcheria and Flacilla. He must have been over sixty when

<head>Letter V.—A Testimonial.</head>
<p>That for which the king of the Macedonians is most admired by people of understanding,—
for he is admired not so much for his famous victories2178 over the Persians and Indians,
and his penetrating as far the Ocean, as for his saying that he had his treasure in his
friends;—in this respect I dare to compare myself with his marvellous exploits, and it will
be right for me to utter such a sentiment too. Now because I am rich in friendships, perhaps
I surpass in that kind of property even that great man who plumed himself upon that very
thing. For who was such a friend to him as you are to me, perpetually endeavouring to surpass
yourself in every kind of excellence? For assuredly no one would ever charge me with flattery,
when I say this, if he were to look at my age and your life: for grey hairs are out of season
for flattery, and old age is ill-suited for complaisance, and as for you, even if you are ever in
season for flattery, yet praise would not fall under the suspicion of flattery, as your life shows
forth your praise before words. But since, when men are rich in blessings, it is a special gift
to know how to use what one has, and the best use of superfluities is to let one’s friends
share them with one, and since my beloved son Alexander is most of all a friend united to
me in all sincerity, be persuaded to show him my treasure, and not only to show it to him,
but also to put it at his disposal to enjoy abundantly, by extending to him your protection
in those matters about which he has come to you, begging you to be his patron. He will tell
you all with his own lips. For it is better so than that I should go into details in a letter.</p>

<p>They say that conjurors2179 in theatres contrive some such marvel as this which I am
going to describe. Having taken some historical narrative, or some old story as the groundplot
of their sleight of hand, they relate the story to the spectators in action. And it is in this
way that they make their representations of the narrative2180. They put on their dresses and
masks, and rig up something to resemble a town on the stage with hangings, and then so
associate the bare scene with their life-like imitation of action that they are a marvel to the
spectators—both the actors themselves of the incidents of the play, and the hangings, or
rather their imaginary city. What do I mean, do you think, by this allegory? Since we must
needs show to those who are coming together that which is not a city as though it were one,
do you let yourself be persuaded to become for the nonce the founder of our city2181, by
just putting in an appearance there; I will make the desert-place seem to be a city; now it is
no great distance for you, and the favour which you will confer is very great; for we wish to

whether it be teeming with green blades, or waving with fruitful ears as is the spring
of the soul, lit up with your peaceful beams, from the radiance which shone in your letter,
which raised our life from despondency to gladness? For thus, perhaps, it will not be unfitting
to adapt the word of the prophet to our present blessings: “In the multitude of the sorrows
which I had in my heart, the comforts of God,” by your kindness, “have refreshed my
soul,”2182 like sunbeams, cheering and warming our life nipped by frost. For both reached
the highest pitch—the severity of my troubles, I mean, on the one side, and the sweetness
of your favours on the other. And if you have so gladdened us, by only sending us the joyful
tidings of your coming, that everything changed for us from extremest woe to a bright
condition, what will your precious and benign coming, even the sight of it, do? what consolation
will the sound of your sweet voice in our ears afford our soul? May this speedily come
to pass, by the good help of God, Who giveth respite from pain to the fainting, and rest to
the afflicted. But be assured, that when we look at our own case we grieve exceedingly at
the present state of things, and men cease not to tear us in pieces2183: but when we turn our
eyes to your excellence, we own that we have great cause for thankfulness to the dispensation

<head>Letter VIII2185.—To a Student of the Classics.</head>
<p>When I was looking for some suitable and proper exordium, I mean of course from
Holy Scripture, to put at the head of my letter, according to my usual custom, I did not
know which to choose, not from inability to find what was suitable, but because I deemed
it superfluous to write such things to those who knew nothing about the matter. For your
eager pursuit of profane literature proved incontestably to us that you did not care about
sacred. Accordingly I will say nothing about Bible texts, but will select a prelude adapted to
your literary tastes taken from the poets you love so well. By the great master of your education
there is introduced one, showing all an old man’s joy, when after long affliction he once
more beheld his son, and his son’s son as well. And the special theme of his exultation is
the rivalry between the two, Ulysses and Telemachus, for the highest meed of valour, though
it is true that the recollection of his own exploits against the Cephallenians adds to the point
of his speech2186. For you and your admirable father, when you welcomed me, as they did
Laertes, in your affection, contended in most honourable rivalry for the prize of virtue, by
showing us all possible respect and kindness; he in numerous ways which I need not here
mention, and you by pelting me with2187 your letters from Cappadocia. What, then, of me
the aged one? I count that day one to be blessed, in which I witness such a competition
between father and son. May you, then, never cease from accomplishing the rightful prayer
of an excellent and admirable father, and surpassing in your readiness to all good works the
renown which from him you inherit. I shall be a judge acceptable to both of you, as I shall
award you the first prize against your father, and the same to your father against you. And
we will put up with rough Ithaca, rough not so much with stones as with the manners of
the inhabitants, an island in which there are many suitors, who are suitors2188 most of all
for the possessions of her whom they woo, and insult their intended bride by this very fact,
that they threaten her chastity with marriage, acting in a way worthy of a Melantho, one

at the generous rivalry between Ulysses and Telemachus, though his mention of his exploits against the Cephallenians
shall also contribute to illustrate our discussion;” but this can hardly be got out of the Greek. The reference
is to Odyssey, xxiv. 514. Gregory was evidently fond of Homer: the comparison of Diomede to a winter torrent
(Iliad, v. 87) is used De Virginit. c. 4: and Menelaus’ words about the young and old (Iliad, iii. 108), c. 23: and
in Letter II. of the seven edited by Caraccioli (Letter XV.) describing the gardens of Vanota, Od. vii. 115, xiii.

might say, or some other such person; for nowhere is there a Ulysses to bring them to their

consideration of my grey hairs; for garrulity is just as characteristic of old age as to be bleareyed,
or for the limbs to fail2189. But you by entertaining us with your brisk and lively language,

<head>Letter IX.—An Invitation.</head>
<p>It is not the natural wont of spring to shine forth in its radiant beauty all at once, but
there come as preludes of spring the sunbeam gently warming earth’s frozen surface, and
the bud half hidden beneath the clod, and breezes blowing over the earth, so that the fertilizing
and generative power of the air penetrates deeply into it. One may see the fresh and
tender grass, and the return of birds which winter had banished, and many such tokens,
which are rather signs of spring, not spring itself. Not but that these are sweet, because they
are indications of what is sweetest. What is the meaning of all that I have been saying? Why,
since the expression of your kindness which reached us in your letters, as a forerunner of
the treasures contained in you, with a goodly prelude brings the glad tidings of the blessing
which we expect at your hands, we both welcome the boon which those letters convey, like
some first-appearing flower of spring, and pray that we may soon enjoy in you the full beauty
of the season. For, be well assured, we have been deeply, deeply distressed by the passions
and spite of the people here, and their ways; and just as ice forms in cottages after the rains
that come in—for I will draw my comparison from the weather of our part of the
world2190,—and so moisture, when it gets in, if it spreads over the surface that is already
frozen, becomes congealed about the ice, and an addition is made to the mass already existing,
even so one may notice much the same kind of thing in the character of most of the people
in this neighbourhood, how they are always plotting and inventing something spiteful, and
a fresh mischief is congealed on the top of that which has been wrought before, and another
one on the top of that, and then again another, and this goes on without intermission, and
there is no limit to their hatred and to the increase of evils; so that we have great need of
many prayers that the grace of the Spirit may speedily breathe upon them, and thaw the
bitterness of their hatred, and melt the frost that is hardening upon them from their malice.
For this cause the spring, sweet as it is by nature, becomes yet more to be desired than ever
to those who after such storms look for you. Let not the boon, then, linger. Especially as our
great holiday2191 is approaching, it would be more reasonable that the land which bare you
should exult in her own treasures than that Pontus should in ours. Come then, dear one,
bringing us a multitude of blessings, even yourself; for this will fill up the measure of our
beatitude.</p>

<head>Letter X2192 .—To Libanius.</head>
<p>I once heard a medical man tell of a wonderful freak of nature. And this was his story.
A man was ill of an unmanageable complaint, and began to find fault with the medical faculty,
as being able to do far less than it professed; for everything that was devised for his cure was
ineffectual. Afterwards when some good news beyond his hopes was brought him, the occurrence
did the work of the healing art, by putting an end to his disease. Whether it were
that the soul by the overflowing sense of release from anxiety, and by a sudden rebound,
disposed the body to be in the same condition as itself, or in some other way, I cannot say:
for I have no leisure to enter upon such disquisitions, and the person who told me did not
specify the cause. But I have just called to mind the story very seasonably, as I think: for
when I was not as well as I could wish—now I need not tell you exactly the causes of all the
worries which befel me from the time I was with you to the present,—after some one told
me all at once of the letter which had arrived from your unparalleled Erudition, as soon as
I got the epistle and ran over what you had written, forthwith, first my soul was affected in
the same way as though I had been proclaimed before all the world as the hero of most
glorious achievements—so highly did I value the testimony which you favoured me with in
your letter,—and then also my bodily health immediately began to improve: and I afford
an example of the same marvel as the story which I told you just now, in that I was ill when
I read one half of the letter, and well when I read the other half of the same. Thus much for
those matters. But now, since Cynegius was the occasion of that favour, you are able, in the
overflowing abundance of your ability to do good, not only to benefit us, but also our benefactors;
and he is a benefactor of ours, as has been said before, by having been the cause and
occasion of our having a letter from you; and for this reason he well deserves both our good
offices. But if you ask who are our teachers,—if indeed we are thought to have learned anything,—
you will find that they are Paul and John, and the rest of the Apostles and Prophets;
if I do not seem to speak too boldly in claiming any knowledge of that art in which you so
excel, that competent judges declare2193 that the rules of oratory stream down from you, as
from an overflowing spring, upon all who have any pretensions to excellence in that depart-
<note type="footnote">2192 This and the following letter appear to have been written when Gregory still publicly professed belles

to Eunapius, Philosoph. Vit. p. 126) had become a Christian before the reign of Julian, and it is clear
that this Letter is written to a pagan. The Cod. Medic. has Libanius’ name as a title to both Letters. No Letter to

ment. This I have heard the admirable Basil say to everybody, Basil, who was your disciple,
but my father and teacher. But be assured, first, that I found no rich nourishment in the
precepts of my teachers2194, inasmuch as I enjoyed my brother’s society only for a short
time, and got only just enough polish from his diviner tongue to be able to discern the ignorance
of those who are uninitiated in oratory; next, however, that whenever I had leisure,
I devoted my time and energies to this study, and so became enamoured of your beauty,
though I never yet obtained the object of my passion. If, then, on the one side we never had
a teacher, which I deem to have been our case, and if on the other it is improper to suppose
that the opinion which you entertain of us is other than the true one—nay, you are correct
in your statement, and we are not quite contemptible in your judgment,—give me leave to
presume to attribute to you the cause of such proficiency as we may have attained. For if
Basil was the author of our oratory, and if his wealth came from your treasures, then what
we possess is yours, even though we received it through others. But if our attainments are
scanty, so is the water in a jar; still it comes from the Nile.</p>

<head>Letter XI.—To Libanius.</head>
<p>It was a custom with the Romans2195 to celebrate a feast in winter-time, after the custom
of their fathers, when the length of the days begins to draw out, as the sun climbs to the
upper regions of the sky. Now the beginning of the month is esteemed holy, and by this day
auguring the character of the whole year, they devote themselves to forecasting lucky accidents,
gladness, and wealth2196. What is my object in beginning my letter in this way? Why,
I do so because I too kept this feast, having got my present of gold as well as any of them;
for then there came into my hands as well as theirs gold, not like that vulgar gold, which
potentates treasure and which those that have it give,—that heavy, vile, and soulless possession,—
but that which is loftier than all wealth, as Pindar says2197, in the eyes of those that
have sense, being the fairest presentation, I mean your letter, and the vast wealth which it
contained. For thus it happened; that on that day, as I was going to the metropolis of the
Cappadocians, I met an acquaintance, who handed me this present, your letter, as a new
year’s gift. And I, being overjoyed at the occurrence, threw open my treasure to all who were
present; and all shared in it, each getting the whole of it, without any rivalry, and I was none
the worse off. For the letter by passing through the hands of all, like a ticket for a feast, is
the private wealth of each, some by steady continuous reading engraving the words upon
their memory, and others taking an impression2198 of them upon tablets; and it was again
in my hands, giving me more pleasure than the hard2199 metal does to the eyes of the rich.
Since, then, even to husbandmen—to use a homely comparison—approbation of the labours
which they have already accomplished is a strong stimulus to those which follow, bear with
us if we treat what you have yourself given as so much seed, and if we write that we may
provoke you to write back. But I beg of you a public and general boon for our life; that you
will no longer entertain the purpose which you expressed to us in a dark hint at the end of
your letter. For I do not think that it is at all a fair decision to come to, that,—because there
are some who disgrace themselves by deserting from the Greek language to the barbarian,
becoming mercenary soldiers and choosing a soldier’s rations instead of the renown of
eloquence,—you should therefore condemn oratory altogether, and sentence human life to
be as voiceless as that of beasts. For who is he who will open his lips, if you carry into effect
this severe sentence against oratory? But perhaps it will be well to remind you of a passage

of those who receive the benefit, so as to be eager to benefit only those who are sensible of
kindness, while we close our beneficence to the unthankful, but rather to imitate the Disposer
of all, Who distributes the good things of His creation alike to all, to the good and to the
evil. Having regard to this, admirable Sir, show yourself in your way of life such an one as
the time past has displayed you. For those who do not see the sun do not thereby hinder the

seized upon young men; and that he will devote himself of his own accord to the study of
rhetoric. But if he is otherwise disposed, it is only right, even if he be unwilling, he should

<head>Letter XII2200.—On his work against Eunomius.</head>
<p>We Cappadocians are poor in well-nigh all things that make the possessors of them
happy, but above all we are badly off for people who are able to write. This, be sure, is the
reason why I am so slow about sending you a letter: for, though my reply to the heresy (of
Eunomius) had been long ago completed, there was no one to transcribe it. Such a dearth
of writers it was that brought upon us the suspicion of sluggishness or of inability to frame
an answer. But since now at any rate, thank God, the writer and reviser have come, I have
sent this treatise to you; not, as Isocrates says2201, as a present, for I do not reckon it to be
such that it should be received in lieu of something of substantial value, but that it may be
in our power to cheer on those who are in the full vigour of youth to do battle with the enemy,
by stirring up the naturally sanguine temperament of early life. But if any portion of the
treatise should appear worthy of serious consideration, after examining some parts, especially
those prefatory to the “trials,”2202 and those which are of the same cast, and perhaps also
some of the doctrinal parts of the book, you will think them not ungratefully composed.
But to whatever conclusion you come, you will of course read them, as to a teacher and
corrector, to those who do not act like the players at ball2203, when they stand in three different
places and throw it from one to the other, aiming it exactly and catching one ball
from one and one from another, and they baffle the player who is in the middle, as he jumps
up to catch it, pretending that they are going to throw with a made-up expression of face,
and such and such a motion of the hand to left or right, and whichever way they see him
hurrying, they send the ball just the contrary way, and cheat his expectation by a trick. This
holds even now in the case of most of us, who, dropping all serious purpose, play at being
good-natured2204, as if at ball, with men, instead of realizing the favourable hope which we
hold out, beguiling to sinister2205 issues the souls of those who repose confidence in us.
Letters of reconciliation, caresses, tokens, presents, affectionate embrace by letters—these
are the making as if to throw with the ball to the right. But instead of the pleasure which

Gregory here speaks, without doubt, of his books against Eunomius: not of his Antirrhetic against Apollinaris,
which could have been transcribed in a very short time. Therefore we can place the date about 383, some months
after Gregory’s twelve Books against Eunomius, according to Hermantius, were published.</note>

from being good and true, but commit to God that judgeth righteously the suitable

<head>Letter XIII.—To the Church at Nicomedia2206.</head>
<p>May the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, Who disposeth all things in wisdom
for the best, visit you by His own grace, and comfort you by Himself, working in you
that which is well-pleasing to Him, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ come upon
you, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, that ye may have healing of all tribulation and
affliction, and advance towards all good, for the perfecting of the Church, for the edification
of your souls, and to the praise of the glory of His name. But in making here a defence of
ourselves before your charity, we would say that we were not neglectful to render an account
of the charge entrusted to us, either in time past, or since the departure hence of Patricius
of blessed memory; but we insist that there were many troubles in our Church, and the decay
of our bodily powers was great, increasing, as was natural, with advancing years; and great
also was the remissness of your Excellency towards us, inasmuch as no word ever came by
letter to induce us to undertake the task, nor was any connection kept up between your
Church and ourselves, although Euphrasius, your Bishop of blessed memory, had in all
holiness bound together our Humility to himself and to you with love, as with chains. But
even though the debt of love has not been satisfied before, either by our taking charge of
you, or your Piety’s encouragement of us, now at any rate we pray to God, taking your
prayer to God as an ally to our own desire, that we may with all speed possible visit you,
and be comforted along with you, and along with you show diligence, as the Lord may direct
us; so as to discover a means of rectifying the disorders which have already found place, and
of securing safety for the future, so that you may no longer be distracted by this discord,
one withdrawing himself from the Church in one direction, another in another, and be
thereby exposed as a laughing-stock to the Devil, whose desire and business it is (in direct
contrariety to the Divine will) that no one should be saved, or come to the knowledge of
the truth. For how do you think, brethren, that we were afflicted upon hearing from those
who reported to us your state, that there was no return to better things2207; but that the
<note type="footnote">2206 Euphrasius, mentioned in this Letter, had subscribed to the first Council of Constantinople, as Bishop
of Nicomedia. On his death, clergy and laity proceeded to a joint election of a successor. The date of this is uncertain;
Zacagni and Page think that the dispute here mentioned is to be identified with that which Sozomen
records, and which is placed by Baronius and Basnage in 400, 401. But we have no evidence that Gregory’s life
was prolonged so far.</note>

resolution of those who had once swerved aside is ever carried along in the same course;
and—as water from a conduit often overflows the neighbouring bank, and streaming off
sideways, flows away, and unless the leak is stopped, it is almost impossible to recall it to its
channel, when the submerged ground has been hollowed out in accordance with the course
of the stream,—even so the course of those who have left the Church, when it has once
through personal motives deflected from the straight and right faith, has sunk deep in the
rut of habit, and does not easily return to the grace it once had. For which cause your affairs
demand a wise and strong administrator, who is skilled to guide such wayward tempers
aright, so as to be able to recall to its pristine beauty the disorderly circuit of this stream,
that the corn-fields of your piety may once again flourish abundantly, watered by the irrigating
stream of peace. For this reason great diligence and fervent desire on the part of you
all is needed for this matter, that such an one may be appointed your President by the Holy
Spirit, who will have a single eye to the things of God alone, not turning his glance this way
or that to any of those things that men strive after. For for this cause I think that the ancient
law gave the Levite no share in the general inheritance of the land; that he might have God
alone for the portion of his possession, and might always be engaged about the possession
in himself, with no eye to any material object.</p>
<p><del>What follows is unintelligible, and something has probably been lost.</del></p>
<p>For it is not lawful that the simple should meddle with that with which they have no
concern, but which properly belongs to others. For you should each mind your own business,
that so that which is most expedient may come about [and that your Church may again
prosper], when those who have been dispersed have returned again to the unit of the one
body, and spiritual peace is established by those who devoutly glorify God. To this end it is
well, I think, to look out for high qualifications in your election, that he who is appointed
to the Presidency may be suitable for the post. Now the Apostolic injunctions do not direct
us to look to high birth, wealth, and distinction in the eyes of the world among the virtues
of a Bishop; but if all this should, unsought, accompany your spiritual chiefs, we do not reject
it, but consider it merely as a shadow accidentally2208 following the body; and none the less
shall we welcome the more precious endowments, even though they happen to be apart
from those boons of fortune. The prophet Amos was a goat-herd; Peter was a fisherman,
and his brother Andrew followed the same employment; so too was the sublime John; Paul
was a tent-maker, Matthew a publican, and the rest of the Apostles in the same way—not
consuls, generals, prefects, or distinguished in rhetoric and philosophy, but poor, and of
none of the learned professions, but starting from the more humble occupations of life: and
yet for all that their voice went out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the

world. “Consider your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty,
not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world2209.” Perhaps
even now it is thought something foolish, as things appear to men, when one is not able to
do much from poverty, or is slighted because of meanness of extraction2210, not of character.
But who knows whether the horn of anointing is not poured out by grace upon such an one,
even though he be less than the lofty and more illustrious? Which was more to the interest
of the Church at Rome, that it should at its commencement be presided over by some highborn
and pompous senator, or by the fisherman Peter, who had none of this world’s advantages
to attract men to him2211? What house had he, what slaves, what property ministering
luxury, by wealth constantly flowing in? But that stranger, without a table, without a roof
over his head, was richer than those who have all things, because through having nothing
he had God wholly. So too the people of Mesopotamia, though they had among them wealthy
satraps, preferred Thomas above them all to the presidency of their Church; the Cretans
preferred Titus, the dwellers at Jerusalem James, and we Cappadocians the centurion, who
at the Cross acknowledged the Godhead of the Lord, though there were many at that time
of splendid lineage, whose fortunes enabled them to maintain a stud, and who prided
themselves upon having the first place in the Senate. And in all the Church one may see
those who are great according to God’s standard preferred above worldly magnificence.
You too, I think, ought to have an eye to these spiritual qualifications at this time present,
if you really mean to revive the ancient glory of your Church. For nothing is better known
to you than your own history, that anciently, before the city near you2212 flourished, the
seat of government was with you, and among Bithynian cities there was nothing preeminent
above yours. And now, it is true, the public buildings that once graced it have disappeared,
but the city that consists in men—whether we look to numbers or to quality—is rapidly
rising to a level with its former splendour. Accordingly it would well become you to entertain
thoughts that shall not fall below the height of the blessings that now are yours, but to raise
your enthusiasm in the work before you to the height of the magnificence of your city, that
you may find such a one to preside over the laity as will prove himself not unworthy of

you2213. For it is disgraceful, brethren, and utterly monstrous, that while no one ever becomes
a pilot unless he is skilled in navigation, he who sits at the helm of the Church should not
know how to bring the souls of those who sail with him safe into the haven of God. How
many wrecks of Churches, men and all, have ere now taken place by the inexperience of
their heads! Who can reckon what disasters might not have been avoided, had there been
aught of the pilot’s skill in those who had command? Nay, we entrust iron, to make vessels
with, not to those who know nothing about the matter, but to those who are acquainted
with the art of the smith; ought we not therefore to trust souls to him who is well-skilled to
soften them by the fervent heat of the Holy Spirit, and who by the impress of rational implements
may fashion each one of you to be a chosen and useful vessel? It is thus that the inspired
Apostle bids us to take thought, in his Epistle to Timothy2214, laying injunction upon
all who hear, when he says that a Bishop must be without reproach. Is this all that the Apostle
cares for, that he who is advanced to the priesthood should be irreproachable? and what is
so great an advantage as that all possible qualifications should be included in one? But he
knows full well that the subject is moulded by the character of his superior, and that the
upright walk of the guide becomes that of his followers too. For what the Master is, such
does he make the disciple to be. For it is impossible that he who has been apprenticed to
the art of the smith should practise that of the weaver, or that one who has only been taught
to work at the loom should turn out an orator or a mathematician: but on the contrary that
which the disciple sees in his master he adopts and transfers to himself. For this reason it is
that the Scripture says, “Every disciple that is perfect shall be as his master2215.” What then,
brethren? Is it possible to be lowly and subdued in character, moderate, superior to the love
of lucre, wise in things divine, and trained to virtue and considerateness in works and ways,
without seeing those qualities in one’s master? Nay, I do not know how a man can become
spiritual, if he has been a disciple in a worldly school. For how can they who are striving to
resemble their master fail to be like him? What advantage is the magnificence of the aqueduct
to the thirsty, if there is no water in it, even though the symmetrical disposition of
columns2216 variously shaped rear aloft the pediment2217? Which would the thirsty man
rather choose for the supply of his own need, to see marbles beautifully disposed or to find
good spring water, even if it flowed through a wooden pipe, as long as the stream which it
poured forth was clear and drinkable? Even so, brethren, those who look to godliness should

more than with a dry aqueduct, if he display not in his life the primary and essential qualities

garden of delight having been opened and the water of the fountain having been unstopped,

soon be found among you such an one, who shall be a chosen vessel, a pillar of the Church.

<head>Letter XIV2221.—To the Bishop of Melitene.</head>
<p>How beautiful are the likenesses of beautiful objects, when they preserve in all its
clearness the impress of the original beauty! For of your soul, so truly beautiful, I saw a most
clear image in the sweetness of your letter, which, as the Gospel says, “out of the abundance
of the heart” you filled with honey. And for this reason I fancied I saw you in person, and
enjoyed your cheering company, from the affection expressed in your letter; and often taking
your letter into my hands and going over it again from beginning to end, I only came more
vehemently to crave for the enjoyment, and there was no sense of satiety. Such a feeling can
no more put an end to my pleasure, than it can to that derived from anything that is by
nature beautiful and precious. For neither has our constant participation of the benefit
blunted the edge of our longing to behold the sun, nor does the unbroken enjoyment of
health prevent our desiring its continuance; and we are persuaded that it is equally impossible
for our enjoyment of your goodness, which we have often experienced face to face and now
by letter, ever to reach the point of satiety. But our case is like that of those who from some
circumstance are afflicted with unquenchable thirst; for just in the same way, the more we
taste your kindness, the more thirsty we become. But unless you suppose our language to
be mere blandishment and unreal flattery—and assuredly you will not so suppose, being
what you are in all else, and to us especially good and staunch, if any one ever was,—you
will certainly believe what I say; that the favour of your letter, applied to my eyes like some
medical prescription, stayed my ever-flowing “fountain of tears,” and that fixing our hopes
on the medicine of your holy prayers, we expect that soon and completely the disease of our
soul will be healed: though, for the present at any rate, we are in such a case, that we spare
the ears of one who is fond of us, and bury the truth in silence, that we may not drag those
who loyally love us into partnership with our troubles. For when we consider that, bereft
of what is dearest to us, we are involved in wars, and that it is our children that we were
compelled to leave behind, our children whom we were counted worthy to bear to God in
spiritual pangs, closely joined to us by the law of love, who at the time of their own trials
amid their afflictions extended their affection to us; and over and above these, a fondlyloved2222
home, brethren, kinsmen, companions, intimate associates, friends, hearth, table,
cellar, bed, seat, sack, converse, tears—and how sweet these are, and how dearly prized from
long habit, I need not write to you who know full well—but not to weary you further, consider

for yourself what I have in exchange for those blessings. Now that I am at the end of my life,
I begin to live again, and am compelled to learn the graceful versatility of character which
is now in vogue: but we are late learners in the shifty school of knavery;2223 so that we are
constantly constrained to blush at our awkwardness and inaptitude for this new study. But
our adversaries, equipped with all the training of this wisdom, are well able to keep what
they have learned, and to invent what they have not learned. Their method of warfare accordingly
is to skirmish at a distance, and then at a preconcerted signal to form their phalanx
in solid order; they utter by way of prelude2224 whatever suits their interests, they execute
surprises by means of exaggerations, they surround themselves with allies from every quarter.
But a vast amount of cunning invincible in power2225 accompanies them, advanced before
them to lead their host, like some right-and-left-handed combatant, fighting with both
hands in front of his army, on one side levying tribute upon his subjects, on the other
smiting those who come in his way. But if you care to inquire into the state of our internal
affairs, you will find other troubles to match; a stifling hut, abundant in cold, gloom, confinement,
and all such advantages; a life the mark of every one’s censorious observation, the
voice, the look, the way of wearing one’s cloak, the movement of the hands, the position of
one’s feet, and everything else, all a subject for busy-bodies. And unless one from time to
time emits a deep breathing, and unless a continuous groaning is uttered with the breathing,
and unless the tunic passes gracefully through the girdle (not to mention the very disuse of
the girdle itself), and unless our cloak flows aslant down our backs—the omission of anyone
of these niceties is a pretext for war against us. And on such grounds as these, they gather
together to battle against us, man by man2226, township by township, even down to all sorts
of out-of-the-way places. Well, one cannot be always faring well or always ill, for every one’s

He moved from place to place to strengthen the Catholic cause; “we,” he says in the longer Antirrhetic, “who

places, and have also observed many things by means of verbal description in the accounts
of old writers, think both all I have seen, and all of which I have heard, of no account in
comparison with the loveliness that is to be found here. Your Helicon is nothing: the Islands
of the Blest are a fable: the Sicyonian plain is a trifle: the accounts of the Peneus are another
case of poetic exaggeration—that river which they say by overflowing with its rich current
the banks which flank its course makes for the Thessalians their far-famed Tempe. Why,
what beauty is there in any one of these places I have mentioned, such as Vanota can show
us of its own? For if one seeks for natural beauty in the place, it needs none of the adornments
of art: and if one considers what has been done for it by artificial aid, there has been so much
done, and that so well, as might overcome even natural disadvantages. The gifts bestowed
upon the spot by Nature who beautifies the earth with unstudied grace are such as these:
below, the river Halys makes the place fair to look upon with his banks, and gleams like a
golden ribbon through their deep purple, reddening his current with the soil he washes
down. Above, a mountain densely overgrown with wood stretches with its long ridge, covered
at all points with the foliage of oaks, worthy of finding some Homer to sing its praises more
than that Ithacan Neritus, which the poet calls “far-seen with quivering leaves2228.” But the
natural growth of wood, as it comes down the hill-side, meets at the foot the planting of
men’s husbandry. For forthwith vines, spread out over the slopes, and swellings, and hollows
at the mountain’s base, cover with their colour, like a green mantle, all the lower ground:
and the season at this time even added to their beauty, displaying its grape-clusters wonderful
to behold. Indeed this caused me yet more surprise, that while the neighbouring country
shows fruit still unripe, one might here enjoy the full clusters, and be sated with their perfection.
Then, far off, like a watch-fire from some great beacon, there shone before our eyes
the fair beauty of the buildings. On the left as we entered was the chapel built for the martyrs,
not yet complete in its structure, but still lacking the roof, yet making a good show notwithstanding.
Straight before us in the way were the beauties of the house, where one part is
marked out from another by some delicate invention. There were projecting towers, and
preparations for banqueting among the wide and high-arched rows of trees crowning the

<pb n="1016"/>
entrance before the gates2229. Then about the buildings are the Phaeacian gardens; rather,
let not the beauties of Vanota be insulted by comparison with those. Homer never saw “the
apple with bright fruit2230” as we have it here, approaching to the hue of its own blossom
in the exceeding brilliancy of its colouring: he never saw the pear whiter than new-polished
ivory. And what can one say of the varieties of the peach, diverse and multiform, yet blended
and compounded out of different species? For just as with those who paint “goat-stags,”
and “centaurs,” and the like, commingling things of different kind, and making themselves
wiser than Nature, so it is in the case of this fruit: Nature, under the despotism of art, turns
one to an almond, another to a walnut, yet another to a “Doracinus2231,” mingled alike in
name and in flavour. And in all these the number of single trees is more noted than their
beauty; yet they display tasteful arrangement in their planting, and that harmonious form
of drawing—drawing, I call it, for the marvel belongs rather to the painter’s art than to the
gardener’s. So readily does Nature fall in with the design of those who arrange these devices,
that it seems impossible to express this by words. Who could find words worthily to describe
the road under the climbing vines, and the sweet shade of their cluster, and that novel wallstructure
where roses with their shoots, and vines with their trailers, twist themselves together
and make a fortification that serves as a wall against a flank attack, and the pond at the
summit of this path, and the fish that are bred there? As regards all these, the people who
have charge of your Nobility’s house were ready to act as our guides with a certain ingenuous
kindliness, and pointed them out to us, showing us each of the things you had taken pains
about, as if it were yourself to whom, by our means, they were showing courtesy. There too,
one of the lads, like a conjuror, showed us such a wonder as one does not very often find in
nature: for he went down to the deep water and brought up at will such of the fish as he selected;
and they seemed no strangers to the fisherman’s touch, being tame and submissive
under the artist’s hands, like well-trained dogs. Then they led me to a house as if to rest—a
house, I call it, for such the entrance betokened, but, when we came inside, it was not a
house but a portico which received us. The portico was raised up aloft to a great height over
a deep pool: the basement supporting the portico of triangular shape, like a gateway leading
to the delights within, was washed by the water. Straight before us in the interior a sort of
house occupied the vertex of the triangle, with lofty roof, lit on all sides by the sun’s rays,
and decked with varied paintings; so that this spot almost made us forget what had preceded
it. The house attracted us to itself; and again, the portico on the pool was a unique sight.

For the excellent fish would swim up from the depths to the surface, leaping up into the
very air like winged things, as though purposely mocking us creatures of the dry land. For
showing half their form and tumbling through the air, they plunged once more into the
depth. Others, again, in shoals, following one another in order, were a sight for unaccustomed
eyes: while in another place one might see another shoal packed in a cluster round a morsel
of bread, pushed aside one by another, and here one leaping up, there another diving
downwards. But even this we were made to forget by the grapes that were brought us in
baskets of twisted shoots, by the varied bounty of the season’s fruit, the preparation for
breakfast, the varied dainties, and savoury dishes, and sweetmeats, and drinking of healths,
and wine-cups. So now since I was sated and inclined to sleep, I got a scribe posted beside
me, and sent to your Eloquence, as if it were a dream, this chattering letter. But I hope to
recount in full to yourself and your friends, not with paper and ink, but with my own voice
and tongue, the beauties of your home.</p>

<head>Letter XVI.—To Amphilochius.</head>
<p>I am well persuaded that by God’s grace the business of the Church of the Martyrs is in
a fair way. Would that you were willing in the matter. The task we have in hand will find
its end by the power of God, Who is able, wherever He speaks, to turn word into deed.
Seeing that, as the Apostle says, “He Who has begun a good work will also perform it2232”,
I would exhort you in this also to be an imitator of the great Paul, and to advance our hope
to actual fulfilment, and send us so many workmen as may suffice for the work we have in
hand.</p>
<p>Your Perfection might perhaps be informed by calculation of the dimensions to which
the total work will attain: and to this end I will endeavour to explain the whole structure by
a verbal description. The form of the chapel is a cross, which has its figure completed
throughout, as you would expect, by four structures. The junctions of the buildings intercept
one another, as we see everywhere in the cruciform pattern. But within the cross there lies
a circle, divided by eight angles (I call the octagonal figure a circle in view of its circumference),
in such wise that the two pairs of sides of the octagon which are diametrically opposed
to one another, unite by means of arches the central circle to the adjoining blocks of building;
while the other four sides of the octagon, which lie between the quadrilateral buildings, will
not themselves be carried to meet the buildings, but upon each of them will be described a
semicircle like a shell2233, terminating in an arch above: so that the arches will be eight in
all, and by their means the quadrilateral and semicircular buildings will be connected, side
by side, with the central structure. In the blocks of masonry formed by the angles there will
be an equal number of pillars, at once for ornament and for strength, and these again will
carry arches built of equal size to correspond with those within2234. And above these eight
arches, with the symmetry of an upper range of windows, the octagonal building will be
raised to the height of four cubits: the part rising from it will be a cone shaped like a top, as
the vaulting2235 narrows the figure of the roof from its full width to a pointed wedge. The
dimensions below will be,—the width of each of the quadrilateral buildings, eight cubits,
the length of them half as much again, the height as much as the proportion of the width
<note type="footnote">2232 Cf. Phil. i. 6</note>
<note type="footnote">2233 Reading κογχοειδῶς</note>
<note type="footnote">2234 That is, on an inner line; the upper row having their supports at the angles of the inscribed octagon, and
therefore at a point further removed from the centre of the circle than those of the lower tier, which correspond
to the sides of the octagon. Or, simply, “those inside the building,” the upper tier showing in the outside view
of the structure, while the lower row would only be visible from the interior. There is apparently a corresponding
row of windows above the upper row of arches, carrying the central tower four cubits higher. This at least seems
the sense of the clause immediately following.</note>
<note type="footnote">2235 Reading εἰλησέως, of which this seems to be the meaning.</note>

<pb n="1019"/>
allows. It will be as much in the semicircles also. The whole length between the piers extends
in the same way to eight cubits, and the depth will be as much as will be given by the sweep
of the compasses with the fixed point placed in the middle of the side2236 and extending to
the end. The height will be determined in this case too by the proportion to the width. And
the thickness of the wall, an interval of three feet from inside these spaces, which are measured
internally, will run round the whole building.</p>
<p>I have troubled your Excellency with this serious trifling, with this intention, that by
the thickness of the walls, and by the intermediate spaces, you may accurately ascertain what
sum the number of feet gives as the measurement; because your intellect is exceedingly
quick in all matters, and makes its way, by God’s grace, in whatever subject you will, and it
is possible for you, by subtle calculation, to ascertain the sum made up by all the parts, so
as to send us masons neither more nor fewer than our need requires. And I beg you to direct
your attention specially to this point, that some of them may be skilled in making vaulting2237
without supports: for I am informed that when built in this way it is more durable than what
is made to rest on props. It is the scarcity of wood that brings us to this device of roofing
the whole fabric with stone; because the place supplies no timber for roofing. Let your unerring
mind be persuaded, because some of the people here contract with me to furnish
thirty workmen for a stater, for the dressed stonework, of course with a specified ration
along with the stater. But the material of our masonry is not of this sort2238, but brick made
of clay and chance stones, so that they do not need to spend time in fitting the faces of the
stones accurately together. I know that so far as skill and fairness in the matter of wages are
concerned, the workmen in your neighbourhood are better for our purpose than those who
follow the trade here. The sculptor’s work lies not only in the eight pillars, which must
themselves be improved and beautified, but the work requires altar-like base-mouldings2239,
and capitals carved in the Corinthian style. The porch, too, will be of marbles wrought with
appropriate ornaments. The doors set upon these will be adorned with some such designs
as are usually employed by way of embellishment at the projection of the cornice. Of all
these, of course, we shall furnish the materials; the form to be impressed on the materials
art will bestow. Besides these there will be in the colonnade not less than forty pillars: these
also will be of wrought stone. Now if my account has explained the work in detail, I hope
it may be possible for your Sanctity, on perceiving what is needed, to relieve us completely
from anxiety so far as the workmen are concerned. If, however, the workman were inclined
to make a bargain favourable to us, let a distinct measure of work, if possible, be fixed for

the day, so that he may not pass his time doing nothing, and then, though he has no work
to show for it, as having worked for us so many days, demand payment for them. I know
that we shall appear to most people to be higglers, in being so particular about the contracts.
But I beg you to pardon me; for that Mammon about whom I have so often said such hard
things, has at last departed from me as far as he can possibly go, being disgusted, I suppose,
at the nonsense that is constantly talked against him, and has fortified himself against me
by an impassable gulf—to wit, poverty—so that neither can he come to me, nor can I pass
to him2240. This is why I make a point of the fairness of the workmen, to the end that we
may be able to fulfil the task before us, and not be hindered by poverty—that laudable and
desirable evil. Well, in all this there is a certain admixture of jest. But do you, man of God,
in such ways as are possible and legitimate, boldly promise in bargaining with the men that
they will all meet with fair treatment at our hands, and full payment of their wages: for we
shall give all and keep back nothing, as God also opens to us, by your prayers, His hand of
blessing.</p>

<head>Letter XVII.—To Eustathia, Ambrosia, and Basilissa2241. To the most discreet and devout
Sisters, Eustathia and Ambrosia, and to the most discreet and noble Daughter, Basilissa,
Gregory sends greeting in the Lord.</head>
<p>The meeting with the good and the beloved, and the memorials of the immense love of
the Lord for us men, which are shown in your localities, have been the source to me of the
most intense joy and gladness. Doubly indeed have these shone upon divinely festal days;
both in beholding the saving tokens2242 of the God who gave us life, and in meeting with
souls in whom the tokens of the Lord’s grace are to be discerned spiritually in such clearness,
that one can believe that Bethlehem and Golgotha, and Olivet, and the scene of the Resurrection
are really in the God-containing heart. For when through a good conscience Christ
has been formed in any, when any has by dint of godly fear nailed down the promptings of
the flesh and become crucified to Christ, when any has rolled away from himself the heavy
stone of this world’s illusions, and coming forth from the grave of the body has begun to
walk as it were in a newness of life, abandoning this low-lying valley of human life, and
mounting with a soaring desire to that heavenly country2243 with all its elevated thoughts,
where Christ is, no longer feeling the body’s burden, but lifting it by chastity, so that the
flesh with cloud-like lightness accompanies the ascending soul—such an one, in my opinion,
is to be counted in the number of those famous ones in whom the memorials of the Lord’s
love for us men are to be seen. When, then, I not only saw with the sense of sight those
Sacred Places, but I saw the tokens of places like them, plain in yourselves as well, I was
filled with joy so great that the description of its blessing is beyond the power of utterance.
But because it is a difficult, not to say an impossible thing for a human being to enjoy unmixed
with evil any blessing, therefore something of bitterness was mingled with the sweets
I tasted: and by this, after the enjoyment of those blessings, I was saddened in my journey

back to my native land, estimating now the truth of the Lord’s words, that “the whole world
lieth in wickedness2244,” so that no single part of the inhabited earth is without its share of
degeneracy. For if the spot itself that has received the footprints of the very Life is not clear
of the wicked thorns, what are we to think of other places where communion with the
Blessing has been inculcated by hearing and preaching alone2245. With what view I say this,
need not be explained more fully in words; facts themselves proclaim more loudly than any
speech, however intelligible, the melancholy truth.</p>
<p>The Lawgiver of our life has enjoined upon us one single hatred. I mean, that of the
Serpent: for no other purpose has He bidden us exercise this faculty of hatred, but as a resource
against wickedness. “I will put enmity,” He says, “between thee and him.” Since
wickedness is a complicated and multifarious thing, the Word allegorizes it by the Serpent,
the dense array of whose scales is symbolic of this multiformity of evil. And we by working
the will of our Adversary make an alliance with this serpent, and so turn this hatred against
one another2246, and perhaps not against ourselves alone, but against Him Who gave the
commandment; for He says, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy,” commanding
us to hold the foe to our humanity as our only enemy, and declaring that all who
share that humanity are the neighbours of each one of us. But this gross-hearted age has
disunited us from our neighbour, and has made us welcome the serpent, and revel in his
spotted scales2247. I affirm, then, that it is a lawful thing to hate God’s enemies, and that
this kind of hatred is pleasing to our Lord: and by God’s enemies I mean those who deny
the glory of our Lord, be they Jews, or downright idolaters, or those who through Arius’
teaching idolize the creature, and so adopt the error of the Jews. Now when the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, are with orthodox devotion being glorified and adored by those
who believe that in a distinct and unconfused Trinity there is One Substance, Glory, Kingship,
Power, and Universal Rule, in such a case as this what good excuse for fighting can there
be? At the time, certainly, when the heretical views prevailed, to try issues with the authorities,
by whom the adversaries’ cause was seen to be strengthened, was well; there was fear
then lest our saving Doctrine should be over-ruled by human rulers. But now, when over
the whole world from one end of heaven to the other the orthodox Faith is being preached,
the man who fights with them who preach it, fights not with them, but with Him Who is
thus preached. What other aim, indeed, ought that man’s to be, who has the zeal for God,
than in every possible way to announce the glory of God? As long, then, as the Only-begotten

is adored with all the heart and soul and mind, believed to be in everything that which the
Father is, and in like manner the Holy Ghost is glorified with an equal amount of adoration,
what plausible excuse for fighting is left these over-refined disputants, who are rending the
seamless robe, and parting the Lord’s name between Paul and Cephas, and undisguisedly
abhorring contact with those who worship Christ, all but exclaiming in so many words,
“Away from me, I am holy”?</p>
<p>Granting that the knowledge which they believe themselves to have acquired is somewhat
greater than that of others: yet can they possess more than the belief that the Son of the Very
God is Very God, seeing that in that article of the Very God every idea that is orthodox,
every idea that is our salvation, is included? It includes the idea of His Goodness, His Justice,
His Omnipotence: that He admits of no variableness nor alteration, but is always the same;
incapable of changing to worse or changing to better, because the first is not His nature, the
second He does not admit of; for what can be higher than the Highest, what can be better
than the Best? In fact, He is thus associated with all perfection, and, as to every form of alteration,
is unalterable; He did not on occasions display this attribute, but was always so,
both before the Dispensation that made Him man, and during it, and after it; and in all His
activities in our behalf He never lowered any part of that changeless and unvarying character
to that which was out of keeping with it. What is essentially imperishable and changeless is
always such; it does not follow the variation of a lower order of things, when it comes by
dispensation to be there; just as the sun, for example, when he plunges his beam into the
gloom, does not dim the brightness of that beam; but instead, the dark is changed by the
beam into light; thus also the True Light, shining in our gloom, was not itself overshadowed
with that shade, but enlightened it by means of itself. Well, seeing that our humanity was
in darkness, as it is written, “They know not, neither will they understand, they walk on in
darkness2248,” the Illuminator of this darkened world darted the beam of His Divinity
through the whole compound of our nature, through soul, I say, and body too, and so appropriated
humanity entire by means of His own light, and took it up and made it just that
thing which He is Himself. And as this Divinity was not made perishable, though it inhabited
a perishable body, so neither did it alter in the direction of any change, though it healed the
changeful in our soul: in medicine, too, the physician of the body, when he takes hold of his
patient, so far from himself contracting the disease, thereby perfects the cure of the suffering
part. Let no one, either, putting a wrong interpretation on the words of the Gospel, suppose
that our human nature in Christ was transformed to something more divine by any gradations
and advance: for the increasing in stature and in wisdom and in favour, is recorded in Holy
Writ only to prove that Christ really was present in the human compound, and so to leave
no room for their surmise, who propound that a phantom, or form in human outline, and
<note type="footnote">2248 Ps. lxxxii. 5.</note>

<pb n="1024"/>
not a real Divine Manifestation, was there. It is for this reason that Holy Writ records unabashed
with regard to Him all the accidents of our nature, even eating, drinking, sleeping,
weariness, nurture, increase in bodily stature, growing up—everything that marks humanity,
except the tendency to sin. Sin, indeed, is a miscarriage, not a quality of human nature: just
as disease and deformity are not congenital to it in the first instance, but are its unnatural
accretions, so activity in the direction of sin is to be thought of as a mere mutilation of the
goodness innate in us; it is not found to be itself a real thing, but we see it only in the absence
of that goodness. Therefore He Who transformed the elements of our nature into His divine
abilities, rendered it secure from mutilation and disease, because He admitted not in Himself
the deformity which sin works in the will. “He did no sin,” it says, “neither was guile found
in his mouth2249.” And this in Him is not to be regarded in connection with any interval
of time: for at once the man in Mary (where Wisdom built her house), though naturally
part of our sensuous compound, along with the coming upon her of the Holy Ghost, and
her overshadowing with the power of the Highest, became that which that overshadowing
power in essence was: for, without controversy, it is the Less that is blest by the Greater.
Seeing, then, that the power of the Godhead is an immense and immeasurable thing, while
man is a weak atom, at the moment when the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, and the
power of the Highest overshadowed her, the tabernacle formed by such an impulse was not
clothed with anything of human corruption; but, just as it was first constituted, so it remained,
even though it was man, Spirit nevertheless, and Grace, and Power; and the special attributes
of our humanity derived lustre from this abundance of Divine Power2250.</p>
<p>There are indeed two limits of human life: the one we start from, and the one we end
in: and so it was necessary that the Physician of our being should enfold us at both these
extremities, and grasp not only the end, but the beginning too, in order to secure in both
the raising of the sufferer. That, then, which we find to have happened on the side of the
finish we conclude also as to the beginning. As at the end He caused by virtue of the Incarnation
that, though the body was disunited from the soul, yet the indivisible Godhead which
<note type="footnote">2249 1 Pet. ii. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">2250 Compare Gregory against Apollinaris (Ad Theophil. iii. 265): “The first-fruits of humanity assumed by
omnipotent Deity were, like a drop of vinegar merged in a boundless ocean, found still in that Deity, but not in
their own distinctive properties: otherwise we should be obliged to think of a duality of Sons.” In Orat. Cat. c.
10, he says that the Divine nature is to be conceived as having been so united with the human, as flame is with
its fuel, the former extending beyond the latter, as our souls also overstep the limits of our bodies. The first of
these passages appeared to Hooker (V. liii. 2) to be “so plain and direct for Eutyches,” that he doubted whether
the words were Gregory’s. But at the Council of Ephesus, S. Cyril (of Alexandria), in his contest with the
Nestorians, had showed that these expressions were capable of a Catholic interpretation, and pardonable in
discussing the difficult and mysterious question of the union of the Two Natures.</note>

had been blended once for all with the subject (who possessed them) was not stripped from
that body any more than it was from that soul, but while it was in Paradise along with the
soul, and paved an entrance there in the person of the Thief for all humanity, it remained
by means of the body in the heart of the earth, and therein destroyed him that had the power
of Death (wherefore His body too is called “the Lord2251” on account of that inherent
Godhead)—so also, at the beginning, we conclude that the power of the Highest, coalescing
with our entire nature by that coming upon (the Virgin) of the Holy Ghost, both resides in
our soul, so far as reason sees it possible that it should reside there, and is blended with our
body, so that our salvation throughout every element may be perfect, that heavenly passionlessness
which is peculiar to the Deity being nevertheless preserved both in the beginning
and in the end of this life as Man2252. Thus the beginning was not as our beginning, nor the
end as our end. Both in the one and in the other He evinced His Divine independence; the
beginning had no stain of pleasure upon it, the end was not the end in dissolution.</p>
<p>Now if we loudly preach all this, and testify to all this, namely that Christ is the power
of God and the wisdom of God, always changeless, always imperishable, though He comes
in the changeable and the perishable; never stained Himself, but making clean that which
is stained; what is the crime that we commit, and wherefore are we hated? And what means
this opposing array2253 of new Altars? Do we announce another Jesus? Do we hint at another?
Do we produce other scriptures? Have any of ourselves dared to say “Mother of Man” of
the Holy Virgin, the Mother of God2254: which is what we hear that some of them say without

more brilliant material? What charge like these can be brought against us, that our company
should be reckoned a thing to be avoided, and that in some places another altar should be
erected in opposition to us, as if we should defile their sanctuaries? My heart was in a state
of burning indignation about this: and now that I have set foot in the City2256 again, I am
eager to unburden my soul of its bitterness, by appealing, in a letter, to your love. Do ye,
whithersoever the Holy Spirit shall lead you, there remain; walk with God before you; confer
not with flesh and blood; lend no occasion to any of them for glorying, that they may not
glory in you, enlarging their ambition by anything in your lives. Remember the Holy Fathers,
into whose hands ye were commended by your Father now in bliss2257, and to whom we
by God’s grace were deemed worthy to succeed and remove not the boundaries which our
Fathers have laid down, nor put aside in any way the plainness of our simpler proclamation
in favour of their subtler school. Walk by the primitive rule of the Faith: and the God of
peace shall be with you, and ye shall be strong in mind and body. May God keep you uncorrupted,

spreading in the convents at Jerusalem. The factious purism, however, which Gregory deplores here, and which
led to rival altars, seems to have evinced itself amongst the orthodox themselves, “quo majorem apud omnes
opinionem de suâ præstantiâ belli isti cathari excitarent” (Casaubon). Cyril, it is true, had returned this year,
382; and spent the last years of his life in his see; but with more than twenty years interval of Arian rule (Herennius,
Heraclius, and Hilarius, according to Sozomen) the communities of the Catholics must have suffered from
want of a constant control: and unity was always difficult to maintain in a city frequented by all the ecclesiastics
of the world. Gregory must have “succeeded” to this charge in his visit to Jerusalem after the Council of Antioch
in 379, to which he refers in his letter On Pilgrimages: but it is possible that he had paid even an earlier visit: see

<head>Letter XVIII.—To Flavian2258.</head>
<p>Things with us, O man of God, are not in a good way. The development of the bad
feeling existing amongst certain persons who have conceived a most groundless and unaccountable
hatred of us is no longer a matter of mere conjecture; it is now evinced with an
earnestness and openness worthy only of some holy work. You meanwhile, who have hitherto
been beyond the reach of such annoyance, are too remiss in stifling the devouring conflagration
on your neighbour’s land; yet those who are well-advised for their own interests really
do take pains to check a fire close to them, securing themselves, by this help given to a
neighbour, against ever needing help in like circumstances. Well, you will ask, what do I
complain of? Piety has vanished from the world; Truth has fled from our midst; as for Peace,
we used to have the name at all events going the round upon men’s lips; but now not only
does she herself cease to exist, but we do not even retain the word that expresses her. But
that you may know more exactly the things that move our indignation, I will briefly detail
to you the whole tragic story.</p>
<p>Certain persons had informed me that the Right Reverend Helladius had unfriendly
feelings towards me, and that he enlarged in conversation to every one upon the troubles
that I had brought upon him. I did not at first believe what they said, judging only from
myself, and the actual truth of the matter. But when every one kept bringing to us a tale of
the same strain, and facts besides corroborated their report, I thought it my duty not to
continue to overlook this ill-feeling, while it was still without root and development. I
therefore wrote by letter to your piety, and to many others who could help me in my intention,
and stimulated your zeal in this matter. At last, after I had concluded the services at
Sebasteia in2259 commemoration of Peter2260 of most blessed memory, and of the holy
martyrs, who had lived in his times, and whom the people were accustomed to commemorate
with him, I was returning to my own See, when some one told me that Helladius himself
was in the neighbouring mountain district, holding martyrs’ memorial services. At first I
held on my journey, judging it more proper that our meeting should take place in the met-
<note type="footnote">2258 The date of this letter is probably as late as 393. Flavian’s authority at Antioch was now undisputed, by
his reconciliation, after the deaths of Paulinus and Evagrius, with the Bishops of Alexandria and Rome, and,
through them, with all his people. Gregory writes to him not only as his dear friend, but one who had known
how to appease wrath, and to check opposition from the Emperor downward. He died in 404. The litigiousness
of Helladius is described by Greg. Naz., Letter ccxv. He it was who a few years later, against Ambrose’s authority,
and for mere private interest, consecrated the physician Gerontius (Sozomen, viii. 6).</note>

ropolis itself. But when one of his relations took the trouble to meet me, and to assure me
that he was sick, I left my carriage at the spot where this news arrested me; I performed on
horseback the intervening journey over a road that was like a precipice, and well-nigh impassable
with its rocky ascents. Fifteen milestones measured the distance we had to traverse.
Painfully travelling, now on foot, now mounted, in the early morning, and even employing
some part of the night, I arrived between twelve and one o’clock at Andumocina; for that
was the name of the place where, with two other bishops, he was holding his conference.
From a shoulder of the hill overhanging this village, we looked down, while still at a distance,
upon this outdoor assemblage of the Church. Slowly, and on foot, and leading the horses,
I and my company passed over the intervening ground, and we arrived at the chapel2261
just as he had retired to his residence.</p>
<p>Without any delay a messenger was despatched to inform him of our being there; and
a very short while after, the deacon in attendance on him met us, and we requested him to
tell Helladius at once, so that we might spend as much time as possible with him, and so
have an opportunity of leaving nothing in the misunderstanding between us unhealed. As
for myself, I then remained sitting, still in the open air, and waited for the invitation indoors;
and at a most inopportune time I became, as I sat there, a gazing stock to all the visitors at
the conference. The time was long; drowsiness came on, and languor, intensified by the fatigue
of the journey and the excessive heat of the day; and all these things, with people
staring at me, and pointing me out to others, were so very distressing that in me the words
of the prophet were realized: “My spirit within me was desolate2262.” I was kept in this state
till noon, and heartily did I repent of this visit, and that I had brought upon myself this piece
of discourtesy; and my own reflection vexed me worse than this injury done me by my enemies2263,
warring as it did against itself, and changing into a regret that I had made the
venture. At last the approach to the Altars was thrown open, and we were admitted to the
sanctuary; the crowd, however, were excluded, though my deacon entered along with me,
supporting with his arm my exhausted frame. I addressed his Lordship, and stood for a
moment, expecting from him an invitation to be seated; but when nothing of the kind was
heard from him, I turned towards one of the distant seats, and rested myself upon it, still
expecting that he would utter something that was friendly, or at all events kind; or at least
give one nod of recognition.</p>

<p>Any hopes I had were doomed to complete disappointment. There ensued a silence
dead as night, and looks as downcast as in tragedy, and daze, and dumbfoundedness, and
perfect dumbness. A long interval of time it was, dragged out as if it were in the blackness
of night. So struck down was I by this reception, in which he did not deign to accord me
the merest utterance even of those common salutations by which you discharge the courtesies
of a chance meeting2264,—“welcome,” for instance, or “where do you come from?” or “to
what am I indebted for this pleasure?” or “on what important business are you here?”—that
I was inclined to make this spell of silence into a picture of the life led in the underworld.
Nay, I condemn the similitude as inadequate. For in that underworld the equality of conditions
is complete, and none of the things that cause the tragedies of life on earth disturb
existence. Their glory, as the Prophet says, does not follow men down there; each individual
soul, abandoning the things so eagerly clung to by the majority here, his petulance, and
pride, and conceit, enters that lower world in simple unencumbered nakedness; so that none
of the miseries of this life are to be found among them. Still2265, notwithstanding this reservation,
my condition then did appear to me like an underworld, a murky dungeon, a gloomy
torture-chamber; the more so, when I reflected what treasures of social courtesies we have
inherited from our fathers, and what recorded deeds of it we shall leave to our descendants.
Why, indeed, should I speak at all of that affectionate disposition of our fathers towards
each other? No wonder that, being all naturally equal2266, they wished for no advantage
over one another, but thought to exceed each other only in humility. But my mind was
penetrated most of all with this thought; that the Lord of all creation, the Only-begotten
Son, Who was in the bosom of the Father, Who was in the beginning, Who was in the form
of God, Who upholds all things by the word of His power, humbled Himself not only in
this respect, that in the flesh He sojourned amongst men, but also that He welcomed even
Judas His own betrayer, when he drew near to kiss Him, on His blessed lips; and that when
He had entered into the house of Simon the leper He, as loving all men, upbraided his host,
that He had not been kissed by him: whereas I was not reckoned by him as equal even to
that leper; and yet what was I, and what was he? I cannot discover any difference between
us. If one looks at it from the mundane point of view, where was the height from which he
had descended, where was the dust in which I lay? If, indeed, one must regard things of this
fleshly life, thus much perhaps it will hurt no one’s feelings to assert that, looking at our
lineage, whether as noble or as free, our position was about on a par; though, if one looked
in either for the true freedom and nobility, i.e. that of the soul, each of us will be found

equally a bondsman of Sin; each equally needs One Who will take away his sins; it was Another
Who ransomed us both from Death and Sin with His own blood, Who redeemed us,
and yet showed no contempt of those whom He has redeemed, calling them though He does
from deadness to life, and healing every infirmity of their souls and bodies.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that the amount of this conceit and overweening pride was so great, that
even the height of heaven was almost too narrow limits for it (and yet I could see no cause
or occasion whatever for this diseased state of mind, such as might make it excusable in the
case of some who in certain circumstances contract it; when, for instance, rank or education,
or pre-eminence in dignities of office may have happened to inflate the vainer minds), I had
no means whereby to advise myself to keep quiet: for my heart within me was swelling with
indignation at the absurdity of the whole proceeding, and was rejecting all the reasons for
enduring it. Then, if ever, did I feel admiration for that divine Apostle who so vividly depicts
the civil war that rages within us, declaring that there is a certain “law of sin in the members,
warring against the law of the mind,” and often making the mind a captive, and a slave as
well, to itself. This was the very array, in opposition, of two contending feelings that I saw
within myself: the one, of anger at the insult caused by pride, the other prompting to appease
the rising storm. When by God’s grace, the worse inclination had failed to get the mastery,
I at last said to him, “But is it, then, that some one of the things required for your personal
comfort is being hindered by our presence, and is it time that we withdrew?” On his declaring
that he had no bodily needs, I spoke to him some words calculated to heal, so far as in me
lay, his ill-feeling. When he had, in a very few words, declared that the anger he felt towards
me was owing to many injuries done him, I for my part answered him thus: “Lies possess
an immense power amongst mankind to deceive: but in the Divine Judgment there will be
no place for the misunderstandings thus arising. In my relations towards yourself, my conscience
is bold enough to prompt me to hope that I may obtain forgiveness for all my other
sins, but that, if I have acted in any way to harm you, this may remain for ever unforgiven.”
He was indignant at this speech, and did not suffer the proofs of what I had said to be added.</p>
<p>It was now past six o’clock, and the bath had been well prepared, and the banquet was

mysteries on the Sabbath. While Chrysostom requireth it of the rich Lords of Villages, that they build Churches
in them (Hom. 18 in Act.), he distinguisheth those congregations that were on other days from those that were
held upon the Lord’s day. ‘Upon those congregations (συνάξεις) Prayers and hymns were had, in these an oblation
was made on every Lord’s day,’ and for that cause the Lord’s day is in Chrysostom called, ‘dies panis’. Athanasius

how this disciple of the Gospel imitates the Lord of the Gospel: He, when eating and
drinking with publicans and sinners, answered to those who found fault with Him that He
did it for love of mankind: this disciple considers it a sin and a pollution to have us at his
board, even after all that fatigue which we underwent on the journey, after all that excessive
heat out of doors, in which we were baked while sitting at his gates; after all that gloomy
sullenness with which he treated us to the bitter end, when we had come into his presence.
He sends us off to toil painfully, with a frame now thoroughly exhausted with the over-fatigue,
over the same distance, the same route: so that we scarcely reached our travelling company
at sunset, after we had suffered many mishaps on the way. For a storm-cloud, gathered into
a mass in the clear air by an eddy of wind, drenched us to the skin with its floods of rain;
for owing to the excessive sultriness, we had made no preparation against any shower.
However, by God’s grace we escaped, though in the plight of shipwrecked sailors from the
waves: and right glad were we to reach our company.</p>
<p>Having joined our forces we rested there that night, and at last arrived alive in our own
district; having reaped in addition this result of our meeting him, that the memory of all
that had happened before was revived by this last insult offered to us; and, you see, we are
positively compelled to take measures, for the future, on our own behalf, or rather on his
behalf; for it was because his designs were not checked on former occasions that he has
proceeded to this unmeasured display of vanity. Something, therefore, I think, must be done
on our part, in order that he may improve upon himself, and may be taught that he is human,
and has no authority to insult and to disgrace those who possess the same beliefs and the
same rank as himself. For just consider; suppose we granted for a moment, for the sake of
argument, that it is true that I have done something that has annoyed him, what trial2268
was instituted against us, to judge either of the fact or the hearsay? What proofs were given
of this supposed injury? What Canons were cited against us? What legitimate episcopal
decision confirmed any verdict passed upon us? And supposing any of these processes had
taken place, and that in the proper way, my standing2269 in the Church might certainly have
been at stake, but what Canons could have sanctioned insults offered to a free-born person,
and disgrace inflicted on one of equal rank with himself? “Judge righteous judgment,” you

excusable. If our dignity is to be estimated on the ground of priestly jurisdiction, the privilege
of each recorded by the Council2270 is one and the same; or rather the oversight of Catholic
correction2271, from the fact that we possess an equal share of it, is so. But if some are inclined
to regard each of us by himself, divested of any priestly dignity, in what respect has one any
advantage over the other; in education for instance, or in birth connecting with the noblest
and most illustrious lineage, or in theology? These things will be found either equal, or at
all events not inferior, in me. “But what about revenue?” he will say. I would rather not be
obliged to speak of this in his case; thus much only it will suffice to say, that our own was
so much at the beginning, and is so much now; and to leave it to others to enquire into the
causes of this increase of our revenue2272 , nursed as it is up till now, and growing almost
daily by means of noble undertakings. What licence, then, has he to put an insult upon us,
seeing that he has neither superiority of birth to show, nor a rank exalted above all others,
nor a commanding power of speech, nor any previous kindness done to me? While, even
if he had all this to show, the fault of having slighted those of gentle birth would still be inexcusable.
But he has not got it; and therefore I deem it right to see that this malady of
puffed-up pride is not left without a cure; and it will be its cure to put it down to its proper
level, and reduce its inflated dimensions, by letting off a little of the conceit with which he
is bursting. The manner of effecting this we leave to God.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:
NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. This volume contains selected works
of St. Basil the Great. St. Basil is well-known for his care for the poor and his important
impact upon the communal practices of the monastic life. The Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating
texts from some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually
enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive
and fruitful even today!</p>

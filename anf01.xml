<head>ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr
and Irenaeus</head>
<p>Author(s): Justin Martyr, St. (c.100-165)
Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. This
particular volume contains works by St. Clement, Mathetes,
St. Polycarp, St. Ignatius, Barnabas, St. Papias, St. Justin
Martyr, and St. Irenaeus. These writings were heavily influential
on the early Church, and for good reason, as they are
inspirational and encouraging. These volumes also come
with many useful notes, providing the reader with new levels
of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part
of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.

<p>Against Heresies: Book I 841</p>
<p>Preface. 842</p>
<p>Chapter I.—Absurd ideas of the disciples of Valentinus as to the origin, name, 
order, and conjugal productions of their fancied Æons, with the passages of
Scripture which they adapt to their opinions.845</p>
<p>Chapter II.—The Propator was known to Monogenes alone. Ambition, 
disturbance, and danger into which Sophia fell; her shapeless offspring: she is
restored by Horos. The production of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, in order to
the completion of the Æons. Manner of the production of Jesus.847</p>

opinions.851</p>

origin of the visible world from her disturbances.855</p>
<p>Chapter V.—Formation of the Demiurge; description of him. He is the creator 
of everything outside of the Pleroma.859</p>
<p>Chapter VI.—The threefold kind of man feigned by these heretics: good works 
needless for them, though necessary to others: their abandoned morals.862</p>
<p>Chapter VII.—The mother Achamoth, when all her seed are perfected, shall 
pass into the Pleroma, accompanied by those men who are spiritual; the
Demiurge, with animal men, shall pass into the intermediate habitation; but all
material men shall go into corruption. Their blasphemous opinions against the
true incarnation of Christ by the Virgin Mary. Their views as to the prophecies.

<p>Against Heresies: Book II 937</p>
<p>Preface. 938</p>
<p>Chapter I.—There is but one God: the impossibility of its being otherwise. 939</p>
<p>Chapter II.—The world was not formed by angels, or by any other being, contrary 
to the will of the most high God, but was made by the Father through the Word.941</p>
<p>Chapter III.—The Bythus and Pleroma of the Valentinians, as well as the God 
of Marcion, shown to be absurd; the world was actually created by the same
Being who had conceived the idea of it, and was not the fruit of defect or
ignorance.944</p>
<p>Chapter IV.—The absurdity of the supposed vacuum and defect of the heretics 
is demonstrated.946</p>
<p>Chapter V.—This world was not formed by any other beings within the territory 
which is contained by the Father.949</p>
<p>Chapter VI.—The angels and the Creator of the world could not have been 
ignorant of the Supreme God.952</p>
<p>Chapter VII.—Created things are not the images of those Æons who are within 
the Pleroma.954</p>
<p>Chapter VIII.—Created things are not a shadow of the Pleroma. 959</p>
<p>Chapter IX.—There is but one Creator of the world, God the Father: this the 
constant belief of the Church.961</p>
<p>Chapter X.—Perverse interpretations of Scripture by the heretics: God created 
all things out of nothing, and not from pre-existent matter.963</p>
<p>Chapter XI.—The heretics, from their disbelief of the truth, have fallen into an 
abyss of error: reasons for investigating their systems.965</p>

<pb n="xxix"/>
<p>Chapter XII.—The Triacontad of the heretics errs both by defect and excess: 
Sophia could never have produced anything apart from her consort; Logos and
Sige could not have been contemporaries.966</p>
<p>Chapter XIII.—The first order of production maintained by the heretics is 
altogether indefensible.970</p>
<p>Chapter XIV.—Valentinus and his followers derived the principles of their 
system from the heathen; the names only are changed.976</p>
<p>Chapter XV.—No account can be given of these productions. 982</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.—The Creator of the world either produced of Himself the images 
of things to be made, or the Pleroma was formed after the image of some previous
system; and so on ad infinitum.984</p>
<p>Chapter XVII.—Inquiry into the production of the Æons: whatever its supposed 
nature, it is in every respect inconsistent; and on the hypothesis of the heretics,
even Nous and the Father Himself would be stained with ignorance.986</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII.—Sophia was never really in ignorance or passion; her Enthymesis 
could not have been separated from herself, or exhibited special tendencies of
its own.992</p>
<p>Chapter XIX.—Absurdities of the heretics as to their own origin: their opinions 
respecting the Demiurge shown to be equally untenable and ridiculous.995</p>
<p>Chapter XX.—Futility of the arguments adduced to demonstrate the sufferings 
of the twelfth Æon, from the parables, the treachery of Judas, and the passion
of our Saviour.1000</p>
<p>Chapter XXI.—The twelve apostles were not a type of the Æons. 1003</p>
<p>Chapter XXII.—The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was 
baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His
baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died.1005</p>
<p>Chapter XXIII.—The woman who suffered from an issue of blood was no type 
of the suffering Æon.1011</p>
<p>Chapter XXIV.—Folly of the arguments derived by the heretics from numbers, 
letters, and syllables.1013</p>
<p>Chapter XXV.—God is not to be sought after by means of letters, syllables, and 
numbers; necessity of humility in such investigations.1020</p>
<p>Chapter XXVI.—“Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.” 1022</p>
<p>Chapter XXVII.—Proper mode of interpreting parables and obscure passages 
of Scripture.1024</p>

<pb n="xxx"/>
<p>Chapter XXVIII.—Perfect knowledge cannot be attained in the present life: 
many questions must be submissively left in the hands of God.1026</p>
<p>Chapter XXIX.—Refutation of the views of the heretics as to the future destiny 
of the soul and body.1033</p>
<p>Chapter XXX.—Absurdity of their styling themselves spiritual, while the 
Demiurge is declared to be animal.1035</p>
<p>Chapter XXXI.—Recapitulation and application of the foregoing arguments. 1041</p>
<p>Chapter XXXII.—Further exposure of the wicked and blasphemous doctrines 
of the heretics.1044</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIII.—Absurdity of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. 1048</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIV.—Souls can be recognised in the separate state, and are immortal 
although they once had a beginning.1051</p>
<p>Chapter XXXV.—Refutation of Basilides, and of the opinion that the prophets 
uttered their predictions under the inspiration of different gods.1054</p>
<p>Against Heresies: Book III 1057</p>
<p>Preface. 1058</p>
<p>Chapter I.—The apostles did not commence to preach the Gospel, or to place 
anything on record until they were endowed with the gifts and power of the
Holy Spirit. They preached one God alone, Maker of heaven and earth.1059</p>
<p>Chapter II.—The heretics follow neither Scripture nor tradition. 1060</p>
<p>Chapter III.—A refutation of the heretics, from the fact that, in the various 
Churches, a perpetual succession of bishops was kept up.1061</p>
<p>Chapter IV.—The truth is to be found nowhere else but in the Catholic Church, 
the sole depository of apostolical doctrine. Heresies are of recent formation,
and cannot trace their origin up to the apostles.1064</p>
<p>Chapter V.—Christ and His apostles, without any fraud, deception, or hypocrisy, 
preached that one God, the Father, was the founder of all things. They did not
accommodate their doctrine to the prepossessions of their hearers.1066</p>
<p>Chapter VI—The Holy Ghost, throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, made 
mention of no other God or Lord, save him who is the true God.</p>
<p>Chapter VII.—Reply to an objection founded on the words of St. Paul (2 Cor. 
iv. 4). St. Paul occasionally uses words not in their grammatical sequence.1072</p>
<p>Chapter VIII.—Answer to an objection, arising from the words of Christ (Matt. 
vi. 24). God alone is to be really called God and Lord, for He is without beginning
and end.1074</p>

<pb n="xxxi"/>
<p>Chapter IX.—One and the same God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is He 
whom the prophets foretold, and who was declared by the Gospel. Proof of this,
at the outset, from St. Matthew’s Gospel.1076</p>
<p>Chapter X.—Proofs of the foregoing, drawn from the Gospels of Mark and Luke. 1079</p>
<p>Chapter XI—Proofs in continuation, extracted from St. John’s Gospel. The
Gospels are four in number, neither more nor less. Mystic reasons for this. 1085</p>
<p>Chapter XII.—Doctrine of the rest of the apostles. 1092</p>
<p>Chapter XIII—Refutation of the opinion, that Paul was the only apostle who 
had knowledge of the truth.1105</p>
<p>Chapter XIV.—If Paul had known any mysteries unrevealed to the other apostles, 
Luke, his constant companion and fellow-traveller, could not have been ignorant
of them; neither could the truth have possibly lain hid from him, through whom
alone we learn many and most important particulars of the Gospel history.1107</p>
<p>Chapter XV.—Refutation of the Ebionites, who disparaged the authority of St. 
Paul, from the writings of St. Luke, which must be received as a whole. Exposure
of the hypocrisy, deceit, and pride of the Gnostics. The apostles and their disciples
knew and preached one God, the Creator of the world.1111</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.—Proofs from the apostolic writings, that Jesus Christ was one 
and the same, the only begotten Son of God, perfect God and perfect man.1113</p>
<p>Chapter XVII.—The apostles teach that it was neither Christ nor the Saviour, 
but the Holy Spirit, who did descend upon Jesus. The reason for this descent.1121</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII.—Continuation of the foregoing argument. Proofs from the 
writings of St. Paul, and from the words of Our Lord, that Christ and Jesus
cannot be considered as distinct beings; neither can it be alleged that the Son
of God became man merely in appearance, but that He did so truly and actually.1124</p>
<p>Chapter XIX.—Jesus Christ was not a mere man, begotten from Joseph in the 
ordinary course of nature, but was very God, begotten of the Father most high,
and very man, born of the Virgin.1130</p>
<p>Chapter XX.—God showed himself, by the fall of man, as patient, benign, 
merciful, mighty to save. Man is therefore most ungrateful, if, unmindful of his
own lot, and of the benefits held out to him, he do not acknowledge divine grace.1133</p>
<p>Chapter XXI.—A vindication of the prophecy in Isa. vii. 14 against the 
misinterpretations of Theodotion, Aquila, the Ebionites, and the Jews. Authority
of the Septuagint version. Arguments in proof that Christ was born of a virgin.1137</p>
<p>Chapter XXII.—Christ assumed actual flesh, conceived and born of the Virgin. 1143</p>

<pb n="xxxii"/>
<p>Chapter XXIII.—Arguments in opposition to Tatian, showing that it was 
consonant to divine justice and mercy that the first Adam should first partake
in that salvation offered to all by Christ.1146</p>
<p>Chapter XXIV.—Recapitulation of the various arguments adduced against 
Gnostic impiety under all its aspects. The heretics, tossed about by every blast
of doctrine, are opposed by the uniform teaching of the Church, which remains
so always, and is consistent with itself.1151</p>
<p>Chapter XXV.—This world is ruled by the providence of one God, who is both 
endowed with infinite justice to punish the wicked, and with infinite goodness
to bless the pious, and impart to them salvation.1153</p>
<p>Elucidation 1156</p>
<p>Against Heresies: Book IV 1159</p>
<p>Preface. 1160</p>
<p>Chapter I.—The Lord acknowledged but one God and Father. 1162</p>
<p>Chapter II.—Proofs from the plain testimony of Moses, and of the other 
prophets, whose words are the words of Christ, that there is but one God, the
founder of the world, whom Our Lord preached, and whom He called His
Father.1163</p>
<p>Chapter III.—Answer to the cavils of the Gnostics. We are not to suppose that 
the true God can be changed, or come to an end because the heavens, which
are His throne and the earth, His footstool, shall pass away.1166</p>
<p>Chapter IV.—Answer to another objection, showing that the destruction of 
Jerusalem, which was the city of the great King, diminished nothing from the
supreme majesty and power of God, for that this destruction was put in execution
by the most wise counsel of the same God.1167</p>
<p>Chapter V.—The author returns to his former argument, and shows that there 
was but one God announced by the law and prophets, whom Christ confesses
as His Father, and who, through His word, one living God with Him, made
Himself known to men in both covenants.1169</p>
<p>Chapter VI.—Explanation of the words of Christ, “No man knoweth the Father, 
but the Son,” etc.; which words the heretics misinterpret. Proof that, by the
Father revealing the Son, and by the Son being revealed, the Father was never
unknown.1172</p>
<p>Chapter VII.—Recapitulation of the foregoing argument, showing that Abraham, 
through the revelation of the Word, knew the Father, and the coming of the
Son of God. For this cause, he rejoiced to see the day of Christ, when the promises
made to him should be fulfilled. The fruit of this rejoicing has flowed to posterity,

<pb n="xxxiii"/>
viz., to those who are partakers in the faith of Abraham, but not to the Jews who
reject the Word of God.1176</p>
<p>Chapter VIII.—Vain attempts of Marcion and his followers, who exclude 
Abraham from the salvation bestowed by Christ, who liberated not only
Abraham, but the seed of Abraham, by fulfilling and not destroying the law
when He healed on the Sabbath-day.1178</p>
<p>Chapter IX.—There is but one author, and one end to both covenants. 1181</p>
<p>Chapter X.—The Old Testament Scriptures, and those written by Moses in 
particular, do everywhere make mention of the Son of God, and foretell His
advent and passion. From this fact it follows that they were inspired by one and
the same God.1184</p>
<p>Chapter XI.—The old prophets and righteous men knew beforehand of the 
advent of Christ, and earnestly desired to see and hear Him, He revealing himself
in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghost, and without any change in Himself,
enriching men day by day with benefits, but conferring them in greater
abundance on later than on former generations.1186</p>
<p>Chapter XII.—It clearly appears that there was but one author of both the old 
and the new law, from the fact that Christ condemned traditions and customs
repugnant to the former, while He confirmed its most important precepts, and
taught that He was Himself the end of the Mosaic law.1189</p>
<p>Chapter XIII.—Christ did not abrogate the natural precepts of the law, but 
rather fulfilled and extended them. He removed the yoke and bondage of the
old law, so that mankind, being now set free, might serve God with that trustful
piety which becometh sons.1192</p>
<p>Chapter XIV.—If God demands obedience from man, if He formed man, called 
him and placed him under laws, it was merely for man’s welfare; not that God
stood in need of man, but that He graciously conferred upon man His favours
in every possible manner.1195</p>
<p>Chapter XV.—At first God deemed it sufficient to inscribe the natural law, or 
the Decalogue, upon the hearts of men; but afterwards He found it necessary
to bridle, with the yoke of the Mosaic law, the desires of the Jews, who were
abusing their liberty; and even to add some special commands, because of the
hardness of their hearts.1198</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.—Perfect righteousness was conferred neither by circumcision 
nor by any other legal ceremonies. The Decalogue, however, was not cancelled
by Christ, but is always in force: men were never released from its
commandments.1201</p>

<pb n="xxxiv"/>
<p>Chapter XVII.—Proof that God did not appoint the Levitical dispensation for 
His own sake, or as requiring such service; for He does, in fact, need nothing
from men.1205</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII.—Concerning sacrifices and oblations, and those who truly offer 
them.1210</p>
<p>Chapter XIX.—Earthly things may be the type of heavenly, but the latter cannot 
be the types of others still superior and unknown; nor can we, without absolute
madness, maintain that God is known to us only as the type of a still unknown
and superior being.1214</p>
<p>Chapter XX.—That one God formed all things in the world, by means of the 
Word and the Holy Spirit: and that although He is to us in this life invisible and
incomprehensible, nevertheless He is not unknown; inasmuch as His works do
declare Him, and His Word has shown that in many modes He may be seen
and known.1216</p>
<p>Chapter XXI.—Abraham’s faith was identical with ours; this faith was prefigured 
by the words and actions of the old patriarchs.1226</p>
<p>Chapter XXII.—Christ did not come for the sake of the men of one age only, 
but for all who, living righteously and piously, had believed upon Him; and for
those, too, who shall believe.1228</p>
<p>Chapter XXIII.—The patriarchs and prophets by pointing out the advent of 
Christ, fortified thereby, as it were, the way of posterity to the faith of Christ;
and so the labours of the apostles were lessened inasmuch as they gathered in
the fruits of the labours of others.1230</p>
<p>Chapter XXIV.—The conversion of the Gentiles was more difficult than that 
of the Jews; the labours of those apostles, therefore who engaged in the former
task, were greater than those who undertook the latter.1232</p>
<p>Chapter XXV.—Both covenants were prefigured in Abraham, and in the labour 
of Tamar; there was, however, but one and the same God to each covenant.1234</p>
<p>Chapter XXVI.—The treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ; the true exposition 
of the Scriptures is to be found in the Church alone.1236</p>
<p>Chapter XXVII—The sins of the men of old time, which incurred the displeasure 
of God, were, by His providence, committed to writing, that we might derive
instruction thereby, and not be filled with pride. We must not, therefore, infer
that there was another God than He whom Christ preached; we should rather
fear, lest the one and the same God who inflicted punishment on the ancients,
should bring down heavier upon us.1240</p>
<p>Chapter XXVIII.—Those persons prove themselves senseless who exaggerate 
the mercy of Christ, but are silent as to the judgment, and look only at the more

<pb n="xxxv"/>
abundant grace of the New Testament; but, forgetful of the greater degree of
perfection which it demands from us, they endeavour to show that there is
another God beyond Him who created the world.1245</p>
<p>Chapter XXIX.—Refutation of the arguments of the Marcionites, who attempted 
to show that God was the author of sin, because He blinded Pharaoh and his
servants.1248</p>
<p>Chapter XXX.—Refutation of another argument adduced by the Marcionites, 
that God directed the Hebrews to spoil the Egyptians.1250</p>
<p>Chapter XXXI.—We should not hastily impute as crimes to the men of old time 
those actions which the Scripture has not condemned, but should rather seek
in them types of things to come: an example of this in the incest committed by
Lot.1254</p>
<p>Chapter XXXII.—That one God was the author of both Testaments, is confirmed 
by the authority of a presbyter who had been taught by the apostles.1257</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIII.—Whosoever confesses that one God is the author of both 
Testaments, and diligently reads the Scriptures in company with the presbyters
of the Church, is a true spiritual disciple; and he will rightly understand and
interpret all that the prophets have declared respecting Christ and the liberty
of the New Testament.1259</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIV.—Proof against the Marcionites, that the prophets referred in 
all their predictions to our Christ.1269</p>
<p>Chapter XXXV.—A refutation of those who allege that the prophets uttered 
some predictions under the inspiration of the highest, others from the Demiurge.
Disagreements of the Valentinians among themselves with regard to these same
predictions.1272</p>
<p>Chapter XXXVI.—The prophets were sent from one and the same Father from 
whom the Son was sent.1275</p>
<p>Chapter XXXVII.—Men are possessed of free will, and endowed with the faculty 
of making a choice. It is not true, therefore, that some are by nature good, and
others bad.1283</p>
<p>Chapter XXXVIII.—Why man was not made perfect from the beginning. 1288</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIX.—Man is endowed with the faculty of distinguishing good and 
evil; so that, without compulsion, he has the power, by his own will and choice,
to perform God’s commandments, by doing which he avoids the evils prepared
for the rebellious.1291</p>
<p>Chapter XL.—One and the same God the Father inflicts punishment on the 
reprobate, and bestows rewards on the elect.1294</p>

<pb n="xxxvi"/>
<p>Chapter XLI.—Those persons who do not believe in God, but who are 
disobedient, are angels and sons of the devil, not indeed by nature, but by
imitation. Close of this book, and scope of the succeeding one.1296</p>
<p>Against Heresies: Book V 1299</p>
<p>Preface. 1300</p>
<p>Chapter I.—Christ alone is able to teach divine things, and to redeem us: He, 
the same, took flesh of the Virgin Mary, not merely in appearance, but actually,
by the operation of the Holy Spirit, in order to renovate us. Strictures on the
conceits of Valentinus and Ebion.1301</p>
<p>Chapter II.—When Christ visited us in His grace, He did not come to what did 
not belong to Him: also, by shedding His true blood for us, and exhibiting to
us His true flesh in the Eucharist, He conferred upon our flesh the capacity of
salvation.1304</p>
<p>Chapter III.—The power and glory of God shine forth in the weakness of human 
flesh, as He will render our body a participator of the resurrection and of
immortality, although He has formed it from the dust of the earth; He will also
bestow upon it the enjoyment of immortality, just as He grants it this short life
in common with the soul.1306</p>
<p>Chapter IV.—Those persons are deceived who feign another God the Father 
besides the Creator of the world; for he must have been feeble and useless, or
else malignant and full of envy, if he be either unable or unwilling to extend
external life to our bodies.1309</p>
<p>Chapter V.—The prolonged life of the ancients, the translation of Elijah and of 
Enoch in their own bodies, as well as the preservation of Jonah, of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, in the midst of extreme peril, are clear demonstrations
that God can raise up our bodies to life eternal.1310</p>
<p>Chapter VI.—God will bestow salvation upon the whole nature of man, 
consisting of body and soul in close union, since the Word took it upon Him,
and adorned with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, of whom our bodies are, and are
termed, the temples.1312</p>
<p>Chapter VII.—Inasmuch as Christ did rise in our flesh, it follows that we shall 
be also raised in the same; since the resurrection promised to us should not be
referred to spirits naturally immortal, but to bodies in themselves mortal.1314</p>
<p>Chapter VIII.—The gifts of the Holy Spirit which we receive prepare us for 
incorruption, render us spiritual, and separate us from carnal men. These two
classes are signified by the clean and unclean animals in the legal dispensation.1316</p>

<pb n="xxxvii"/>
<p>Chapter IX.—Showing how that passage of the apostle which the heretics pervert, 
should be understood; viz., “Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of
God.”1319</p>
<p>Chapter X.—By a comparison drawn from the wild olive-tree, whose quality 
but not whose nature is changed by grafting, he proves more important things;
he points out also that man without the Spirit is not capable of bringing forth
fruit, or of inheriting the kingdom of God.1322</p>
<p>Chapter XI.—Treats upon the actions of carnal and of spiritual persons; also, 
that the spiritual cleansing is not to be referred to the substance of our bodies,
but to the manner of our former life.1324</p>
<p>Chapter XII.—Of the difference between life and death; of the breath of life and 
the vivifying Spirit: also how it is that the substance of flesh revives which once
was dead.1326</p>
<p>Chapter XIII.—In the dead who were raised by Christ we possess the highest 
proof of the resurrection; and our hearts are shown to be capable of life eternal,
because they can now receive the Spirit of God.1330</p>
<p>Chapter XIV.—Unless the flesh were to be saved, the Word would not have 
taken upon Him flesh of the same substance as ours: from this it would follow
that neither should we have been reconciled by Him.1334</p>
<p>Chapter XV.—Proofs of the resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel; the same God 
who created us will also raise us up.1337</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.—Since our bodies return to the earth, it follows that they have 
their substance from it; also, by the advent of the Word, the image of God in us
appeared in a clearer light.1340</p>
<p>Chapter XVII.—There is but one Lord and one God, the Father and Creator of 
all things, who has loved us in Christ, given us commandments, and remitted
our sins; whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be, when He forgave
our sins.1342</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII.—God the Father and His Word have formed all created things 
(which They use) by Their own power and wisdom, not out of defect or
ignorance. The Son of God, who received all power from the Father, would
otherwise never have taken flesh upon Him.1345</p>
<p>Chapter XIX.—A comparison is instituted between the disobedient and sinning 
Eve and the Virgin Mary, her patroness. Various and discordant heresies are
mentioned.1348</p>
<p>Chapter XX.—Those pastors are to be heard to whom the apostles committed 
the Churches, possessing one and the same doctrine of salvation; the heretics,

<pb n="xxxviii"/>
on the other hand, are to be avoided. We must think soberly with regard to the
mysteries of the faith.1350</p>
<p>Chapter XXI.—Christ is the head of all things already mentioned. It was fitting 
that He should be sent by the Father, the Creator of all things, to assume human
nature, and should be tempted by Satan, that He might fulfil the promises, and
carry off a glorious and perfect victory.1352</p>
<p>Chapter XXII.—The true Lord and the one God is declared by the law, and 
manifested by Christ His Son in the Gospel; whom alone we should adore, and
from Him we must look for all good things, not from Satan.1355</p>
<p>Chapter XXIII.—The devil is well practised in falsehood, by which Adam having 
been led astray, sinned on the sixth day of the creation, in which day also he has
been renewed by Christ.1357</p>
<p>Chapter XXIV.—Of the constant falsehood of the devil, and of the powers and 
governments of the world, which we ought to obey, inasmuch as they are
appointed of God, not of the devil.1359</p>
<p>Chapter XXV.—The fraud, pride, and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist, as 
described by Daniel and Paul.1362</p>
<p>Chapter XXVI.—John and Daniel have predicted the dissolution and desolation 
of the Roman Empire, which shall precede the end of the world and the eternal
kingdom of Christ. The Gnostics are refuted, those tools of Satan, who invent
another Father different from the Creator.1365</p>
<p>Chapter XXVII.—The future judgment by Christ. Communion with and 
separation from the divine being. The eternal punishment of unbelievers.1368</p>
<p>Chapter XXVIII.—The distinction to be made between the righteous and the 
wicked. The future apostasy in the time of Antichrist, and the end of the world.1370</p>
<p>Chapter XXIX.—All things have been created for the service of man. The deceits, 
wickedness, and apostate power of Antichrist. This was prefigured at the deluge,
as afterwards by the persecution of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.1372</p>
<p>Chapter XXX.—Although certain as to the number of the name of Antichrist, 
yet we should come to no rash conclusions as to the name itself, because this
number is capable of being fitted to many names. Reasons for this point being
reserved by the Holy Spirit. Antichrist’s reign and death.1374</p>
<p>Chapter XXXI.—The preservation of our bodies is confirmed by the resurrection 
and ascension of Christ: the souls of the saints during the intermediate period
are in a state of expectation of that time when they shall receive their perfect
and consummated glory.1377</p>

<pb n="xxxix"/>
<p>Chapter XXXII.—In that flesh in which the saints have suffered so many 
afflictions, they shall receive the fruits of their labours; especially since all creation
waits for this, and God promises it to Abraham and his seed.1379</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIII.—Further proofs of the same proposition, drawn from the 
promises made by Christ, when He declared that He would drink of the fruit
of the vine with His disciples in His Father’s kingdom, while at the same time
He promised to reward them an hundred-fold, and to make them partake of
banquets. The blessing pronounced by Jacob had pointed out this already, as
Papias and the elders have interpreted it.1381</p>
<p>Chapter XXXIV.—He fortifies his opinions with regard to the temporal and 
earthly kingdom of the saints after their resurrection, by the various testimonies
of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel; also by the parable of the servants
watching, to whom the Lord promised that He would minister.1384</p>
<p>Chapter XXXV.—He contends that these testimonies already alleged cannot be 
understood allegorically of celestial blessings, but that they shall have their
fulfilment after the coming of Antichrist, and the resurrection, in the terrestrial
Jerusalem. To the former prophecies he subjoins others drawn from Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and the Apocalypse of John.1387</p>
<p>Chapter XXXVI.—Men shall be actually raised: the world shall not be annihilated; 
but there shall be various mansions for the saints, according to the rank allotted
to each individual. All things shall be subject to God the Father, and so shall He
be all in all.1390</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>This volume, containing the equivalent of three volumes of the Edinburgh series of the
Ante-Nicene Fathers, will be found a library somewhat complete in itself. The Apostolic
Fathers and those associated with them in the third generation, are here placed together in
a handbook, which, with the inestimable Scriptures, supplies a succinct autobiography of
the Spouse of Christ for the first two centuries. No Christian scholar has ever before possessed,
in faithful versions of such compact form, a supplement so essential to the right
understanding of the New Testament itself. It is a volume indispensable to all scholars, and
to every library, private or public, in this country.</p>
<p>The American Editor has performed the humble task of ushering these works into
American use, with scanty contributions of his own. Such was the understanding with the
public: they were to be presented with the Edinburgh series, free from appreciable colour
or alloy. His duty was (1) to give historic arrangement to the confused mass of the original
series; (2) to supply, in continuity, such brief introductory notices as might slightly popularize
what was apparently meant for scholars only, in the introductions of the translators; (3) to
supply a few deficiencies by short notes and references; (4) to add such references to Scripture,
or to authors of general repute, as might lend additional aid to students, without clogging
or overlaying the comments of the translators; and (5) to note such corruptions or distortions
of Patristic testimony as have been circulated, in the spirit of the forged Decretals, by those
who carry on the old imposture by means essentially equivalent. Too long have they been
allowed to speak to the popular mind as if the Fathers were their own; while, to every candid
reader, it must be evident that, alike, the testimony, the arguments, and the silence of the
Ante-Nicene writers confound all attempts to identify the ecclesiastical establishment of
“the Holy Roman Empire,” with “the Holy Catholic Church” of the ancient creeds.</p>
<p>In performing this task, under the pressure of a virtual obligation to issue the first volume
in the first month of the new year, the Editor has relied upon the kindly aid of an able friend,
as typographical corrector of the Edinburgh sheets. It is only necessary to add, that he has
bracketed all his own notes, so as to assume the responsibility for them; but his introductions
are so separated from those of the translators, that, after the first instance, he has not thought
it requisite to suffix his initials to these brief contributions. He regrets that the most important
volume of the series is necessarily the experimental one, and comes out under disadvantages
from which it may be expected that succeeding issues will be free. May the Lord God of our
Fathers bless the undertaking to all my fellow-Christians, and make good to them the
promise which was once felicitously chosen for the motto of a similar series of publications:
“Yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy
teachers.”</p>

<p>N.B.—The following advertisement of the original editors will be useful here:—
The Ante-Nicene Christian Library is meant to comprise translations into English of
all the extant works of the Fathers down to the date of the first General Council held at Nice
in a.d. 325. The sole provisional exception is that of the more bulky writings of Origen. It
is intended at present only to embrace in the scheme the Contra Celsum and the De Principiis
of that voluminous author; but the whole of his works will be included should the undertaking
prove successful.</p>
<p>The present volume has been translated by the Editors.1 Their object has been to place
the English reader as nearly as possible on a footing of equality with those who are able to
read the original. With this view they have for the most part leaned towards literal exactness;
and wherever any considerable departure from this has been made, a verbatim rendering
has been given at the foot of the page. Brief introductory notices have been prefixed, and
short notes inserted, to indicate varieties of reading, specify references, or elucidate any
obscurity which seemed to exist in the text.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice</head>
<p>[a.d. 100–200.] The Apostolic Fathers are here understood as filling up the second
century of our era. Irenæus, it is true, is rather of the sub-apostolic period; but, as the disciple
of Polycarp, he ought not to be dissociated from that Father’s company. We thus find
ourselves conducted, by this goodly fellowship of witnesses, from the times of the apostles
to those of Tertullian, from the martyrs of the second persecution to those of the sixth.
Those were times of heroism, not of words; an age, not of writers, but of soldiers; not of
talkers, but of sufferers. Curiosity is baffled, but faith and love are fed by these scanty relics
of primitive antiquity. Yet may we well be grateful for what we have. These writings come
down to us as the earliest response of converted nations to the testimony of Jesus. They are
primary evidences of the Canon and the credibility of the New Testament. Disappointment
may be the first emotion of the student who comes down from the mount where he has
dwelt in the tabernacles of evangelists and apostles: for these disciples are confessedly inferior
to the masters; they speak with the voices of infirm and fallible men, and not like the New
Testament writers, with the fiery tongues of the Holy Ghost. Yet the thoughtful and loving
spirit soon learns their exceeding value. For who does not close the records of St. Luke with
longing; to get at least a glimpse of the further history of the progress of the Gospel? What
of the Church when its founders were fallen asleep? Was the Good Shepherd “always” with
His little flock, according to His promise? Was the Blessed Comforter felt in His presence
amid the fires of persecution? Was the Spirit of Truth really able to guide the faithful into
all truth, and to keep them in the truth?</p>
<p>And what had become of the disciples who were the first-fruits of the apostolic ministry?
St. Paul had said, “The same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others
also.” How was this injunction realized? St. Peter’s touching words come to mind, “I will
endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.”
Was this endeavour successfully carried out? To these natural and pious inquiries, the
Apostolic Fathers, though we have a few specimens only of their fidelity, give an emphatic
reply. If the cold-hearted and critical find no charm in the simple, childlike faith which they
exhibit, ennobled though it be by heroic devotion to the Master, we need not marvel. Such
would probably object: “They teach me nothing; I do not relish their multiplied citations
from Scripture.” The answer is, “If you are familiar with Scripture, you owe it largely to
these primitive witnesses to its Canon and its spirit. By their testimony we detect what is
spurious, and we identify what is real. Is it nothing to find that your Bible is their Bible, your
faith their faith, your Saviour their Saviour, your God their God?” Let us reflect also, that,
when copies of the entire Scriptures were rare and costly, these citations were “words fitly
spoken,—apples of gold in pictures of silver.” We are taught by them also that they obeyed
the apostle’s precept, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and


<pb n="5"/>
admonishing,” etc. Thus they reflect the apostolic care that men should be raised up able
to teach others also.</p>
<p>Their very mistakes enable us to attach a higher value to the superiority of inspired
writers. They were not wiser than the naturalists of their day who taught them the history
of the Phoenix and other fables; but nothing of this sort is found in Scripture. The Fathers
are inferior in kind as well as in degree; yet their words are lingering echoes of those whose
words were spoken “as the Spirit gave them utterance.” They are monuments of the power
of the Gospel. They were made out of such material as St. Paul describes when he says, “Such
were some of you.” But for Christ, they would have been worshippers of personified Lust
and Hate, and of every crime. They would have lived for “bread and circus-shows.” Yet to
the contemporaries of a Juvenal they taught the Decalogue and the Sermon on the Mount.
Among such beasts in human form they reared the sacred home; they created the Christian
family; they gave new and holy meanings to the names of wife and mother; they imparted
ideas unknown before of the dignity of man as man; they infused an atmosphere of benevolence
and love; they bestowed the elements of liberty chastened by law; they sanctified human
society by proclaiming the universal brotherhood of redeemed man. As we read the
Apostolic Fathers, we comprehend, in short, the meaning of St. Paul when he said prophetically,
what men were slow to believe, “The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men … But God hath chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound
the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised,
hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.”</p>

<head>Clement of Rome</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="7"/>
<head>Introductory Note to the First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians</head>
<p>[a.d. 30–100.] Clement was probably a Gentile and a Roman. He seems to have been at
Philippi with St. Paul (a.d. 57) when that first-born of the Western churches was passing
through great trials of faith. There, with holy women and others, he ministered to the apostle
and to the saints. As this city was a Roman colony, we need not inquire how a Roman
happened to be there. He was possibly in some public service, and it is not improbable that
he had visited Corinth in those days. From the apostle, and his companion, St. Luke, he had
no doubt learned the use of the Septuagint, in which his knowledge of the Greek tongue
soon rendered him an adept. His copy of that version, however, does not always agree with
the Received Text, as the reader will perceive.</p>
<p>A co-presbyter with Linus and Cletus, he succeeded them in the government of the
Roman Church. I have reluctantly adopted the opinion that his Epistle was written near the
close of his life, and not just after the persecution of Nero. It is not improbable that Linus
and Cletus both perished in that fiery trial, and that Clement’s immediate succession to
their work and place occasions the chronological difficulties of the period. After the death
of the apostles, for the Roman imprisonment and martyrdom of St. Peter seem historical,
Clement was the natural representative of St. Paul, and even of his companion, the “apostle
of the circumcision;” and naturally he wrote the Epistle in the name of the local church,
when brethren looked to them for advice. St. John, no doubt, was still surviving at Patmos
or in Ephesus; but the Philippians, whose intercourse with Rome is attested by the visit of
Epaphroditus, looked naturally to the surviving friends of their great founder; nor was the
aged apostle in the East equally accessible. All roads pointed towards the Imperial City, and
started from its Milliarium Aureum. But, though Clement doubtless wrote the letter, he
conceals his own name, and puts forth the brethren, who seem to have met in council, and
sent a brotherly delegation (Chap. lix.). The entire absence of the spirit of Diotrephes (3
John 9), and the close accordance of the Epistle, in humility and meekness, with that of St.
Peter (1 Pet. v. 1–5), are noteworthy features. The whole will be found animated with the
loving and faithful spirit of St. Paul’s dear Philippians, among whom the writer had learned
the Gospel.</p>
<p>Clement fell asleep, probably soon after he despatched his letter. It is the legacy of one
who reflects the apostolic age in all the beauty and evangelical truth which were the firstfruits
of the Spirit’s presence with the Church. He shares with others the aureole of glory
attributed by St. Paul (Phil. iv. 3), “His name is in the Book of Life.”</p>
<p>The plan of this publication does not permit the restoration, in this volume, of the recently
discovered portions of his work. It is the purpose of the editor to present this, however,
with other recently discovered relics of primitive antiquity, in a supplementary volume,

<pb n="8"/>
should the undertaking meet with sufficient encouragement. The so-called second Epistle
of Clement is now known to be the work of another, and has been relegated to another place
in this series.</p>
<p>The following is the Introductory Notice of the original editors and translators, Drs.
Roberts and Donaldson:—</p>
<p>The first Epistle, bearing the name of Clement, has been preserved to us in a single
manuscript only. Though very frequently referred to by ancient Christian writers, it remained
unknown to the scholars of Western Europe until happily discovered in the Alexandrian
manuscript. This ms. of the Sacred Scriptures (known and generally referred to as Codex
A) was presented in 1628 by Cyril, Patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I., and is now
preserved in the British Museum. Subjoined to the books of the New Testament contained
in it, there are two writings described as the Epistles of one Clement. Of these, that now
before us is the first. It is tolerably perfect, but there are many slight lacunæ, or gaps, in the
ms., and one whole leaf is supposed to have been lost towards the close. These lacunæ,
however, so numerous in some chapters, do not generally extend beyond a word or syllable,
and can for the most part be easily supplied.</p>
<p>Who the Clement was to whom these writings are ascribed, cannot with absolute certainty
be determined. The general opinion is, that he is the same as the person of that name
referred to by St. Paul (Phil. iv. 3). The writings themselves contain no statement as to their
author. The first, and by far the longer of them, simply purports to have been written in the
name of the Church at Rome to the Church at Corinth. But in the catalogue of contents
prefixed to the ms. they are both plainly attributed to one Clement; and the judgment of
most scholars is, that, in regard to the first Epistle at least, this statement is correct, and that
it is to be regarded as an authentic production of the friend and fellow-worker of St. Paul.
This belief may be traced to an early period in the history of the Church. It is found in the
writings of Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 15), of Origen (Comm. in Joan., i. 29), and others. The
internal evidence also tends to support this opinion. The doctrine, style, and manner of
thought are all in accordance with it; so that, although, as has been said, positive certainty
cannot be reached on the subject, we may with great probability conclude that we have in
this Epistle a composition of that Clement who is known to us from Scripture as having
been an associate of the great apostle.</p>
<p>The date of this Epistle has been the subject of considerable controversy. It is clear from
the writing itself that it was composed soon after some persecution (chap. i.) which the
Roman Church had endured; and the only question is, whether we are to fix upon the persecution
under Nero or Domitian. If the former, the date will be about the year 68; if the
latter, we must place it towards the close of the first century or the beginning of the second.
We possess no external aid to the settlement of this question. The lists of early Roman
bishops are in hopeless confusion, some making Clement the immediate successor of St.

<pb n="9"/>
Peter, others placing Linus, and others still Linus and Anacletus, between him and the
apostle. The internal evidence, again, leaves the matter doubtful, though it has been strongly
pressed on both sides. The probability seems, on the whole, to be in favour of the Domitian
period, so that the Epistle may be dated about a.d. 97.</p>
<p>This Epistle was held in very great esteem by the early Church. The account given of it
by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 16) is as follows: “There is one acknowledged Epistle of this
Clement (whom he has just identified with the friend of St. Paul), great and admirable,
which he wrote in the name of the Church of Rome to the Church at Corinth, sedition
having then arisen in the latter Church. We are aware that this Epistle has been publicly
read in very many churches both in old times, and also in our own day.” The Epistle before
us thus appears to have been read in numerous churches, as being almost on a level with
the canonical writings. And its place in the Alexandrian ms., immediately after the inspired
books, is in harmony with the position thus assigned it in the primitive Church. There does
indeed appear a great difference between it and the inspired writings in many respects, such
as the fanciful use sometimes made of Old-Testament statements, the fabulous stories which
are accepted by its author, and the general diffuseness and feebleness of style by which it is
distinguished. But the high tone of evangelical truth which pervades it, the simple and
earnest appeals which it makes to the heart and conscience, and the anxiety which its writer
so constantly shows to promote the best interests of the Church of Christ, still impart an
undying charm to this precious relic of later apostolic times.</p>

<p>The Church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the Church of God sojourning at Corinth,
to them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.</p>
<p>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events which have
happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention
to the points respecting which you consulted us;2 and especially to that shameful and detestable
sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident
persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name,
worthy to be universally loved, has suffered grievous injury.3 For who ever dwelt even for
a short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly
established?4 Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ?
Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice
over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of
persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the
rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young
men to be of a sober and serious mind; ye instructed your wives to do all things with a
blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye
taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs
becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.</p>

<p>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect puffed up with

to His words, ye were inwardly filled7 with His doctrine, and His sufferings were before
your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable
desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of
holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth
your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty
of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious for the whole brotherhood,8
that the number of God’s elect might be saved with mercy and a good conscience.9 Ye were
sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one another. Every kind of faction
and schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned over the transgressions of your
neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye never grudged any act of kindness,
being “ready to every good work.”10 Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life,
ye did all things in the fear of God. The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were
written upon the tablets of your hearts.11</p>

<p>Every kind of honour and happiness12 was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled
that which is written, “My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and

war and captivity. So the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation
against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced
in years. For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch
as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith,14 neither walks in
the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian,15 but walks after
his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which

<p>For thus it is written: “And it came to pass after certain days, that Cain brought of the
fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his sheep,
and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his
sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And
God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest
rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering returns
to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into
the field. And it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
his brother, and slew him.”17 Ye see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of
a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother.18
Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage.19 Envy compelled
Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his
fellow-countryman, “Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou
didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?”20 On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make
their abode without the camp.21 Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades,
through the sedition which they excited against God’s servant Moses.22 Through envy,
David underwent the hatred not only of foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of
Israel.23</p>

times. The martyrdom of Peter and Paul.</head>
<p>But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent spiritual heroes.24
Let us take the noble examples furnished in our own generation. Through envy and jealousy,
the greatest and most righteous pillars [of the Church] have been persecuted and put to
death.25 Let us set before our eyes the illustrious26 apostles. Peter, through unrighteous
envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours and when he had at length suffered
martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained
the reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into captivity,27 compelled28
to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west, he gained the illustrious
reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to
the extreme limit of the west,29 and suffered martyrdom under the prefects.30 Thus was he
removed from the world, and went into the holy place, having proved himself a striking
example of patience.</p>

<p>To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to be added a
great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy endured many indignities and tortures,
furnished us with a most excellent example. Through envy, those women, the Danaids31
and Dircæ, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments,
finished the course of their faith with stedfastness,32 and though weak in body, received a
noble reward. Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of
our father Adam, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.”33 Envy and strife

is assigned to both of us. Wherefore let us give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to
the glorious and venerable rule of our holy calling. Let us attend to what is good, pleasing,
and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us. Let us look stedfastly to the blood of
Christ, and see how precious that blood is to God,34 which, having been shed for our salvation,
has set the grace of repentance before the whole world. Let us turn to every age that
has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the Lord has granted a place of
repentance to all such as would be converted unto Him. Noah preached repentance, and as
many as listened to him were saved.35 Jonah proclaimed destruction to the Ninevites;36 but
they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God by prayer, and obtained salvation, although
they were aliens [to the covenant] of God.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Continuation respecting repentance.</head>
<p>The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of repentance; and
the Lord of all things has himself declared with an oath regarding it, “As I live, saith the
Lord, I desire not the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance;”37 adding, moreover,
this gracious declaration, “Repent, O house of Israel, of your iniquity.38 Say to the children
of My people, Though your sins reach from earth to heaven, and though they be redder39
than scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth, yet if ye turn to Me with your whole heart, and say,
Father! I will listen to you, as to a holy40 people.” And in another place He speaks thus:
“Wash you, and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before mine
eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed,
judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason
together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow;
though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if ye be willing and obey Me,
ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse, and will not hearken unto Me, the sword
shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things.”41 Desiring, therefore,
that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established
[these declarations].</p>

contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to His excellent glory. Let us take (for instance)
Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was translated, and death was
never known to happen to him.43 Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the

entered into the ark.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Continuation of the above.</head>
<p>Abraham, styled “the friend,”44 was found faithful, inasmuch as he rendered obedience
to the words of God. He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and
from his kindred, and from his father’s house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory,
and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God. For
God said to him, “Get thee out from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father’s house, into the land which I shall show thee. And I will make thee a great nation,
and will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shall be blessed. And I will bless
them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the families of the
earth be blessed.”45 And again, on his departing from Lot, God said to him. “Lift up thine
eyes, and look from the place where thou now art, northward, and southward, and eastward,
and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, [so that] if a man can number the dust of
the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.”46 And again [the Scripture] saith, “God
brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up now to heaven, and count the stars if
thou be able to number them; so shall thy seed be. And Abram believed God, and it was
counted to him for righteousness.”47 On account of his faith and hospitality, a son was
given him in his old age; and in the exercise of obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to
God on one of the mountains which He showed him.48</p>

Him to punishment and torture.49 For Lot’s wife, who went forth with him, being of a different
mind from himself and not continuing in agreement with him [as to the command
which had been given them], was made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this
day.50 This was done that all might know that those who are of a double mind, and who

<head>Chapter XII.—The rewards of faith and hospitality. Rahab.</head>
<p>On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved. For when spies
were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the king of the country ascertained that
they were come to spy out their land, and sent men to seize them, in order that, when taken,
they might be put to death. But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on
the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived
and said “There came men unto thee who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so
the king commands,” she answered them, “The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but
quickly departed again and are gone,” thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said
to the men, “I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for the fear
and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep
ye me and the house of my father in safety.” And they said to her, “It shall be as thou hast
spoken to us. As soon, therefore, as thou knowest that we are at hand, thou shalt gather all
thy family under thy roof, and they shall be preserved, but all that are found outside of thy
dwelling shall perish.”52 Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect, that she should hang
forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus they made it manifest that redemption
should flow through the blood of the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God.53 Ye
see, beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy, in this woman.</p>

Holy Spirit saith, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man
glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory
in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness”54), being
especially mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus which He spake, teaching us meekness
and long-suffering. For thus He spoke: “Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive,
that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye
be judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete,
with the same it shall be measured to you.”55 By this precept and by these rules let us establish
ourselves, that we walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word
saith, “On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembleth at
My words?”56</p>

we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the
inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what
is good. Let us be kind one to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity
of our Creator. For it is written, “The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the guiltless
shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed from off the face of it.”57 And again
[the Scripture] saith, “I saw the ungodly highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon:

find it. Preserve innocence, and look on equity: for there shall be a remnant to the peaceful

<head>Chapter XVI.—Christ as an example of humility.</head>
<p>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves
over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in
the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition,
as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, “Lord, who hath believed our
report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared [our message] in
His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor
glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without
eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed
to stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance
was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in
sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was exposed to labour,
and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our
iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed.
All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord
has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His
mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb,
so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall
declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the transgressions of my
people was He brought down to death. And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and
the rich for His death,65 because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth.
And the Lord is pleased to purify Him by stripes.66 If ye make67 an offering for sin, your
soul shall see a long-lived seed. And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the affliction of
His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding,68 to justify the Just One
who ministereth well to many; and He Himself shall carry their sins. On this account He
shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered
to death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and
for their sins was He delivered.”69 And again He saith, “I am a worm, and no man; a reproach
of men, and despised of the people. All that see Me have derided Me; they have spoken with

declared, “I am but dust and ashes.”72 Moreover, it is thus written of Job, “Job was a righteous
man, and blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all evil.”73 But
bringing an accusation against himself, he said, “No man is free from defilement, even if
his life be but of one day.”74 Moses was called faithful in all God’s house;75 and through his
instrumentality, God punished Egypt76 with plagues and tortures. Yet he, though thus
greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty language, but said, when the divine oracle came to
him out of the bush, “Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am a man of a feeble voice and a
slow tongue.”77 And again he said, “I am but as the smoke of a pot.”78</p>

in everlasting mercy have I anointed him?”80 Yet this very man saith to God, “Have mercy
on me, O Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions,
blot out my transgression. Wash me still more from mine iniquity, and cleanse
me from my sin. For I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee
only have I sinned, and done that which was evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be justified
in Thy sayings, and mayest overcome when Thou81 art judged. For, behold, I was conceived
in transgressions, and in my sins did my mother conceive me. For, behold, Thou hast loved
truth; the secret and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou shown me. Thou shalt sprinkle me
with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; my bones, which have been humbled, shall
exult. Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a
clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.82 Cast me not away from Thy presence,
and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and
establish me by Thy governing Spirit. I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly
shall be converted unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,83 O God, the God of my
salvation: my tongue shall exult in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open my mouth,
and my lips shall show forth Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have
given it; Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The sacrifice [acceptable] to God is a
bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.”84</p>

with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His command, within their
prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The fruitful earth, according to His will, brings
forth food in abundance, at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings
upon it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed. The unsearchable
places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the lower world, are
restrained by the same laws. The vast unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working
into various basins,86 never passes beyond the bounds placed around it, but does as He has
commanded. For He said, “Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall be broken within
thee.”87 The ocean, impassable to man, and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same
enactments of the Lord. The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully
give place to one another. The winds in their several quarters88 fulfill, at the proper time,
their service without hindrance. The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment
and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men. The very smallest of living
beings meet together in peace and concord. All these the great Creator and Lord of all has
appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while He does good to all, but most abundantly
to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom
be glory and majesty for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. [For

are good and well-pleasing in His sight. For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, “The
Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly.”89 Let us reflect how
near He is, and that none of the thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from
Him. It is right, therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us.
Let us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who
glory in the pride of their speech, than [offend] God. Let us reverence the Lord Jesus Christ,
whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the rule over us;90 let us honour
the aged91 among us; let us train up the young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives
to that which is good. Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity [in all their conduct]; let
them show forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make manifest the command
which they have of their tongue, by their manner92 of speaking; let them display their love,
not by preferring93 one to another, but by showing equal affection to all that piously fear
God. Let your children be partakers of true Christian training; let them learn of how great

excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those who walk in94 it with a pure mind.

“Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and of a doubting heart; who say, These

none of them has happened unto us.”98 Ye foolish ones! compare yourselves to a tree: take

and then it flowers; after that comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit. Ye

<p>Let us consider that wonderful sign [of the resurrection] which takes place in Eastern
lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round about. There is a certain bird which is called
a phoenix. This is the only one of its kind, and lives five hundred years. And when the time
of its dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh,
and other spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as the flesh
decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the dead
bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up that nest in which
are the bones of its parent, and bearing these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt,
to the city called Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places them
on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its former abode. The priests
then inspect the registers of the dates, and find that it has returned exactly as the five hundredth
year was completed.103</p>

gifts which were given by him.129 For from him130 have sprung the priests and all the Levites
who minister at the altar of God. From him also [was descended] our Lord Jesus Christ according
to the flesh.131 From him [arose] kings, princes, and rulers of the race of Judah.
Nor are his other tribes in small glory, inasmuch as God had promised, “Thy seed shall be
as the stars of heaven.”132 All these, therefore, were highly honoured, and made great, not
for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought,
but through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will in Christ Jesus,
are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or
works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from
the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—But let us not give up the practice of good works and love.
God Himself is an example to us of good works.</head>
<p>What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and cease
from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be followed by us! But
rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. For
the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His infinitely great power
He established the heavens, and by His incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He
also divided the earth from the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immoveable
foundation of His own will. The animals also which are upon it He commanded by His own
word133 into existence. So likewise, when He had formed the sea, and the living creatures
which are in it, He enclosed them [within their proper bounds] by His own power. Above
all,134 with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent [of His
creatures], and truly great through the understanding given him— the express likeness of
His own image. For thus says God: “Let us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness.
So God made man; male and female He created them.”135 Having thus finished all these
things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said, “Increase and multiply.”136 We
see,137 then, how all righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord
Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let
us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our
whole strength.</p>

<p>The good servant138 receives the bread of his labour with confidence; the lazy and
slothful cannot look his employer in the face. It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt
in the practice of well-doing; for of Him are all things. And thus He forewarns us: “Behold,
the Lord [cometh], and His reward is before His face, to render to every man according to
his work.”139 He exhorts us, therefore, with our whole heart to attend to this,140 that we be
not lazy or slothful in any good work. Let our boasting and our confidence be in Him. Let
us submit ourselves to His will. Let us consider the whole multitude of His angels, how they
stand ever ready to minister to His will. For the Scripture saith, “Ten thousand times ten
thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto Him,141 and
cried, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord of Sabaoth; the whole creation is full of His glory.”142
And let us therefore, conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him earnestly,
as with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His great and glorious promises. For
[the Scripture] saith, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
of man, the things which He hath prepared for them that wait for Him.”143</p>

<p>How blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in immortality, splendour
in righteousness, truth in perfect confidence,144 faith in assurance, self-control in holiness!
And all these fall under the cognizance of our understandings [now]; what then shall those
things be which are prepared for such as wait for Him? The Creator and Father of all
worlds,145 the Most Holy, alone knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore
earnestly strive to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we may
share in His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be
fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are pleasing and acceptable
to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow
the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness,
strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride
and haughtiness, vainglory and ambition.146 For they that do such things are hateful to
God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take pleasure in them that do
them.147 For the Scripture saith, “But to the sinner God said, Wherefore dost thou declare
my statutes, and take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction, and
castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with148 him,
and didst make thy portion with adulterers. Thy mouth has abounded with wickedness, and
thy tongue contrived149 deceit. Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother; thou
slanderest150 thine own mother’s son. These things thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou
thoughtest, wicked one, that I should be like to thyself. But I will reprove thee, and set thyself
before thee. Consider now these things, ye that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, like

commanded us to perform at stated times.174 He has enjoined offerings [to be presented]

appointed times and hours. Where and by whom He desires these things to be done, He
Himself has fixed by His own supreme will, in order that all things being piously done according
to His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him.175 Those, therefore, who present
their offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as they follow

appointed those [ministers] before mentioned, when the blessed Moses also, “a faithful
servant in all his house,”185 noted down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were
given him, and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one consent
to the ordinances which he had appointed? For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood,
and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned
with that glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their
rods, each one being inscribed with the name186 of the tribe. And he took them and bound
them [together], and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them
up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of the tabernacle,
he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren, the
tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to
minister unto Him. And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred
thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle
of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have
blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it.187 What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses know beforehand

Spirit. Observe193 that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.
There194 you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men who themselves were
holy. The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked. They were cast into
prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain,
but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them.
Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren?
Was Daniel195 cast into the den of lions by such as feared God? Were Ananias, and Azarias,
and Mishael shut up in a furnace196 of fire by those who observed197 the great and glorious
worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were they that did
such things? The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of

when the Gospel first began to be preached?211 Truly, under the inspiration212 of the Spirit,
he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos,213 because even then parties214
had been formed among you. But that inclination for one above another entailed less guilt
upon you, inasmuch as your partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high
reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect who those are
that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your far-famed brotherly love. It is
disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian profession,215
that such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient Church of the
Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons, engage in sedition against its presbyters.
And this rumour has reached not only us, but those also who are unconnected216 with
us; so that, through your infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger is
also brought upon yourselves.</p>

<p>Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end217 to this [state of things]; and let us fall down
before the Lord, and beseech Him with tears, that He would mercifully218 be reconciled to
us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love. For [such conduct]
is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the attainment of life, as it is written,
“Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord: this
is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by it.”219 Although, therefore, many gates
have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in Christ by which blessed are
all they that have entered in and have directed their way in holiness and righteousness, doing
all things without disorder. Let a man be faithful: let him be powerful in the utterance of
knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the more
he seems to be superior to others [in these respects], the more humble-minded ought he to
be, and to seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIX.—The praise of love.</head>
<p>Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can describe
the [blessed] bond of the love of God? What man is able to tell the excellence of its beauty,
as it ought to be told? The height to which love exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to God.
Love covers a multitude of sins.220 Love beareth all things, is long-suffering in all things.221
There is nothing base, nothing arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise
to no seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect of God been made
perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God. In love has the Lord taken us to
Himself. On account of the Love he bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by
the will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.222</p>

<p>Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that there is no declaring
its perfection. Who is fit to be found in it, except such as God has vouchsafed to render so?
Let us pray, therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live blameless in love, free
from all human partialities for one above another. All the generations from Adam even
unto this day have passed away; but those who, through the grace of God, have been made
perfect in love, now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the
revelation223 of the kingdom of Christ. For it is written, “Enter into thy secret chambers for
a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will remember a propitious224 day,
and will raise you up out of your graves.”225 Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments
of God in the harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be forgiven
us. For it is written, “Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are
covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth
there is no guile.”226 This blessedness cometh upon those who have been chosen by God
through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

should acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts
of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of God, and whose
condemnation was made manifest [unto all]. For they went down alive into Hades, and
death swallowed them up.229 Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt, and the
chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red Sea, and perished,230 for no

Moses went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days
and forty nights, the Lord said unto him, “Moses, Moses, get thee down quickly from hence;
for thy people whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity.
They have speedily departed from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have
made to themselves molten images.”235 And the Lord said unto him, “I have spoken to thee
once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people: let
Me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make thee a great
and wonderful nation, and one much more numerous than this.”236 But Moses said, “Far
be it from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out of the book of the
living.”237 O marvellous238 love! O insuperable perfection! The servant speaks freely to his
Lord, and asks forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might perish239 along with
them.</p>

<head>Chapter LV.—Examples of such love.</head>
<p>To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and princes, in
times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up
to death, in order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens [from
destruction]. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought
to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to
bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to
slavery, that with the price243 which they received for themselves, they might provide food
for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed
numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders
permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she
went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord
delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.244 Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed
herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction.
For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who seeth all
things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake
she had encountered peril.245.</p>

<head>Chapter LVI.—Let us admonish and correct one another.</head>
<p>Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that meekness and humility
may be given to them, so that they may submit, not unto us, but to the will of God. For in
this way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for
them, both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the saints.246 Let us receive
correction, beloved, on account of which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations
by which we admonish one another are both good [in themselves] and highly profitable,
for they tend to unite247 us to the will of God. For thus saith the holy Word: “The Lord hath
severely chastened me, yet hath not given me over to death.”248 “For whom the Lord loveth
He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”249 “The righteous,” saith it,
“shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of sinners make fat my
head.”250 And again he saith, “Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not
thou the warning of the Almighty. For He causes sorrow, and again restores [to gladness];
He woundeth, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in the
seventh no evil shall touch thee. In famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He
shall free thee from the power251 of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue will He hide
thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh. Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the
wicked, and shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the field. For the wild beasts shall be at peace
with thee: then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the habitation of thy
tabernacle shall not fail.252 Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thy children
like the grass of the field. And thou shall come to the grave like ripened corn which is reaped
in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered together at the proper
time.”253 Ye see, beloved, that protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord;
for since God is good, He corrects us, that we may be admonished by His holy chastisement.</p>

sudden confusion overtakes you, when overturning presents itself like a tempest, or when
tribulation and oppression fall upon you. For it shall come to pass, that when ye call upon
Me, I will not hear you; the wicked shall seek Me, and they shall not find Me. For they hated
wisdom, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to My counsels, but

<pb n="72"/>
<head>Introductory Note to the Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus</head>
<p>[a.d. 130.] The anonymous author of this Epistle gives himself the title (Mathetes) “a
disciple1 of the Apostles,” and I venture to adopt it as his name. It is about all we know of
him, and it serves a useful end. I place his letter here, as a sequel to the Clementine Epistle,
for several reasons, which I think scholars will approve: (1) It is full of the Pauline spirit,
and exhales the same pure and primitive fragrance which is characteristic of Clement. (2)
No theory as to its date very much conflicts with that which I adopt, and it is sustained by
good authorities. (3) But, as a specimen of the persuasives against Gentilism which early
Christians employed in their intercourse with friends who adhered to heathenism, it admirably
illustrates the temper prescribed by St. Paul (2 Tim. ii. 24), and not less the peculiar
social relations of converts to the Gospel with the more amiable and candid of their personal
friends at this early period.</p>
<p>Mathetes was possibly a catechumen of St. Paul or of one of the apostle’s associates. I
assume that his correspondent was the tutor of M. Aurelius. Placed just here, it fills a lacuna
in the series, and takes the place of the pseudo (second) Epistle of Clement, which is now
relegated to its proper place with the works falsely ascribed to St. Clement.</p>
<p>Altogether, the Epistle is a gem of purest ray; and, while suggesting some difficulties as
to interpretation and exposition, it is practically clear as to argument and intent. Mathetes
is, perhaps, the first of the apologists.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice of the learned editors and translators:—</p>
<p>The following interesting and eloquent Epistle is anonymous, and we have no clue
whatever as to its author. For a considerable period after its publication in 1592, it was
generally ascribed to Justin Martyr. In recent times Otto has inserted it among the works
of that writer, but Semisch and others contend that it cannot possibly be his. In dealing with
this question, we depend entirely upon the internal evidence, no statement as to the authorship
of the Epistle having descended to us from antiquity. And it can scarcely be denied that
the whole tone of the Epistle, as well as special passages which it contains, points to some
other writer than Justin. Accordingly, critics are now for the most part agreed that it is not
his, and that it must be ascribed to one who lived at a still earlier date in the history of the
Church. Several internal arguments have been brought forward in favour of this opinion.
Supposing chap. xi. to be genuine, it has been supported by the fact that the writer there
styles himself “a disciple of the apostles.” But there is great suspicion that the two concluding
<note type="footnote">1 ἀποστόλων γενόμενος μαθητης. Cap. xi.</note>

<pb n="73"/>
chapters are spurious; and even though admitted to be genuine, the expression quoted
evidently admits of a different explanation from that which implies the writer’s personal
acquaintance with the apostles: it might, indeed, be adopted by one even at the present day.
More weight is to be attached to those passages in which the writer speaks of Christianity
as still being a new thing in the world. Expressions to this effect occur in several places (chap.
i., ii., ix.), and seem to imply that the author lived very little, if at all, after the apostolic age.
There is certainly nothing in the Epistle which is inconsistent with this opinion; and we may
therefore believe, that in this beautiful composition we possess a genuine production of
some apostolic man who lived not later than the beginning of the second century.</p>
<p>The names of Clement of Rome and of Apollos have both been suggested as those of
the probable author. Such opinions, however, are pure fancies, which it is perhaps impossible
to refute, but which rest on nothing more than conjecture. Nor can a single word be said as
to the person named Diognetus, to whom the letter is addressed. We must be content to
leave both points in hopeless obscurity, and simply accept the Epistle as written by an
earnest and intelligent Christian to a sincere inquirer among the Gentiles, towards the close
of the apostolic age.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that the text is often so very doubtful. Only three mss. of the
Epistle, all probably exhibiting the same original text, are known to exist; and in not a few
passages the readings are, in consequence, very defective and obscure. But notwithstanding
this drawback, and the difficulty of representing the full force and elegance of the original,
this Epistle, as now presented to the English reader, can hardly fail to excite both his deepest
interest and admiration.</p>
<p>[N.B.—Interesting speculations concerning this precious work may be seen in Bunsen’s
Hippolytus and his Age, vol. i. p. 188. The learned do not seem convinced by this author,
but I have adopted his suggestion as to Diognetus the tutor of M. Aurelius.]</p>

<p>Since I see thee, most excellent Diognetus, exceedingly desirous to learn the mode of
worshipping God prevalent among the Christians, and inquiring very carefully and earnestly
concerning them, what God they trust in, and what form of religion they observe,2 so as all
to look down upon the world itself, and despise death, while they neither esteem those to
be gods that are reckoned such by the Greeks, nor hold to the superstition of the Jews; and
what is the affection which they cherish among themselves; and why, in fine, this new kind
or practice [of piety] has only now entered into the world,3 and not long ago; I cordially
welcome this thy desire, and I implore God, who enables us both to speak and to hear, to
grant to me so to speak, that, above all, I may hear you have been edified,4 and to you so to
hear, that I who speak may have no cause of regret for having done so.</p>

which needs a man to watch it, lest it be stolen? Is not a fifth iron, consumed by rust? Is not
a sixth earthenware, in no degree more valuable than that which is formed for the humblest
purposes? Are not all these of corruptible matter? Are they not fabricated by means of iron
and fire? Did not the sculptor fashion one of them, the brazier a second, the silversmith a
third, and the potter a fourth? Was not every one of them, before they were formed by the
arts of these [workmen] into the shape of these [gods], each in its9 own way subject to
change? Would not those things which are now vessels, formed of the same materials, become
like to such, if they met with the same artificers? Might not these, which are now worshipped

ye hate the Christians, because they do not deem these to be gods. But do not ye yourselves,

they [the Christians do]? Do ye not much more mock and insult them, when ye worship
those that are made of stone and earthenware, without appointing any persons to guard

after them by day, lest they be stolen? And by those gifts which ye mean to present to them,
do ye not, if they are possessed of sense, rather punish [than honour] them? But if, on the
other hand, they are destitute of sense, ye convict them of this fact, while ye worship them
with blood and the smoke of sacrifices. Let any one of you suffer such indignities!10 Let any

<head>Chapter III.—Superstitions of the Jews.</head>
<p>And next, I imagine that you are most desirous of hearing something on this point, that
the Christians do not observe the same forms of divine worship as do the Jews. The Jews,
then, if they abstain from the kind of service above described, and deem it proper to worship
one God as being Lord of all, [are right]; but if they offer Him worship in the way which we
have described, they greatly err. For while the Gentiles, by offering such things to those that
are destitute of sense and hearing, furnish an example of madness; they, on the other hand,
by thinking to offer these things to God as if He needed them, might justly reckon it rather
an act of folly than of divine worship. For He that made heaven and earth, and all that is
therein, and gives to us all the things of which we stand in need, certainly requires none of
those things which He Himself bestows on such as think of furnishing them to Him. But
those who imagine that, by means of blood, and the smoke of sacrifices and burnt-offerings,
they offer sacrifices [acceptable] to Him, and that by such honours they show Him respect,
—these, by12 supposing that they can give anything to Him who stands in need of nothing,
appear to me in no respect to differ from those who studiously confer the same honour on
things destitute of sense, and which therefore are unable to enjoy such honours.</p>

<p>But as to their scrupulosity concerning meats, and their superstition as respects the
Sabbaths, and their boasting about circumcision, and their fancies about fasting and the
new moons, which are utterly ridiculous and unworthy of notice,—I do not13 think that
you require to learn anything from me. For, to accept some of those things which have been
formed by God for the use of men as properly formed, and to reject others as useless and
redundant,—how can this be lawful? And to speak falsely of God, as if He forbade us to do
what is good on the Sabbath-days,—how is not this impious? And to glory in the circumcision14
of the flesh as a proof of election, and as if, on account of it, they were specially
beloved by God,—how is it not a subject of ridicule? And as to their observing months and
days,15 as if waiting upon16 the stars and the moon, and their distributing,17 according to
their own tendencies, the appointments of God, and the vicissitudes of the seasons, some
for festivities,18 and others for mourning,—who would deem this a part of divine worship,
and not much rather a manifestation of folly? I suppose, then, you are sufficiently convinced
that the Christians properly abstain from the vanity and error common [to both Jews and
Gentiles], and from the busy-body spirit and vain boasting of the Jews; but you must not
hope to learn the mystery of their peculiar mode of worshipping God from any mortal.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The manners of the Christians.</head>
<p>For the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language,
nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit cities of their own, nor employ
a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is marked out by any singularity. The course
of conduct which they follow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation of
inquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim themselves the advocates of any merely
human doctrines. But, inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian cities, according as the lot of
each of them has determined, and following the customs of the natives in respect to clothing,
food, and the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their wonderful and confessedly
striking19 method of life. They dwell in their own countries, but simply as sojourners.
As citizens, they share in all things with others, and yet endure all things as if foreigners.
Every foreign land is to them as their native country, and every land of their birth as a land
of strangers. They marry, as do all [others]; they beget children; but they do not destroy
their offspring.20 They have a common table, but not a common bed.21 They are in the
flesh, but they do not live after the flesh.22 They pass their days on earth, but they are citizens
of heaven.23 They obey the prescribed laws, and at the same time surpass the laws by their
lives. They love all men, and are persecuted by all. They are unknown and condemned; they
are put to death, and restored to life.24 They are poor, yet make many rich;25 they are in
lack of all things, and yet abound in all; they are dishonoured, and yet in their very dishonour
are glorified. They are evil spoken of, and yet are justified; they are reviled, and bless;26 they
are insulted, and repay the insult with honour; they do good, yet are punished as evil-doers.
When punished, they rejoice as if quickened into life; they are assailed by the Jews as foreigners,
and are persecuted by the Greeks; yet those who hate them are unable to assign any
reason for their hatred.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The relation of Christians to the world.</head>
<p>To sum up all in one word—what the soul is in the body, that are Christians in the
world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered
through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, yet is not of the body; and
Christians dwell in the world, yet are not of the world.27 The invisible soul is guarded by
the visible body, and Christians are known indeed to be in the world, but their godliness
remains invisible. The flesh hates the soul, and wars against it,28 though itself suffering no
injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also hates the Christians,
though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates
it, and [loves also] the members; Christians likewise love those that hate them. The soul is
imprisoned in the body, yet preserves29 that very body; and Christians are confined in the
world as in a prison, and yet they are the preservers30 of the world. The immortal soul dwells
in a mortal tabernacle; and Christians dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking
for an incorruptible dwelling31 in the heavens. The soul, when but ill-provided with food
and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the Christians, though subjected day by day to
punishment, increase the more in number.32 God has assigned them this illustrious position,
which it were unlawful for them to forsake.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The manifestation of Christ.</head>
<p>For, as I said, this was no mere earthly invention which was delivered to them, nor is it
a mere human system of opinion, which they judge it right to preserve so carefully, nor has
a dispensation of mere human mysteries been committed to them, but truly God Himself,
who is almighty, the Creator of all things, and invisible, has sent from heaven, and placed
among men, [Him who is] the truth, and the holy and incomprehensible Word, and has
firmly established Him in their hearts. He did not, as one might have imagined, send to men
any servant, or angel, or ruler, or any one of those who bear sway over earthly things, or
one of those to whom the government of things in the heavens has been entrusted, but the
very Creator and Fashioner of all things—by whom He made the heavens—by whom he
enclosed the sea within its proper bounds—whose ordinances33 all the stars34 faithfully
observe—from whom the sun35 has received the measure of his daily course to be observed36—
whom the moon obeys, being commanded to shine in the night, and whom the
stars also obey, following the moon in her course; by whom all things have been arranged,
and placed within their proper limits, and to whom all are subject—the heavens and the
things that are therein, the earth and the things that are therein, the sea and the things that
are therein—fire, air, and the abyss—the things which are in the heights, the things which
are in the depths, and the things which lie between. This [messenger] He sent to them. Was
it then, as one37 might conceive, for the purpose of exercising tyranny, or of inspiring fear
and terror? By no means, but under the influence of clemency and meekness. As a king
sends his son, who is also a king, so sent He Him; as God38 He sent Him; as to men He sent
Him; as a Saviour He sent Him, and as seeking to persuade, not to compel us; for violence
has no place in the character of God. As calling us He sent Him, not as vengefully pursuing
us; as loving us He sent Him, not as judging us. For He will yet send Him to judge us, and
who shall endure His appearing?39 … Do you not see them exposed to wild beasts, that
they may be persuaded to deny the Lord, and yet not overcome? Do you not see that the
more of them are punished, the greater becomes the number of the rest? This does not seem
to be the work of man: this is the power of God; these are the evidences of His manifestation.</p>

<p>For, who of men at all understood before His coming what God is? Do you accept of
the vain and silly doctrines of those who are deemed trustworthy philosophers? of whom
some said that fire was God, calling that God to which they themselves were by and by to
come; and some water; and others some other of the elements formed by God. But if any
one of these theories be worthy of approbation, every one of the rest of created things might
also be declared to be God. But such declarations are simply the startling and erroneous
utterances of deceivers;40 and no man has either seen Him, or made Him known,41 but He
has revealed Himself. And He has manifested Himself through faith, to which alone it is
given to behold God. For God, the Lord and Fashioner of all things, who made all things,
and assigned them their several positions, proved Himself not merely a friend of mankind,
but also long-suffering [in His dealings with them]. Yea, He was always of such a character,
and still is, and will ever be, kind and good, and free from wrath, and true, and the only one
who is [absolutely] good;42 and He formed in His mind a great and unspeakable conception,
which He communicated to His Son alone. As long, then, as He held and preserved His own
wise counsel in concealment,43 He appeared to neglect us, and to have no care over us. But
after He revealed and laid open, through His beloved Son, the things which had been prepared
from the beginning, He conferred every blessing44 all at once upon us, so that we should
both share in His benefits, and see and be active45 [in His service]. Who of us would ever
have expected these things? He was aware, then, of all things in His own mind, along with

<head>Chapter IX.—Why the Son was sent so late.</head>
<p>As long then as the former time47 endured, He permitted us to be borne along by unruly
impulses, being drawn away by the desire of pleasure and various lusts. This was not that
He at all delighted in our sins, but that He simply endured them; nor that He approved the
time of working iniquity which then was, but that He sought to form a mind conscious of
righteousness,48 so that being convinced in that time of our unworthiness of attaining life
through our own works, it should now, through the kindness of God, be vouchsafed to us;
and having made it manifest that in ourselves we were unable to enter into the kingdom of
God, we might through the power of God be made able. But when our wickedness had
reached its height, and it had been clearly shown that its reward,49 punishment and death,
was impending over us; and when the time had come which God had before appointed for
manifesting His own kindness and power, how50 the one love of God, through exceeding
regard for men, did not regard us with hatred, nor thrust us away, nor remember our iniquity
against us, but showed great long-suffering, and bore with us,51 He Himself took on Him
the burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the holy One for
transgressors, the blameless One for the wicked, the righteous One for the unrighteous, the
incorruptible One for the corruptible, the immortal One for them that are mortal. For what
other thing was capable of covering our sins than His righteousness? By what other one was
it possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be justified, than by the only Son of God?
O sweet exchange! O unsearchable operation! O benefits surpassing all expectation! that
the wickedness of many should be hid in a single righteous One, and that the righteousness
of One should justify many transgressors!52 Having therefore convinced us in the former
time53 that our nature was unable to attain to life, and having now revealed the Saviour who
is able to save even those things which it was [formerly] impossible to save, by both these
facts He desired to lead us to trust in His kindness, to esteem Him our Nourisher, Father,
Teacher, Counsellor, Healer, our Wisdom, Light, Honour, Glory, Power, and Life, so that
we should not be anxious54 concerning clothing and food.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The blessings that will flow from faith.</head>
<p>If you also desire [to possess] this faith, you likewise shall receive first of all the knowledge
of the Father.55 For God has loved mankind, on whose account He made the world, to whom
He rendered subject all the things that are in it,56 to whom He gave reason and understanding,
to whom alone He imparted the privilege of looking upwards to Himself, whom He
formed after His own image, to whom He sent His only-begotten Son, to whom He has
promised a kingdom in heaven, and will give it to those who have loved Him. And when
you have attained this knowledge, with what joy do you think you will be filled? Or, how
will you love Him who has first so loved you? And if you love Him, you will be an imitator
of His kindness. And do not wonder that a man may become an imitator of God. He can,
if he is willing. For it is not by ruling over his neighbours, or by seeking to hold the supremacy
over those that are weaker, or by being rich, and showing violence towards those that are
inferior, that happiness is found; nor can any one by these things become an imitator of
God. But these things do not at all constitute His majesty. On the contrary he who takes
upon himself the burden of his neighbour; he who, in whatsoever respect he may be superior,
is ready to benefit another who is deficient; he who, whatsoever things he has received
from God, by distributing these to the needy, becomes a god to those who receive [his benefits]:
he is an imitator of God. Then thou shalt see, while still on earth, that God in the
heavens rules over [the universe]; then thou shall begin to speak the mysteries of God; then
shalt thou both love and admire those that suffer punishment because they will not deny
God; then shall thou condemn the deceit and error of the world when thou shall know what
it is to live truly in heaven, when thou shalt despise that which is here esteemed to be death,
when thou shalt fear what is truly death, which is reserved for those who shall be condemned
to the eternal fire, which shall afflict those even to the end that are committed to it. Then
shalt thou admire those who for righteousness’ sake endure the fire that is but for a moment,
and shalt count them happy when thou shalt know [the nature of] that fire.</p>

the things which have been clearly shown by the Word to His disciples, to whom the Word
being manifested has revealed them, speaking plainly [to them], not understood indeed by
the unbelieving, but conversing with the disciples, who, being esteemed faithful by Him,
acquired a knowledge of the mysteries of the Father? For which59 reason He sent the Word,
that He might be manifested to the world; and He, being despised by the people [of the
Jews], was, when preached by the Apostles, believed on by the Gentiles.60 This is He who
was from the beginning, who appeared as if new, and was found old, and yet who is ever
born afresh in the hearts of the saints. This is He who, being from everlasting, is to-day
called61 the Son; through whom the Church is enriched, and grace, widely spread, increases
in the saints, furnishing understanding, revealing mysteries, announcing times, rejoicing
over the faithful, giving62 to those that seek, by whom the limits of faith are not broken
through, nor the boundaries set by the fathers passed over. Then the fear of the law is chanted,
and the grace of the prophets is known, and the faith of the gospels is established, and the

<head>Chapter XII.—The importance of knowledge to true spiritual life.</head>
<p>When you have read and carefully listened to these things, you shall know what God
bestows on such as rightly love Him, being made [as ye are] a paradise of delight, presenting63
in yourselves a tree bearing all kinds of produce and flourishing well, being adorned with
various fruits. For in this place64 the tree of knowledge and the tree of life have been planted;
but it is not the tree of knowledge that destroys— it is disobedience that proves destructive.
Nor truly are those words without significance which are written, how God from the beginning
planted the tree of life in the midst of paradise, revealing through knowledge the way
to life,65 and when those who were first formed did not use this [knowledge] properly, they
were, through the fraud of the Serpent, stripped naked.66 For neither can life exist without
knowledge, nor is knowledge secure without life. Wherefore both were planted close together.
The Apostle, perceiving the force [of this conjunction], and blaming that knowledge which,
without true doctrine, is admitted to influence life,67 declares, “Knowledge puffeth up, but
love edifieth.” For he who thinks he knows anything without true knowledge, and such as
is witnessed to by life, knows nothing, but is deceived by the Serpent, as not68 loving life.
But he who combines knowledge with fear, and seeks after life, plants in hope, looking for
fruit. Let your heart be your wisdom; and let your life be true knowledge69 inwardly received.
Bearing this tree and displaying its fruit, thou shalt always gather70 in those things which
are desired by God, which the Serpent cannot reach, and to which deception does not approach;
nor is Eve then corrupted,71 but is trusted as a virgin; and salvation is manifested,
and the Apostles are filled with understanding, and the Passover72 of the Lord advances,
and the choirs73 are gathered together, and are arranged in proper order, and the Word
rejoices in teaching the saints,—by whom the Father is glorified: to whom be glory for ever.

<pb n="89"/>
<head>Introductory Note to the Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians</head>
<p>[a.d. 65–100–155.] The Epistle of Polycarp is usually made a sort of preface to those of
Ignatius, for reasons which will be obvious to the reader. Yet he was born later, and lived
to a much later period. They seem to have been friends from the days of their common pupilage
under St. John; and there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher, that he
was the “angel of the church in Smyrna,” to whom the Master says, “Be thou faithful unto
death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” His pupil Irenæus gives us one of the very few
portraits of an apostolic man which are to be found in antiquity, in a few sentences which
are a picture: “I could describe the very place in which the blessed Polycarp sat and taught;
his going out and coming in; the whole tenor of his life; his personal appearance; how he
would speak of the conversations he had held with John and with others who had seen the
Lord. How did he make mention of their words and of whatever he had heard from them
respecting the Lord.” Thus he unconsciously tantalizes our reverent curiosity. Alas! that
such conversations were not written for our learning. But there is a wise Providence in what
is withheld, as well as in the inestimable treasures we have received.</p>
<p>Irenæus will tell us more concerning him, his visit to Rome, his rebuke of Marcion, and
incidental anecdotes, all which are instructive. The expression which he applied to Marcion
is found in this Epistle. Other facts of interest are found in the Martyrdom, which follows
in these pages. His death, in extreme old age under the first of the Antonines, has been
variously dated; but we may accept the date we have given, as rendered probable by that of
the Paschal question, which he so lovingly settled with Anicetus, Bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Philippians is the more interesting as denoting the state of that beloved
church, the firstborn of European churches, and so greatly endeared to St. Paul. It abounds
in practical wisdom, and is rich in Scripture and Scriptural allusions. It reflects the spirit of
St. John, alike in its lamb-like and its aquiline features: he is as loving as the beloved disciple
himself when he speaks of Christ and his church, but “the son of thunder” is echoed in his
rebukes of threatened corruptions in faith and morals. Nothing can be more clear than his
view of the doctrines of grace; but he writes like the disciple of St. John, though in perfect
harmony with St. Paul’s hymn-like eulogy of Christian love.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The authenticity of the following Epistle can on no fair grounds be questioned. It is
abundantly established by external testimony, and is also supported by the internal evidence.
Irenæus says (Adv. Hær., iii. 3): “There is extant an Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians,
most satisfactory, from which those that have a mind to do so may learn the character

<pb n="90"/>
of his faith,” etc. This passage is embodied by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History (iv. 14);
and in another place the same writer refers to the Epistle before us as an undoubted production
of Polycarp (Hist. Eccl., iii. 36). Other ancient testimonies might easily be added, but
are superfluous, inasmuch as there is a general consent among scholars at the present day
that we have in this letter an authentic production of the renowned Bishop of Smyrna.</p>
<p>Of Polycarp’s life little is known, but that little is highly interesting. Irenæus was his
disciple, and tells us that “Polycarp was instructed by the apostles, and was brought into
contact with many who had seen Christ” (Adv. Hær., iii. 3; Euseb. Hist. Eccl., iv. 14). There
is also a very graphic account given of Polycarp by Irenæus in his Epistle to Florinus, to
which the reader is referred. It has been preserved by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., v. 20).</p>
<p>The Epistle before us is not perfect in any of the Greek mss. which contain it. But the
chapters wanting in Greek are contained in an ancient Latin version. While there is no
ground for supposing, as some have done, that the whole Epistle is spurious, there seems
considerable force in the arguments by which many others have sought to prove chap. xiii.
to be an interpolation.</p>
<p>The date of the Epistle cannot be satisfactorily determined. It depends on the conclusion
we reach as to some points, very difficult and obscure, connected with that account of the
martyrdom of Polycarp which has come down to us. We shall not, however, probably be
far wrong if we fix it about the middle of the second century.</p>

<p>These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I take
anything upon myself, but because ye have invited me to do so. For neither I, nor any other
such one, can come up to the wisdom21 of the blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among
you, accurately and stedfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were
then alive. And when absent from you, he wrote you a letter,22 which, if you carefully study,
you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith which has been given you, and
which, being followed by hope, and preceded by love towards God, and Christ, and our
neighbour, “is the mother of us all.”23 For if any one be inwardly possessed of these graces,
he hath fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that hath love is far from all sin.</p>

<p>Knowing, then, that “God is not mocked,”29 we ought to walk worthy of His commandment

righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ,30 and not of men. They must not
be slanderers, double-tongued,31 or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, compassionate,
industrious, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the servant32 of
all. If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according
as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live33
worthily of Him, “we shall also reign together with Him,”34 provided only we believe. In
like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to
preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it
is well that they should be cut off from35 the lusts that are in the world, since “every lust
warreth against the spirit;”36 and “neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,”37 nor those who do things
inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being
subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. The virgins also must walk
in a blameless and pure conscience.</p>

ye abstain from covetousness,61 and that ye be chaste and truthful. “Abstain from every
form of evil.”62 For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin
them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness,63 he shall be defiled by
idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the judgment
of the Lord? “Do we not know that the saints shall judge the world?”64 as Paul teaches. But
I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed
Paul laboured, and who are commended65 in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of
you in all those Churches which alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet
known Him. I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to
whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be ye then moderate in regard to this

<head>Introductory Note to the Epistle Concerning the Martyrdom of
Polycarp</head>
<p>Internal evidence goes far to establish the credit which Eusebius lends to this specimen
of the martyrologies, certainly not the earliest if we accept that of Ignatius as genuine. As
an encyclical of one of “the seven churches” to another of the same Seven, and as bearing
witness to their aggregation with others into the unity of “the Holy and Catholic Church,”
it is a very interesting witness, not only to an article of the creed, but to the original meaning
and acceptation of the same. More than this, it is evidence of the strength of Christ perfected
in human weakness; and thus it affords us an assurance of grace equal to our day in every
time of need. When I see in it, however, an example of what a noble army of martyrs, women
and children included, suffered in those days “for the testimony of Jesus,” and in order to
hand down the knowledge of the Gospel to these boastful ages of our own, I confess myself
edified by what I read, chiefly because I am humbled and abashed in comparing what a
Christian used to be, with what a Christian is, in our times, even at his best estate.</p>
<p>That this Epistle has been interpolated can hardly be doubted, when we compare it with
the unvarnished specimen, in Eusebius. As for the “fragrant smell” that came from the fire,
many kinds of wood emit the like in burning; and, apart from Oriental warmth of colouring,
there seems nothing incredible in the narrative if we except “the dove” (chap. xvi.), which,
however, is probably a corrupt reading,83 as suggested by our translators. The blade was
thrust into the martyr’s left side; and this, opening the heart, caused the outpouring of a
flood, and not a mere trickling. But, though Greek thus amended is a plausible conjecture,
there seems to have been nothing of the kind in the copy quoted by Eusebius. On the other
hand, note the truly catholic and scriptural testimony: “We love the martyrs, but the Son
of God we worship: it is impossible for us to worship any other.”
Bishop Jacobson assigns more than fifty pages to this martyrology, with a Latin version
and abundant notes. To these I must refer the student, who may wish to see this attractive
history in all the light of critical scholarship and, often, of admirable comment.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The following letter purports to have been written by the Church at Smyrna to the

it to a much later date than the middle of the second century, to which it has been commonly
ascribed. We cannot tell how much it may owe to the writers (chap. xxii.) who successively
transcribed it. Great part of it has been engrossed by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History
(iv. 15); and it is instructive to observe, that some of the most startling miraculous phenomena
recorded in the text as it now stands, have no place in the narrative as given by that early
historian of the Church. Much discussion has arisen respecting several particulars contained
in this Martyrium; but into these disputes we do not enter, having it for our aim simply to

<head>Chapter I.—Subject of which we write.</head>
<p>We have written to you, brethren, as to what relates to the martyrs, and especially to
the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the persecution, having, as it were, set a seal upon
it by his martyrdom. For almost all the events that happened previously [to this one], took
place that the Lord might show us from above a martyrdom becoming the Gospel. For he
waited to be delivered up, even as the Lord had done, that we also might become his followers,
while we look not merely at what concerns ourselves but have regard also to our neighbours.
For it is the part of a true and well-founded love, not only to wish one’s self to be saved, but
also all the brethren.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The wonderful constancy of the martyrs.</head>
<p>All the martyrdoms, then, were blessed and noble which took place according to the
will of God. For it becomes us who profess86 greater piety than others, to ascribe the authority
over all things to God. And truly,87 who can fail to admire their nobleness of mind, and
their patience, with that love towards their Lord which they displayed?—who, when they
were so torn with scourges, that the frame of their bodies, even to the very inward veins and
arteries, was laid open, still patiently endured, while even those that stood by pitied and
bewailed them. But they reached such a pitch of magnanimity, that not one of them let a
sigh or a groan escape them; thus proving to us all that those holy martyrs of Christ, at the
very time when they suffered such torments, were absent from the body, or rather, that the
Lord then stood by them, and communed with them. And, looking to the grace of Christ,
they despised all the torments of this world, redeeming themselves from eternal punishment
by [the suffering of] a single hour. For this reason the fire of their savage executioners appeared
cool to them. For they kept before their view escape from that fire which is eternal
and never shall be quenched, and looked forward with the eyes of their heart to those good
things which are laid up for such as endure; things “which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen,
neither have entered into the heart of man,”88 but were revealed by the Lord to them, inasmuch
as they were no longer men, but had already become angels. And, in like manner,
those who were condemned to the wild beasts endured dreadful tortures, being stretched
out upon beds full of spikes, and subjected to various other kinds of torments, in order that,
if it were possible, the tyrant might, by their lingering tortures, lead them to a denial [of
Christ].</p>

<p>For the devil did indeed invent many things against them; but thanks be to God, he
could not prevail over all. For the most noble Germanicus strengthened the timidity of
others by his own patience, and fought heroically89 with the wild beasts. For, when the
proconsul sought to persuade him, and urged him90 to take pity upon his age, he attracted
the wild beast towards himself, and provoked it, being desirous to escape all the more quickly
from an unrighteous and impious world. But upon this the whole multitude, marvelling at
the nobility of mind displayed by the devout and godly race of Christians,91 cried out, “Away
with the Atheists; let Polycarp be sought out!”</p>

to come forward voluntarily [for trial]. Him the proconsul, after many entreaties, persuaded
to swear and to offer sacrifice. Wherefore, brethren, we do not commend those who give
themselves up [to suffering], seeing the Gospel does not teach so to do.92</p>

<p>But the most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard [that he was sought for], was in
no measure disturbed, but resolved to continue in the city. However, in deference to the
wish of many, he was persuaded to leave it. He departed, therefore, to a country house not
far distant from the city. There he stayed with a few [friends], engaged in nothing else night
and day than praying for all men, and for the Churches throughout the world, according
to his usual custom. And while he was praying, a vision presented itself to him three days
before he was taken; and, behold, the pillow under his head seemed to him on fire. Upon
this, turning to those that were with him, he said to them prophetically, “I must be burnt
alive.”</p>

whither his pursuers immediately came after him. And when they found him not, they seized
upon two youths [that were there], one of whom, being subjected to torture, confessed. It
was thus impossible that he should continue hid, since those that betrayed him were of his
own household. The Irenarch93 then (whose office is the same as that of the Cleronomus94),
by name Herod, hastened to bring him into the stadium. [This all happened] that he might
fulfil his special lot, being made a partaker of Christ, and that they who betrayed him might
undergo the punishment of Judas himself.</p>

him lying down in the upper room of97 a certain little house, from which he might have
escaped into another place; but he refused, saying, “The will of God98 be done.”99 So when
he heard that they were come, he went down and spake with them. And as those that were
present marvelled at his age and constancy, some of them said. “Was so much effort100
made to capture such a venerable man?”101 Immediately then, in that very hour, he ordered
that something to eat and drink should be set before them, as much indeed as they cared
for, while he besought them to allow him an hour to pray without disturbance. And on their
giving him leave, he stood and prayed, being full of the grace of God, so that he could not
cease102 for two full hours, to the astonishment of them that heard him, insomuch that
many began to repent that they had come forth against so godly and venerable an old man.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as he had ceased praying, having made mention of all that had at any time
come in contact with him, both small and great, illustrious and obscure, as well as the whole
Catholic Church throughout the world, the time of his departure having arrived, they set
him upon an ass, and conducted him into the city, the day being that of the great Sabbath.
And the Irenarch Herod, accompanied by his father Nicetes (both riding in a chariot103),
met him, and taking him up into the chariot, they seated themselves beside him, and endeavoured
to persuade him, saying, “What harm is there in saying, Lord Cæsar,104 and in sacrificing,
with the other ceremonies observed on such occasions, and so make sure of safety?”
But he at first gave them no answer; and when they continued to urge him, he said, “I shall
not do as you advise me.” So they, having no hope of persuading him, began to speak bitter105
words unto him, and cast him with violence out of the chariot,106 insomuch that, in getting
down from the carriage, he dislocated his leg107 [by the fall]. But without being disturbed,108
and as if suffering nothing, he went eagerly forward with all haste, and was conducted to
the stadium, where the tumult was so great, that there was no possibility of being heard.</p>

<p>Now, as Polycarp was entering into the stadium, there came to him a voice from heaven,
saying, “Be strong, and show thyself a man, O Polycarp!” No one saw who it was that spoke
to him; but those of our brethren who were present heard the voice. And as he was brought
forward, the tumult became great when they heard that Polycarp was taken. And when he
came near, the proconsul asked him whether he was Polycarp. On his confessing that he
was, [the proconsul] sought to persuade him to deny [Christ], saying, “Have respect to thy
old age,” and other similar things, according to their custom, [such as], “Swear by the fortune
of Cæsar; repent, and say, Away with the Atheists.” But Polycarp, gazing with a stern
countenance on all the multitude of the wicked heathen then in the stadium, and waving
his hand towards them, while with groans he looked up to heaven, said, “Away with the
Atheists.”109 Then, the proconsul urging him, and saying, “Swear, and I will set thee at
liberty, reproach Christ;” Polycarp declared, “Eighty and six years have I served Him, and
He never did me any injury: how then can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour?”</p>

the fortune of Cæsar, and pretendest not to know who and what I am, hear me declare with
boldness, I am a Christian. And if you wish to learn what the doctrines110 of Christianity
are, appoint me a day, and thou shalt hear them.” The proconsul replied, “Persuade the
people.” But Polycarp said, “To thee I have thought it right to offer an account [of my faith];
for we are taught to give all due honour (which entails no injury upon ourselves) to the
powers and authorities which are ordained of God.111 But as for these, I do not deem them

of what is good in order to adopt that which is evil;113 and it is well for me to be changed
from what is evil to what is righteous.”114 But again the proconsul said to him, “I will cause
thee to be consumed by fire, seeing thou despisest the wild beasts, if thou wilt not repent.”
But Polycarp said, “Thou threatenest me with fire which burneth for an hour, and after a
little is extinguished, but art ignorant of the fire of the coming judgment and of eternal
punishment, reserved for the ungodly. But why tarriest thou? Bring forth what thou wilt.”</p>

<p>While he spoke these and many other like things, he was filled with confidence and joy,
and his countenance was full of grace, so that not merely did it not fall as if troubled by the
things said to him, but, on the contrary, the proconsul was astonished, and sent his herald
to proclaim in the midst of the stadium thrice, “Polycarp has confessed that he is a Christian.”
This proclamation having been made by the herald, the whole multitude both of the heathen
and Jews, who dwelt at Smyrna, cried out with uncontrollable fury, and in a loud voice,
“This is the teacher of Asia,115 the father of the Christians, and the overthrower of our gods,
he who has been teaching many not to sacrifice, or to worship the gods.” Speaking thus,
they cried out, and besought Philip the Asiarch116 to let loose a lion upon Polycarp. But
Philip answered that it was not lawful for him to do so, seeing the shows117 of wild beasts
were already finished. Then it seemed good to them to cry out with one consent, that Polycarp
should be burnt alive. For thus it behooved the vision which was revealed to him in regard
to his pillow to be fulfilled, when, seeing it on fire as he was praying, he turned about and
said prophetically to the faithful that were with him, “I must be burnt alive.”</p>

Polycarp, laying aside all his garments, and loosing his girdle, sought also to take off his
sandals,—a thing he was not accustomed to do, inasmuch as every one of the faithful was
always eager who should first touch his skin. For, on account of his holy life,118 he was, even
before his martyrdom, adorned119 with every kind of good. Immediately then they surrounded
him with those substances which had been prepared for the funeral pile. But when they
were about also to fix him with nails, he said, “Leave me as I am; for He that giveth me

“lest,” said he, “forsaking Him that was crucified, they begin to worship this one.” This he

<head>Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius</head>
<p>[a.d. 30–107.] The seductive myth which represents this Father as the little child whom
the Lord placed in the midst of his apostles (St. Matt. xviii. 2) indicates at least the period
when he may be supposed to have been born. That he and Polycarp were fellow-disciples
under St. John, is a tradition by no means inconsistent with anything in the Epistles of either.
His subsequent history is sufficiently indicated in the Epistles which follow.</p>
<p>Had not the plan of this series been so exclusively that of a mere revised reprint, the
writings of Ignatius themselves would have made me diffident as to the undertaking. It
seems impossible for any one to write upon the subject of these precious remains, without
provoking controversy. This publication is designed as an Eirenicon, and hence “few words
are best,” from one who might be supposed incapable of an unbiased opinion on most of
the points which have been raised in connection with these Epistles. I must content myself
therefore, by referring the studious reader to the originals as edited by Bishop Jacobson,
with a Latin version and copious annotations. That revered and learned divine honoured
me with his friendship; and his precious edition has been my frequent study, with theological
students, almost ever since it appeared in 1840. It is by no means superannuated by the
vigorous Ignatian literature which has since sprung up, and to which reference will he made
elsewhere. But I am content to leave the whole matter, without comment, to the minds of
Christians of whatever school and to their independent conclusions. It is a great thing to
present them in a single volume with the shorter and longer Epistles duly compared, and
with the Curetonian version besides. One luxury only I may claim, to relieve the drudging
task-work of a mere reviser. Surely I may point out some of the proverbial wisdom of this
great disciple, which has often stirred my soul, as with the trumpet heard by St. John in
Patmos. In him, indeed, the lions encountered a lion, one truly begotten of “the Lion of the
tribe of Judah.” Take, then, as a specimen, these thrilling injunctions from his letter to
Polycarp, to whom he bequeathed his own spirit, and in whom he well knew the Church
would recognize a sort of survival of St. John himself. If the reader has any true perception
of the rhythm and force of the Greek language, let him learn by heart the originals of the
following aphorisms:—</p>
<p>1 Find time to pray without ceasing.</p>
<p>2 Every wound is not healed with the same remedy.</p>
<p>3 The times demand thee, as pilots the haven.</p>
<p>4 The crown is immortality.1</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Does not this seem a pointed allusion to Rev. ii. 10?</note>

<pb n="133"/>
<p>5 Stand like a beaten anvil.2</p>
<p>6 It is the part of a good athlete to be bruised and to prevail.</p>
<p>7 Consider the times: look for Him who is above time.</p>
<p>8 Slight not the menservants and the handmaids.</p>
<p>9 Let your stewardship define your work.</p>
<p>10 A Christian is not his own master, but waits upon God.</p>
<p>Ignatius so delighted in his name Theophorus (sufficiently expounded in his own words
to Trajan or his official representative), that it is worth noting how deeply the early Christians
felt and believed in (2 Cor. vi. 16) the indwelling Spirit.</p>
<p>Ignatius has been censured for his language to the Romans, in which he seems to crave
martyrdom. But he was already condemned, in law a dead man, and felt himself at liberty
to glory in his tribulations. Is it more than modern Christians often too lightly sing? —
<lg>
<l>“Let cares like a wild deluge come,</l>
<l>And storms of sorrow fall,” etc.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>So the holy martyr adds, “Only let me attain unto Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Romans is utterly inconsistent with any conception on his part, that
Rome was the see and residence of a bishop holding any other than fraternal relations with
himself. It is very noteworthy that it is devoid of expressions, elsewhere made emphatic,3
which would have been much insisted upon had they been found herein. Think what use
would have been made of it, had the words which he addresses to the Smyrnæans (chap.
viii.) to strengthen their fidelity to Polycarp, been found in this letter to the Romans, especially
as in this letter we first find the use of the phrase “Catholic Church” in patristic writings.
He defines it as to be found “where Jesus Christ is,” words which certainly do not limit it to
communion with a professed successor of St. Peter.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The epistles ascribed to Ignatius have given rise to more controversy than any other
documents connected with the primitive Church. As is evident to every reader on the very
first glance at these writings, they contain numerous statements which bear on points of
ecclesiastical order that have long divided the Christian world; and a strong temptation has
<note type="footnote">2 Στῆθι ὡς ἄκμων τυπτόμενος.</note>
<note type="footnote">3 See To the Tralliaus, cap. 13. Much might have been made, had it been found here, out of the reference to
Christ the High Priest (Philadelphians, cap. 9).</note>

<pb n="134"/>
thus been felt to allow some amount of prepossession to enter into the discussion of their
authenticity or spuriousness. At the same time, this question has furnished a noble field for
the display of learning and acuteness, and has, in the various forms under which it has been
debated, given rise to not a few works of the very highest ability and scholarship. We shall
present such an outline of the controversy as may enable the reader to understand its position
at the present day.</p>
<p>There are, in all, fifteen Epistles which bear the name of Ignatius. These are the following:
One to the Virgin Mary, two to the Apostle John, one to Mary of Cassobelæ, one to the
Tarsians, one to the Antiochians, one to Hero, a deacon of Antioch, one to the Philippians;
one to the Ephesians, one to the Magnesians, one to the Trallians, one to the Romans, one
to the Philadelphians, one to the Smyrnæans, and one to Polycarp. The first three exist only
in Latin: all the rest are extant also in Greek.</p>
<p>It is now the universal opinion of critics, that the first eight of these professedly Ignatian
letters are spurious. They bear in themselves indubitable proofs of being the production of
a later age than that in which Ignatius lived. Neither Eusebius nor Jerome makes the least
reference to them; and they are now by common consent set aside as forgeries, which were
at various dates, and to serve special purposes, put forth under the name of the celebrated
Bishop of Antioch.</p>
<p>But after the question has been thus simplified, it still remains sufficiently complex. Of
the seven Epistles which are acknowledged by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 36), we possess two
Greek recensions, a shorter and a longer. It is plain that one or other of these exhibits a
corrupt text, and scholars have for the most part agreed to accept the shorter form as representing
the genuine letters of Ignatius. This was the opinion generally acquiesced in, from
the time when critical editions of these Epistles began to be issued, down to our own day.
Criticism, indeed, fluctuated a good deal as to which Epistles should be accepted and which
rejected. Archp. Usher (1644), Isaac Vossius (1646), J. B. Cotelerius (1672), Dr. T. Smith
(I709), and others, edited the writings ascribed to Ignatius in forms differing very considerably
as to the order in which they were arranged, and the degree of authority assigned them,
until at length, from about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the seven Greek Epistles,
of which a translation is here given, came to be generally accepted in their shorter form as
the genuine writings of Ignatius.</p>
<p>Before this date, however, there had not been wanting some who refused to acknowledge
the authenticity of these Epistles in either of the recensions in which they were then known
to exist. By far the most learned and elaborate work maintaining this position was that of
Daillé (or Dallæus), published in 1666. This drew forth in reply the celebrated Vindiciæ of
Bishop Pearson, which appeared in 1672. It was generally supposed that this latter work
had established on an immoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter form of the
Ignatian Epistles; and, as we have stated above, this was the conclusion almost universally

<pb n="135"/>
accepted down to our own day. The only considerable exception to this concurrence was
presented by Whiston, who laboured to maintain in his Primitive Christianity Revived (1711)
the superior claims of the longer recension of the Epistles, apparently influenced in doing
so by the support which he thought they furnished to the kind of Arianism which he had
adopted.</p>
<p>But although the shorter form of the Ignatian letters had been generally accepted in
preference to the longer, there was still a pretty prevalent opinion among scholars, that even
it could not be regarded as absolutely free from interpolations, or as of undoubted authenticity.
Thus said Lardner, in his Credibility of the Gospel History (1743): “have carefully
compared the two editions, and am very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger
are an interpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or abridgment of the
larger. … But whether the smaller themselves are the genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop
of Antioch, is a question that has been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the
ablest critics. And whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own
I have found it a very difficult question.”</p>
<p>This expression of uncertainty was repeated in substance by Jortin (1751), Mosheim
(1755), Griesbach (1768), Rosenmüller (1795), Neander (1826), and many others; some
going so far as to deny that we have any authentic remains of Ignatius at all, while others,
though admitting the seven shorter letters as being probably his, yet strongly suspected that
they were not free from interpolation. Upon the whole, however, the shorter recension was,
until recently, accepted without much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the work
of Bishop Pearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the Epistles of Ignatius.</p>
<p>But a totally different aspect was given to the question by the discovery of a Syriac version
of three of these Epistles among the mss. procured from the monastery of St. Mary Deipara,
in the desert of Nitria, in Egypt. In the years 1838, 1839, and again in 1842, Archdeacon
Tattam visited that monastery, and succeeded in obtaining for the English Government a
vast number of ancient Syriac manuscripts. On these being deposited in the British Museum,
the late Dr. Cureton, who then had charge of the Syriac department, discovered among
them, first, the Epistle to Polycarp, and then again, the same Epistle, with those to the Ephesians
and to the Romans, in two other volumes of manuscripts.</p>
<p>As the result of this discovery, Cureton published in 1845 a work, entitled, The Ancient
Syriac Version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesian, and the Romans, etc.,
in which he argued that these Epistles represented more accurately than any formerly published
what Ignatius had actually written. This, of course, opened up the controversy afresh.
While some accepted the views of Cureton, others very strenuously opposed them. Among
the former was the late Chev. Bunsen; among the latter, an anonymous writer in the English
Review, and Dr. Hefele, in his third edition of the Apostolic Fathers. In reply to those who
had controverted his arguments, Cureton published his Vindiciæ Ignatianæ in 1846, and

<pb n="136"/>
his Corpus Ignatianum in 1849. He begins his introduction to the last-named work with the
following sentences: “Exactly three centuries and a half intervened between the time when
three Epistles in Latin, attributed to St. Ignatius, first issued from the press, and the publication
in 1845 of three letters in Syriac bearing the name of the same apostolic writer. Very
few years passed before the former were almost universally regarded as false and spurious;
and it seems not improbable that scarcely a longer period will elapse before the latter be almost
as generally acknowledged and received as the only true and genuine letters of the
venerable Bishop of Antioch that have either come down to our times, or were ever known
in the earliest ages of the Christian Church.”</p>
<p>Had the somewhat sanguine hope thus expressed been realized, it would have been
unnecessary for us to present to the English reader more than a translation of these three
Syriac Epistles. But the Ignatian controversy is not yet settled. There are still those who hold
that the balance of argument is in favour of the shorter Greek, as against these Syriac Epistles.
They regard the latter as an epitome of the former, and think the harshness which, according
to them, exists in the sequence of thoughts and sentences, clearly shows that this is the case.
We have therefore given all the forms of the Ignatian letters which have the least claim on
our attention.4 The reader may judge, by comparison for himself, which of these is to be
accepted as genuine, supposing him disposed to admit the claims of any one of them. We
content ourselves with laying the materials for judgment before him, and with referring to
the above-named works in which we find the whole subject discussed. As to the personal
history of Ignatius, almost nothing is known. The principal source of information regarding
him is found in the account of his martyrdom, to which the reader is referred. Polycarp alludes
to him in his Epistle to the Philippians (chap. ix.), and also to his letters (chap. xiii.).
Irenæus quotes a passage from his Epistle to the Romans (Adv. Hær., v. 28; Epist. ad Rom.,
chap. iv.), without, however, naming him. Origen twice refers to him, first in the preface to
his Comm. on the Song of Solomon, where he quotes a passage from the Epistle of Ignatius
to the Romans, and again in his sixth homily on St. Luke, where he quotes from the Epistle
to the Ephesians, both times naming the author. It is unnecessary to give later references.</p>
<p>Supposing the letters of Ignatius and the account of his martyrdom to be authentic, we
learn from them that he voluntarily presented himself before Trajan at Antioch, the seat of
his bishopric, when that prince was on his first expedition against the Parthians and Armenians
(a.d. 107); and on professing himself a Christian, was condemned to the wild beasts.
After a long and dangerous voyage he came to Smyrna, of which Polycarp was bishop, and
thence wrote his four Epistles to the Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, and the Romans.
From Smyrna he came to Troas, and tarrying there a few days, he wrote to the Phil-

adelphians, the Smyrnæans, and Polycarp. He then came on to Neapolis, and passed through
the whole of Macedonia. Finding a ship at Dyrrachium in Epirus about to sail into Italy, he
embarked, and crossing the Adriatic, was brought to Rome, where he perished on the 20th
of December 107, or, as some think, who deny a twofold expedition of Trajan against the
Parthians, on the same day of the year a.d. 116.</p>

not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses38
such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore,
that does not assemble with the Church, has even39 by this manifested his pride, and condemned
himself. For it is written, “God resisteth the proud.”40 Let us be careful, then, not

if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of
one or two possesses42 such power that Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more
will the prayer of the bishop and of the whole Church, ascending up in harmony to God,
prevail for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He, therefore, that separates himself
from such, and does not meet in the society where sacrifices43 are offered, and with “the
Church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven,” is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,44
while he presents a mild outward appearance. Do ye, beloved, be careful to be subject to the
bishop, and the presbyters and the deacons. For he that is subject to these is obedient to
Christ, who has appointed them; but he that is disobedient to these is disobedient to Christ
Jesus. And “he that obeyeth not45 the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth
on him.” For he that yields not obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome,
and proud. But “God,” says [the Scripture] “resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble;”46 and, “The proud have greatly transgressed.” The Lord also says to the priests,
“He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that sent Me.

<p>Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,47 the more ought he to revere
him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His
household,48 as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should
look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus

and that no sect49 has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any

For “it behoves the man who looks carefully about him, and is active in his business, to stand
before kings, and not to stand before slothful men.”51 And indeed Onesimus himself greatly
commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect

Christ, the true Shepherd and Teacher. And ye are, as Paul wrote to you, “one body and one
spirit, because ye have also been called in one hope of the faith.52 Since also “there is one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all,

<p>For some are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile,
while yet they practise things unworthy of God, whom ye must flee as ye would wild beasts.
For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom ye must be on your guard,
inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. There is one Physician who is possessed
both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death;
both of Mary and of God; first possible and then impossible,—54 even Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus
Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, and hold opinions
contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to their own destruction, and that of those who give
credit to them, whom you must avoid as ye would wild beasts. For “the righteous man who
avoids them is saved for ever; but the destruction of the ungodly is sudden, and a subject of
rejoicing.”55 For “they are dumb dogs, that cannot bark,”56 raving mad, and biting secretly,
against whom ye must be on your guard, since they labour under an incurable disease. But
our Physician is the only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the
Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our
God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began,57 but who afterwards
became also man, of Mary the virgin. For “the Word was made flesh.”58 Being incorporeal,
He was in the body; being impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal,
He was in a mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free
our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health,
when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you, having false
doctrine, whom ye did not suffer to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that ye might
not receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones62 of the temple of the
Father, prepared for the building of God the Father, and drawn up on high by the instrument
of Jesus Christ, which is the cross,63 making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith
was the means by which you ascended, and your love the way which led up to God. Ye,
therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christbearers,
bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ,
in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse
and rejoice with you, because with respect to your Christian life64 ye love nothing but God
only.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you, holding the wicked
doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom ye did not allow entrance to sow their tares,
but stopped your ears that ye might not receive that error which was proclaimed by them,
as being persuaded that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of
Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not speak His own things,
but those of Christ, and that not from himself, but from the Lord; even as the Lord also announced
to us the things that He received from the Father. For, says He, “the word which
ye hear is not Mine, but the Father’s, who sent Me.”65 And says He of the Holy Spirit, “He
shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever things He shall hear from Me.”66 And He says
of Himself to the Father, “I have,” says He, “glorified Thee upon the earth; I have finished
the work which, Thou gavest Me; I have manifested Thy name to men.”67 And of the Holy
Ghost, “He shall glorify Me, for He receives of Mine.”68 But the spirit of deceit preaches
himself, and speaks his own things, for he seeks to please himself. He glorifies himself, for
he is full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent, soothing, flattering, treacherous, rhapsodical,
trifling, inharmonious, verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his power Jesus Christ will
deliver you, who has founded you upon the rock, as being chosen stones, well fitted for the
divine edifice of the Father, and who are raised up on high by Christ, who was crucified for
you, making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by

ye shall be as my mouth.”78 Be ye humble in response to their wrath; oppose to their blasphemies
your earnest prayers; while they go astray, stand ye stedfast in the faith. Conquer
ye their harsh temper by gentleness, their passion by meekness. For “blessed are the meek;”79
and Moses was meek above all men;80 and David was exceeding meek.81 Wherefore Paul
exhorts as follows: “The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle towards all men,

is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was
done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of the Father. He who
possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect,
and may both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is
hid from God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those
who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,110 and He may be in us as our

shall be great in the kingdom.”113 Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living

might breathe immortality into His Church. Be not ye anointed with the bad odour of the
doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which
is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of
God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the gift which the
Lord has of a truth sent to us?</p>
<p>For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured upon His head,123 that His
Church might breathe forth immortality. For saith [the Scripture], “Thy name is as ointment
poured forth; therefore have the virgins loved Thee; they have drawn Thee; at the odour of
Thine ointments we will run after Thee.”124 Let no one be anointed with the bad odour of
the doctrine of [the prince of] this world; let not the holy Church of God be led captive by
his subtlety, as was the first woman.125 Why do we not, as gifted with reason, act wisely?
When we had received from Christ, and had grafted in us the faculty of judging concerning
God, why do we fall headlong into ignorance? and why, through a careless neglect of acknowledging
the gift which we have received, do we foolishly perish?</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The glory of the cross.</head>
<p>Let my spirit be counted as nothing126 for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-
block127 to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal. “Where is the wise
man? where the disputer?”128 Where is the boasting of those who are styled prudent? For
our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment129 of God, conceived in the womb
by Mary, of the seed of David, but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by
His passion He might purify the water.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ is indeed a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to the
believing it is salvation and life eternal. “Where is the wise man? where the disputer?”130
Where is the boasting of those who are called mighty? For the Son of God, who was begotten
before time began,131 and established all things according to the will of the Father, He was
conceived in the womb of Mary, according to the appointment of God, of the seed of David,
and by the Holy Ghost. For says [the Scripture], “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and He shall be called Immanuel.”132 He was born and was baptized
by John, that He might ratify the institution committed to that prophet.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Three celebrated mysteries.</head>
<p>Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also her
offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of renown,133 which were wrought in
silence by134 God. How, then, was He manifested to the world?135 A star shone forth in
heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible, while its novelty struck
men with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a
chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation
felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else [in the heavens].
Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance
was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human
form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared
by God. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition
of death.</p>

the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star. It far exceeded
them all in brightness, and agitation was felt as to whence this new spectacle [proceeded].
Hence worldly wisdom became folly; conjuration was seen to be mere trifling; and magic
became utterly ridiculous. Every law137 of wickedness vanished away; the darkness of ignorance
was dispersed; and tyrannical authority was destroyed, God being manifested as a man,
and man displaying power as God. But neither was the former a mere imagination,138 nor
did the second imply a bare humanity;139 but the one was absolutely true,140 and the other
an economical arrangement.141 Now that received a beginning which was perfected by

<head>Chapter III.—Honour your youthful bishop.</head>
<p>Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his
youth,163 but to yield him all reverence, having respect to164 the power of God the Father,
as I have known even holy presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful
appearance165 [of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him,
or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore
fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your bishop], in honour of Him
who has willed us [so to do], since he that does not so deceives not [by such conduct] the
bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference
not to man,166 but to God, who knows all secrets.</p>
<p>Now it becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to yield him all reverence,
according to the will of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do,
not having regard to the manifest youth [of their bishop], but to his knowledge in God;
inasmuch as “not the ancient are [necessarily] wise, nor do the aged understand prudence;
but there is a spirit in men.”167 For Daniel the wise, at twelve years of age, became possessed
of the divine Spirit, and convicted the elders, who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being
false accusers, and of lusting after the beauty of another man’s wife.168 Samuel also, when
he was but a little child, reproved Eli, who was ninety years old, for giving honour to his
sons rather than to God.169 In like manner, Jeremiah also received this message from God,
“Say not, I am a child.”170 Solomon too, and Josiah, [exemplified the same thing.] The
former, being made king at twelve years of age, gave that terrible and difficult judgment in
the case of the two women concerning their children.171 The latter, coming to the throne
when eight years old172 cast down the altars and temples [of the idols], and burned down
the groves, for they were dedicated to demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests,
as the corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. Wherefore
youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be despised who is of a
wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked days.173 Timothy the Christ-bearer was

young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: “Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou
an example of the believers in word and in conduct.”174 It is becoming, therefore, that ye
also should be obedient to your bishop, and contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful
thing to contradict any such person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is
visible, but does [in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who, however, cannot be
mocked by any one. And every such act has respect not to man, but to God. For God says
to Samuel, “They have not mocked thee, but Me.”175 And Moses declares, “For their murmuring
is not against us, but against the Lord God.”176 No one of those has, [in fact,] remained
unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For Dathan and Abiram did not
speak against the law, but against Moses,177 and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah
also,178 and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed
by fire. Absalom, again,179 who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had
his evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan180 beheaded
for the same reason. Uzziah,181 when he presumed to oppose the priests and the
priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,182 because he did not wait
for Samuel the high priest. It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your superiors.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Death is the fate of all such.</head>
<p>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set before
us—death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of
coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its special character
stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]184 The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing
have, in love, the character of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in
readiness to die into His passion,185 His life is not in us.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life upon our observance
[of God’s precepts], but death as the result of disobedience, and every one, according to the
choice he makes, shall go to his own place, let us flee from death, and make choice of life.
For I remark, that two different characters are found among men—the one true coin, the
other spurious. The truly devout man is the right kind of coin, stamped by God Himself.
The ungodly man, again, is false coin, unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God,
but by the devil. I do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, but that
there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes to the devil. If any one
is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if he is irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made
such, not by nature, but by his own choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of
wickedness. The believing possess the image of their Prince, God the Father, and Jesus
Christ, through whom, if we are not in readiness to die for the truth into His passion,186
His life is not in us.</p>

Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being
come together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one
hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more
excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to
one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.</p>
<p>As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, “I can of mine own
self do nothing,”194 so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without
the bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his approval.195
For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the will of] God. Do ye all come together
into the same place for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope,
with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more excellent. Do ye all, as

proceeding forth from silence,196 and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</p>
<p>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, “nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies,”
197 and things in which the Jews make their boast. “Old things are passed away: behold,
all things have become new.”198 For if we still live according to the Jewish law, and the circumcision
of the flesh, we deny that we have received grace. For the divinest prophets lived
according to Jesus Christ. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by grace
to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested
Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but essential. For He is not
the voice of an articulate utterance, but a substance begotten by divine power, who has in
all things pleased Him that sent Him.199</p>

<p>If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things200 have come
to the possession of a new201 hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance202
of the Lord’s Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by
His death—whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith,203 and therefore
endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master—how shall we
be able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did
wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly waited for, being come,
raised them from the dead.204</p>
<p>If, then, those who were conversant with the ancient Scriptures came to newness of
hope, expecting the coming of Christ, as the Lord teaches us when He says, “If ye had believed
Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me;”205 and again, “Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; for before Abraham was, I am;”206 how
shall we be able to live without Him? The prophets were His servants, and foresaw Him by
the Spirit, and waited for Him as their Teacher, and expected Him as their Lord and Saviour,
saying, “He will come and save us.”207 Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the
Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness; for “he that does not work, let him not eat.”208
For say the [holy] oracles, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread.” 209 But let every
one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law,
not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things
prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space,
nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them.210 And after the
observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord’s Day as a festival, the
resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week]. Looking forward to this,

<head>Chapter X.—Beware of Judaizing.</head>
<p>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according
to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to
live according to the principles of Christianity.215 For whosoever is called by any other name
besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye
changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among
you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess216
Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace217 Judaism, but Judaism
Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth might be gathered together to God.</p>
<p>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according
to our works, we should cease to be. For “if Thou, Lord, shalt mark iniquities, O Lord, who
shall stand?”218 Let us therefore prove ourselves worthy of that name which we have received.
For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, he is not of God; for he has not received
the prophecy which speaks thus concerning us: “The people shall be called by a new
name, which the Lord shall name them, and shall be a holy people.”219 This was first fulfilled
in Syria; for “the disciples were called Christians at Antioch,”220 when Paul and Peter were
laying the foundations of the Church. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the corrupt
leaven,221 and be ye changed into the new leaven of grace. Abide in Christ, that the
stranger222 may not have dominion over you. It is absurd to speak of Jesus Christ with the
tongue, and to cherish in the mind a Judaism which has now come to an end. For where
there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism. For Christ is one, in whom every nation that
believes, and every tongue that confesses, is gathered unto God. And those that were of a
stony heart have become the children of Abraham, the friend of God;223 and in his seed all
those have been blessed224 who were ordained to eternal life225 in Christ.</p>

God, His Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the
Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the king. He also died,

<p>For, since ye are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not after

in His death, ye may escape from death. It is therefore necessary that, as ye indeed do, so
without the bishop ye should do nothing, but should also be subject to the presbytery, as
to the apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall [at last] be found.
It is fitting also that the deacons, as being [the ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ,
should in every respect be pleasing to all.255 For they are not ministers of meat and drink,
but servants of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation
[against them], as they would do fire.</p>
<p>Be ye subject to the bishop as to the Lord, for “he watches for your souls, as one that

death, ye may by baptism be made partakers of His resurrection. It is therefore necessary,
whatsoever things ye do, to do nothing without the bishop. And be ye subject also to the

highly instructive,260 and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly
must reverence, seeing they are261 also pleased that I do not spare myself. But shall I, when
permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a
condemned262 man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?</p>
<p>And do ye reverence them as Christ Jesus, of whose place they are the keepers, even as
the bishop is the representative of the Father of all things, and the presbyters are the sanhedrim

Church, no congregation of holy ones, no assembly of saints. I am persuaded that ye also
are of this opinion. For I have received the manifestation264 of your love, and still have it

<head>Chapter VI.—Abstain from the poison of heretics.</head>
<p>I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus Christ, entreat you that ye use Christian
nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those275
[that are given to this] mix276 up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things which
are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he
who is ignorant of does greedily277 take, with a fatal pleasure278 leading to his own death.</p>
<p>I therefore, yet not I, out the love of Jesus Christ, “entreat you that ye all speak the same
thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in
the same mind, and in the same judgment.”279 For there are some vain talkers280 and deceivers,
not Christians, but Christ-betrayers,281 bearing about the name of Christ in deceit,
and “corrupting the word”282 of the Gospel; while they intermix the poison of their deceit
with their persuasive talk,283 as if they mingled aconite with sweet wine, that so he who
drinks, being deceived in his taste by the very great sweetness of the draught, may incautiously
meet with his death. One of the ancients gives us this advice, “Let no man be called good
who mixes good with evil.”284 For they speak of Christ, not that they may preach Christ,
but that they may reject Christ; and they speak285 of the law, not that they may establish

Father, and the law from Christ. They also calumniate His being born of the Virgin; they
are ashamed of His cross; they deny His passion; and they do not believe His resurrection.
They introduce God as a Being unknown; they suppose Christ to be unbegotten; and as to
the Spirit, they do not admit that He exists. Some of them say that the Son is a mere man,
and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but the same person, and that the creation is
the work of God, not by Christ, but by some other strange power.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The same continued.</head>
<p>Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. And this will be the case with you if
you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union with286 Jesus Christ our God, and
the bishop, and the enactments of the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure, but287 he
that is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the bishop, and presbytery,
and deacons,288 such a man is not pure in his conscience.</p>
<p>Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons, that ye admit not of a snare for your
own souls. And act so that your life shall be without offence to all men, lest ye become as
“a snare upon a watch-tower, and as a net which is spread out.”289 For “he that does not
heal himself in his own works, is the brother of him that destroys himself.”290 If, therefore,
ye also put away conceit, arrogance, disdain, and haughtiness, it will be your privilege to be
inseparably united to God, for “He is nigh unto those that fear Him.”291 And says He, “Upon
whom will I look, but upon him that is humble and quiet, and that trembles at my words?”292
And do ye also reverence your bishop as Christ Himself, according as the blessed apostles
have enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure, wherefore also he is obedient to the
bishop and presbyters: but he that is without is one that does anything apart from the bishop,
the presbyters, and the deacons. Such a person is defiled in his conscience, and is worse than
an infidel. For what is the bishop but one who beyond all others possesses all power and
authority, so far as it is possible for a man to possess it, who according to his ability has been
made an imitator of the Christ of God?293 And what is the presbytery but a sacred assembly,
the counsellors and assessors of the bishop? And what are the deacons but imitators of the
angelic powers,294 fulfilling a pure and blameless ministry unto him, as the holy Stephen
did to the blessed James, Timothy and Linus to Paul, Anencletus and Clement to Peter? He,
therefore, that will not yield obedience to such, must needs be one utterly without God, an
impious man who despises Christ, and depreciates His appointments.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Be on your guard against the snares of the devil.</head>
<p>Not that I know there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you on your guard,
inasmuch as I love you greatly, and foresee the snares of the devil. Wherefore, clothing295
yourselves with meekness, be ye renewed296 in faith, that is the flesh of the Lord, and in
love, that is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let no one of you cherish any grudge against his
neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles, lest by means of a few foolish men the whole
multitude [of those that believe] in God be evil spoken of. For, “Woe to him by whose vanity
my name is blasphemed among any.”297</p>
<p>Now I write these things unto you, not that I know there are any such persons among
you; nay, indeed I hope that God will never permit any such report to reach my ears, He
“who spared not His Son for the sake of His holy Church.”298 But foreseeing the snares of
the wicked one, I arm you beforehand by my admonitions, as my beloved and faithful children
in Christ, furnishing you with the means of protection299 against the deadly disease
of unruly men, by which do ye flee from the disease300 [referred to] by the good-will of
Christ our Lord. Do ye therefore, clothing301 yourselves with meekness, become the imitators
of His sufferings, and of His love, wherewith302 He loved us when He gave Himself a
ransom303 for us, that He might cleanse us by His blood from our old ungodliness, and bestow
life on us when we were almost on the point of perishing through the depravity that
was in us. Let no one of you, therefore, cherish any grudge against his neighbour. For says
our Lord, “Forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you.”304 Give no occasion to the Gentiles,
lest “by means of a few foolish men the word and doctrine [of Christ] be blasphemed.”305

<head>Chapter IX.—Reference to the history of Christ.</head>
<p>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with307 Jesus Christ,
who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and
drink. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died,
in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised
from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will
so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the
true life.</p>
<p>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with308 Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly begotten
of God and of the Virgin, but not after the same manner. For indeed God and man are
not the same. He truly assumed a body; for “the Word was made flesh,”309 and lived upon
earth without sin. For says He, “Which of you convicteth me of sin?”310 He did in reality
both eat and drink. He was crucified and died under Pontius Pilate. He really, and not merely
in appearance, was crucified, and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and
under the earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are possessed of incorporeal natures; by
those on earth, the Jews and Romans, and such persons as were present at that time when
the Lord was crucified; and by those under the earth, the multitude that arose along with
the Lord. For says the Scripture, “Many bodies of the saints that slept arose,”311 their graves
being opened. He descended, indeed, into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a
multitude; and rent asunder that means312 of separation which had existed from the beginning
of the world, and cast down its partition-wall. He also rose again in three days, the
Father raising Him up; and after spending forty days with the apostles, He was received up
to the Father, and “sat down at His right hand, expecting till His enemies are placed under
His feet.”313 On the day of the preparation, then, at the third hour, He received the sentence
from Pilate, the Father permitting that to happen; at the sixth hour He was crucified; at the
ninth hour He gave up the ghost; and before sunset He was buried.314 During the Sabbath
He continued under the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of Arimathæa had laid Him. At
the dawning of the Lord’s day He arose from the dead, according to what was spoken by

<head>Chapter X.—The reality of Christ’s passion.</head>
<p>But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed
to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long
to be exposed to316 the wild beasts? Do I therefore die in vain?317 Am I not then guilty of
falsehood318 against [the cross of] the Lord?</p>
<p>But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, He became man in
appearance [only], that He did not in reality take unto Him a body, that He died in appearance
[merely], and did not in very deed suffer, then for what reason am I now in bonds, and
long to be exposed to319 the wild beasts? In such a case, I die in vain, and am guilty of
falsehood320 against the cross of the Lord. Then also does the prophet in vain declare, “They
shall look on Him whom they have pierced, and mourn over themselves as over one beloved.”
321 These men, therefore, are not less unbelievers than were those that crucified Him.
But as for me, I do not place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in reality.
For that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly conceive a body
which had God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin, having clothed
Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He who forms all men in the womb, was
Himself really in the womb, and made for Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but
without any intercourse of man. He was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual
period of time; and was really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished with milk,
and partook of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when He had lived among
men for thirty years, He was baptized by John, really and not in appearance; and when He
had preached the Gospel three years, and done signs and wonders, He who was Himself the
Judge was judged by the Jews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the governor; was scourged,
was smitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a purple robe; He
was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and not in appearance, not in imagination, not
in deceit. He really died, and was buried, and rose from the dead, even as He prayed in a
certain place, saying, “But do Thou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall recompense
them.”322 And the Father, who always hears Him,323 answered and said, “Arise, O God,

and judge the earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine inheritance.”324 The
Father, therefore, who raised Him up, will also raise us up through Him, apart from whom
no one will attain to true life. For says He, “I am the life; he that believeth in me, even though
he die, shall live: and every one that liveth and believeth in me, even though he die, shall
live for ever.”325 Do ye therefore flee from these ungodly heresies; for they are the inventions

<p>Flee, therefore, those evil offshoots [of Satan], which produce death-bearing fruit,

For if they were, they would appear as branches of the cross, and their fruit would be incorruptible.

therefore, cannot be born by itself, without its members; God, who is [the Saviour] Himself,

called,331 who are lovers of pleasure, and given to calumnious speeches. Avoid also the
children of the evil one, Theodotus and Cleobulus, who produce death-bearing fruit,
whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies, and that not a mere temporary death, but one
that shall endure for ever. These men are not the planting of the Father, but are an accursed
brood. And says the Lord, “Let every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted be
rooted up.”332 For if they had been branches of the Father, they would not have been “enemies
of the cross of Christ,”333 but rather of those who “killed the Lord of glory.”334 But
now, by denying the cross, and being ashamed of the passion, they cover the transgression
of the Jews, those fighters against God, those murderers of the Lord; for it were too little to

God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God,
namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Avoid schismatics.</head>
<p>Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they
are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding
purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And
as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these,
too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren.
If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom
of God. If any one walks according to a strange412 opinion, he agrees not with the passion
[of Christ.].</p>
<p>Keep yourselves, then, from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, but that
wild beast, the destroyer of men, because they are not the planting of the Father, but the
seed of the wicked one. Not that I have found any division among you do I write these things;
but I arm you beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of Christ are also with
the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and embrace communion with the accursed,
these shall be cut off along with them. For they are not Christ’s husbandry, but the seed of
the enemy, from whom may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd, that most
faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you. I therefore exhort you in the Lord to
receive with all tenderness those that repent and return to the unity of the Church, that
through your kindness and forbearance they may recover413 themselves out of the snare of
the devil, and becoming worthy of Jesus Christ, may obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom
of Christ. Brethren, be not deceived. If any man follows him that separates from the truth,
he shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand aloof from the
preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For it is obligatory neither to separate
from the godly, nor to associate with the ungodly. If any one walks according to a strange414
opinion, he is not of Christ, nor a partaker of His passion; but is a fox,415 a destroyer of the
vineyard of Christ. Have no fellowship416 with such a man, lest ye perish along with him,
even should he be thy father, thy son, thy brother, or a member of thy family. For says [the
Scripture], “Thine eye shall not spare him.”417 You ought therefore to “hate those that hate
God, and to waste away [with grief] on account of His enemies.”418 I do not mean that you
should beat them or persecute them, as do the Gentiles “that know not the Lord and God;”419

one baptism;424 and one Church which the holy apostles established from one end of the
earth to the other by the blood of Christ, and by their own sweat and toil; it behoves you
also, therefore, as “a peculiar people, and a holy nation,”425 to perform all things with harmony
in Christ. Wives, be ye subject to your husbands in the fear of God;426 and ye virgins,
to Christ in purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring that which is better,
not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake of meditating on the law. Children, obey
your parents, and have an affection for them, as workers together with God for your birth
[into the world]. Servants, be subject to your masters in God, that ye may be the freed-men
of Christ.427 Husbands, love your wives, as fellow-servants of God, as your own body, as
the partners of your life, and your co-adjutors in the procreation of children. Virgins, have
Christ alone before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being enlightened by the
Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun,
as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved
disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this life in

Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph, and Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul,
and the rest of the apostles, that were married men. For they entered into these marriages
not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of mankind. Fathers,
“bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;”430 and teach them the
holy Scriptures, and also trades, that they may not indulge in idleness. Now [the Scripture]
says, “A righteous father educates [his children] well; his heart shall rejoice in a wise son.”431
Masters, be gentle towards your servants, as holy Job has taught you;432 for there is one
nature, and one family of mankind. For “in Christ there is neither bond nor free.”433 Let
governors be obedient to Cæsar; soldiers to those that command them; deacons to the
presbyters, as to high-priests; the presbyters, and deacons, and the rest of the clergy, together
with all the people, and the soldiers, and the governors, and Cæsar [himself], to the bishop;
the bishop to Christ, even as Christ to the Father. And thus unity is preserved throughout.
Let not the widows be wanderers about, nor fond of dainties, nor gadders from house to
house; but let them be like Judith, noted for her seriousness; and like Anna, eminent for her
sobriety. I do not ordain these things as an apostle: for “who am I, or what is my father’s
house,”434 that I should pretend to be equal in honour to them? But as your “fellow-soldier,”

love the prophets as those who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit
with the apostles. For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to themselves] one
and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing438 spirit; so also did the prophets and the
apostles receive from God, through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good,
and sovereign,439 and true, and the Author of [saving] knowledge.440 For there is one God
of the Old and New Testament, “one Mediator between God and men,” for the creation of
both intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable
providence [over them]. There is also one Comforter, who displayed441 His power in Moses,
and the prophets, and apostles. All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in
Him, and waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being holy ones,
worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them by Jesus Christ, in the

<p>But if any one preach the Jewish law442 unto you, listen not to him. For it is better to
hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from
one uncircumcised. But if either of such persons do not speak concerning Jesus Christ, they
are in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon which are written
only the names of men. Flee therefore the wicked devices and snares of the prince of this

But be ye all joined together445 with an undivided heart. And I thank my God that I have a

but denies the God of the law and of the prophets, saying that the Father of Christ is not the
Maker of heaven and earth, he has not continued in the truth any more than his father the
devil,449 and is a disciple of Simon Magus, not of the Holy Spirit. If any one says there is
one God, and also confesses Christ Jesus, but thinks the Lord to be a mere man, and not the
only-begotten450 God, and Wisdom, and the Word of God, and deems Him to consist
merely of a soul and body, such an one is a serpent, that preaches deceit and error for the
destruction of men. And such a man is poor in understanding, even as by name he is an
Ebionite.451 If any one confesses the truths mentioned,452 but calls lawful wedlock, and the
procreation of children, destruction and pollution, or deems certain kinds of food abominable,

man who is falsely called a Nicolaitan, this person can neither be a lover of God, nor a lover
of Christ, but is a corrupter of his own flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and a
stranger to Christ. All such persons are but monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon
which are written only the names of dead men. Flee, therefore, the wicked devices and snares

<p>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to464 unity. For where there is
division and wrath, God doth not dwell. To all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness,
if they turn in penitence to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop.465 I trust
[as to you] in the grace of Jesus Christ, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort
you to do nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of Christ. When I heard some
saying, If I do not find it in the ancient466 Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my
saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be proved. But to me Jesus
Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the
faith467 which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through
your prayers, to be justified.</p>
<p>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity; adding this also, that
where there is diversity of judgment, and wrath, and hatred, God does not dwell. To all them
that repent, God grants forgiveness, if they with one consent return to the unity of Christ,
and communion with the bishop.468 I trust to the grace of Jesus Christ, that He will free
you from every bond of wickedness.469 I therefore exhort you that ye do nothing out of
strife,470 but according to the doctrine of Christ. For I have heard some saying, If I do not
find the Gospel in the archives, I will not believe it. To such persons I say that my archives
are Jesus Christ, to disobey whom is manifest destruction. My authentic archives are His
cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which bears on these things, by which I
desire, through your prayers, to be justified. He who disbelieves the Gospel disbelieves
everything along with it. For the archives ought not to be preferred to the Spirit.471 “It is

<head>Chapter IX.—The Old Testament is good: the New Testament is better.</head>
<p>The priests473 indeed are good, but the High Priest is better; to whom the holy of holies
has been committed, and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of God. He is the door
of the Father, by which enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the
apostles, and the Church. All these have for their object the attaining to the unity of God.
But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz., the
appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets
announced Him,474 but the Gospel is the perfection of immortality.475 All these things are
good together, if ye believe in love.</p>
<p>The priests476 indeed, and the ministers of the word, are good; but the High Priest is
better, to whom the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been entrusted
with the secrets of God. The ministering powers of God are good. The Comforter is holy,
and the Word is holy, the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and exercises a
providence over them all. This is the Way477 which leads to the Father, the Rock,478 the
Defence,479 the Key, the Shepherd,480 the Sacrifice, the Door481 of knowledge, through
which have entered Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and all the company of the
prophets, and these pillars of the world, the apostles, and the spouse of Christ, on whose
account He poured out His own blood, as her marriage portion, that He might redeem her.
All these things tend towards the unity of the one and only true God. But the Gospel possesses
something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz. the appearing of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, His passion, and the resurrection itself. For those things which the prophets
announced, saying, “Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation
of the Gentiles,”482 have been fulfilled in the Gospel, [our Lord saying,] “Go ye and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.”483 All then are good together, the law, the prophets, the apostles, the whole company
[of others] that have believed through them: only if we love one another.</p>

so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil
spirits.503</p>
<p>Now, He suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really, and not in appearance
only, even as also He truly rose again. But not, as some of the unbelievers, who are
ashamed of the formation of man, and the cross, and death itself, affirm, that in appearance
only, and not in truth, He took a body of the Virgin, and suffered only in appearance, forgetting,
as they do, Him who said, “The Word was made flesh;”504 and again, “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up;”505 and once more, “If I be lifted up from the
earth, I will draw all men unto Me.”506 The Word therefore did dwell in flesh, for “Wisdom
built herself an house.”507 The Word raised up again His own temple on the third day, when
it had been destroyed by the Jews fighting against Christ. The Word, when His flesh was
lifted up, after the manner of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, drew all men to Himself
for their eternal salvation.508</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Christ was possessed of a body after His resurrection.</head>
<p>For I know that after His resurrection also He was still possessed of flesh,509 and I believe
that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to
them, “Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.”510 And immediately
they touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His flesh and spirit. For this cause
also they despised death, and were found its conquerors.511 And after his resurrection He
did eat and drink with them, as being possessed of flesh, although spiritually He was united
to the Father.</p>
<p>And I know that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born and crucified,
but I also know that He was so after His resurrection, and believe that He is so now. When,
for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to them, “Lay hold, handle Me,
and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.”512 “For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see Me have.”513 And He says to Thomas, “Reach hither thy finger into the print of the nails,
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side;”514 and immediately they believed
that He was Christ. Wherefore Thomas also says to Him, “My Lord, and my God.”515 And
on this account also did they despise death, for it were too little to say, indignities and stripes.
Nor was this all; but also after He had shown Himself to them, that He had risen indeed,
and not in appearance only, He both ate and drank with them during forty entire days. And
thus was He, with the flesh, received up in their sight unto Him that sent Him, being with
that same flesh to come again, accompanied by glory and power. For, say the [holy] oracles,
“This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as
ye have seen Him go unto heaven.”516 But if they say that He will come at the end of the
world without a body, how shall those “see Him that pierced Him,”517 and when they recognise
Him, “mourn for themselves?”518 For incorporeal beings have neither form nor figure,
nor the aspect519 of an animal possessed of shape, because their nature is in itself simple.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Beware of these heretics.</head>
<p>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as
I do]. But I guard you beforehand from those beasts in the shape of men, whom you must
not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must pray to God
for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very
difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this. But if these
things were done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound.
And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts?
But, [in fact,] he who is near to the sword is near to God; he that is among the wild beasts
is in company with God; provided only he be so in the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all
these things that I may suffer together with Him,520 He who became a perfect man inwardly
strengthening me.521</p>

why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But,
[in fact,] I endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in reality, that I may
suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly strengthens me; for of myself I have
no such ability.</p>

<head>Chapter VI—Unbelievers in the blood of Christ shall be condemned.</head>
<p>Let no man deceive himself. Both the things which are in heaven, and the glorious angels,
527 and rulers, both visible and invisible, if they believe not in the blood of Christ, shall,
in consequence, incur condemnation.528 “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”529
Let not [high] place puff any one up: for that which is worth all is530 faith and love, to which
nothing is to be preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect
to the grace of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God.
They have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed; of the
bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.</p>
<p>Let no man deceive himself. Unless he believes that Christ Jesus has lived in the flesh,
and shall confess His cross and passion, and the blood which He shed for the salvation of
the world, he shall not obtain eternal life, whether he be a king, or a priest, or a ruler, or a
private person, a master or a servant, a man or a woman. “He that is able to receive it, let
him receive it.”531 Let no man’s place, or dignity, or riches, puff him up; and let no man’s
low condition or poverty abase him. For the chief points are faith towards God, hope towards
Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for which we look, and love towards God and
our neighbour. For, “Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour
as thyself.”532 And the Lord says, “This is life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom He has sent.”533 And again, “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye
love one another. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”534 Do
ye, therefore, notice those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of
Christ cannot be known, and how they exhibit enmity and deceit in their dealings with one
another. They have no regard for love; they despise the good things we expect hereafter;
they regard present things as if they were durable; they ridicule him that is in affliction; they
laugh at him that is in bonds.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Let us stand aloof from such heretics.</head>
<p>They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer,535 because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which
the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift
of God, incur death536 in the midst of their disputes. But it were better for them to treat it
with respect,537 that they also might rise again. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep
aloof from such persons, and not to speak of538 them either in private or in public, but to
give heed to the prophets, and above all, to the Gospel, in which the passion [of Christ] has
been revealed to us, and the resurrection has been fully proved.539 But avoid all divisions,
as the beginning of evils.</p>
<p>They are ashamed of the cross; they mock at the passion; they make a jest of the resurrection.
They are the offspring of that spirit who is the author of all evil, who led Adam,540
by means of his wife, to transgress the commandment, who slew Abel by the hands of Cain,
who fought against Job, who was the accuser of Joshua541 the son of Josedech, who sought
to “sift the faith”542 of the apostles, who stirred up the multitude of the Jews against the
Lord, who also now “worketh in the children of disobedience;543 from whom the Lord Jesus
Christ will deliver us, who prayed that the faith of the apostles might not fail,544 not because
He was not able of Himself to preserve it, but because He rejoiced in the pre-eminence of
the Father. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such persons, and neither
in private nor in public to talk with545 them; but to give heed to the law, and the prophets,
and to those who have preached to you the word of salvation. But flee from all abominable
heresies, and those that cause schisms, as the beginning of evils.</p>

<p>Moreover,551 it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of

to reverence552 both God and the bishop. He who honours the bishop has been honoured
by God; he who does anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve
the devil. Let all things, then, abound to you through grace, for ye are worthy. Ye have refreshed
me in all things, and Jesus Christ [shall refresh] you. Ye have loved me when absent
as well as when present. May God recompense you, for whose sake, while ye endure all
things, ye shall attain unto Him.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of conduct],
and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. For “in Hades there
is no one who can confess his sins.”553 For “behold the man, and his work is before him.”554
And [the Scripture saith], “My son, honour thou God and the king.”555 And say I, Honour
thou God indeed, as the Author and Lord of all things, but the bishop as the high-priest,
who bears the image of God—of God, inasmuch as he is a ruler, and of Christ, in his capacity
of a priest. After Him, we must also honour the king. For there is no one superior to God,
or even like to Him, among all the beings that exist. Nor is there any one in the Church
greater than the bishop, who ministers as a priest to God for the salvation of the whole
world. Nor, again, is there any one among rulers to be compared with the king, who secures
peace and good order to those over whom he rules. He who honours the bishop shall be
honoured by God, even as he that dishonours him shall be punished by God. For if he that
rises up against kings is justly held worthy of punishment, inasmuch as he dissolves public
order, of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,556 who
presumes to do anything without the bishop, thus both destroying the [Church’s] unity,
and throwing its order into confusion? For the priesthood is the very highest point of all
good things among men, against which whosoever is mad enough to strive, dishonours not
man, but God, and Christ Jesus, the First-born, and the only High Priest, by nature, of the
Father. Let all things therefore be done by you with good order in Christ. Let the laity be
subject to the deacons; the deacons to the presbyters; the presbyters to the bishop; the
bishop to Christ, even as He is to the Father. As ye, brethren, have refreshed me, so will Jesus

<head>Chapter I.—Commendation and exhortation.</head>
<p>Having obtained good proof that thy mind is fixed in God as upon an immoveable rock,
I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought worthy [to behold] thy blameless face,582
which may I ever enjoy in God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to
press forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be saved. Maintain thy position
with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing
is better. Bear with all, even as the Lord does with thee. Support583 all in love, as also thou
doest. Give thyself to prayer without ceasing.584 Implore additional understanding to what
thou already hast. Be watchful, possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately,
as God enables thee.585 Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect athlete [in the Christian
life]: where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.</p>

<p>If thou lovest the good disciples, no thanks are due to thee on that account; but rather
seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound is not healed with
the same plaster. Mitigate violent attacks [of disease] by gentle applications.591 Be in all

of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest deal tenderly593 with those [evils] that present
themselves visibly before thee. And as respects those that are not seen,594 pray that [God]
would reveal them unto thee, in order that thou mayest be wanting in nothing, but mayest
abound in every gift. The times call for thee, as pilots do for the winds, and as one tossed
with tempest seeks for the haven, so that both thou [and those under thy care] may attain
to God. Be sober as an athlete of God: the prize set before thee is immortality and eternal
life, of which thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for thine,595 and my
bonds also, which thou hast loved.</p>

<p>Let not those who seem worthy of credit, but teach strange doctrines,599 fill thee with

<head>Introductory Note to the Syriac Version of the Ignatian Epistles</head>
<p>When the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles was introduced to the English world
in 1845, by Mr. Cureton, the greatest satisfaction was expressed by many, who thought the
inveterate controversy about to be settled. Lord Russell made the learned divine a canon of
Westminster Abbey, and the critical Chevalier Bunsen649 committed himself as its patron.
To the credit of the learned, in general, the work was gratefully received, and studied with
scientific conscientiousness by Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period is valuable;
and the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at least, which are fragmentary and
abridged, and yet they are a valuable contribution to the study of the whole case.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>Some account of the discovery of the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles has been
already given. We have simply to add here a brief description of the mss. from which the
Syriac text has been printed. That which is named α by Cureton, contains only the Epistle
to Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we have followed. He fixes
its age somewhere in the first half of the sixth century, or before the year 550. The second
ms., which Cureton refers to as β, is assigned by him to the seventh or eighth century. It
contains the three Epistles of Ignatius, and furnishes the text here followed in the Epistles
to the Ephesians and Romans. The third ms., which Cureton quotes as γ, has no date, but,
as he tells us, “belonged to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in a.d. 931, and was
written apparently about three or four centuries earlier.” It contains the three Epistles to
Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text of all these mss. is in several passages
manifestly corrupt, and the translators appear at times to have mistaken the meaning of the
Greek original.</p>
<p>[N.B.—Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that the discovery of the lost work of Hippolytus
“throws new light on an obscure point of the Ignatian controversy,” i.e., the Sige in the
Epistle to the Magnesians (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter is unworthy of a candid
scholar.]</p>

has as his own bishop God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ: [wishes] abundance of
happiness.</p>
<note type="footnote">650 The inscription varies in each of the three Syriac mss., being in the first, “The Epistle of my lord Ignatius,

<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>Because thy mind is acceptable to me, inasmuch as it is established in God, as on a rock
which is immoveable, I glorify God the more exceedingly that I have been counted worthy
of [seeing] thy face, which I longed after in God. Now I beseech thee, by the grace with
which thou art clothed, to add [speed] to thy course, and that thou ever pray for all men
that they may be saved, and that thou demand651 things which are befitting, with all assiduity
both of the flesh and spirit. Be studious of unity, than which nothing is more precious. Bear
with all men, even as our Lord beareth with thee. Show patience652 with all men in love, as
[indeed] thou doest. Be stedfast in prayer. Ask for more understanding than that which
thou [already] hast. Be watchful, as possessing a spirit which sleepeth not. Speak with every
man according to the will of God. Bear the infirmities of all men as a perfect athlete; for
where the labour is great, the gain is also great.</p>

<head>Chapter II.</head>
<p>If thou lovest the good disciples only, thou hast no grace; [but] rather subdue those that
are evil by gentleness. All [sorts of] wounds are not healed by the same medicine. Mitigate
[the pain of] cutting653 by tenderness. Be wise as the serpent in everything, and innocent,
with respect to those things which are requisite, even as the dove. For this reason thou art
[composed] of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest entice654 those things which are visible
before thy face, and mayest ask, as to those which are concealed from thee, that they [too]
may be revealed to thee, in order that thou be deficient in nothing, and mayest abound in
all gifts. The time demands, even as a pilot does a ship, and as one who stands exposed to
the tempest does a haven, that thou shouldst be worthy of God. Be thou watchful as an
athlete of God. That which is promised to us is life eternal, which cannot be corrupted, of
which things thou art also persuaded. In everything I will be instead655 of thy soul, and my
bonds which thou hast loved.</p>
<note type="footnote">653 Cureton observes, as one alternative here, that “the Syrian translator seems to have read παράξυσμα for
παροξυσμούς.”</note>

<p>Let not those who seem to be somewhat, and teach strange doctrines, strike thee with
apprehension; but stand thou in the truth, as an athlete656 who is smitten, for it is [the part]
of a great athlete to be smitten, and [yet] conquer. More especially is it fitting that we should
bear everything for the sake of God, that He also may bear us. Be [still] more diligent than
thou yet art. Be discerning of the times. Look for Him that is above the times, Him who has
no times, Him who is invisible, Him who for our sakes became visible, Him who is impalpable,
Him who is impassible, Him who for our sakes suffered, Him who endured everything
in every form for our sakes.</p>

 <pb n="278"/>
<head>Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius</head>
<p>To the following introductory note of the translators nothing need be prefixed, except
a grateful acknowledgment of the value of their labours and of their good judgment in giving
us even these spurious writings for purposes of comparison. They have thus placed the
materials for a complete understanding of the whole subject, before students who have a
mind to subject it to a thorough and candid examination.</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>We formerly stated that eight out of the fifteen Epistles bearing the name of Ignatius
are now universally admitted to be spurious. None of them are quoted or referred to by any
ancient writer previous to the sixth century. The style, moreover, in which they are written,
so different from that of the other Ignatian letters, and allusions which they contain to heresies
and ecclesiastical arrangements of a much later date than that of their professed author,
render it perfectly certain that they are not the authentic production of the illustrious bishop
of Antioch.</p>
<p>We cannot tell when or by whom these Epistles were fabricated. They have been thought
to betray the same hand as the longer and interpolated form of the seven Epistles which are
generally regarded as genuine. And some have conceived that the writer who gave forth to
the world the Apostolic Constitutions under the name of Clement, was probably the author
of these letters falsely ascribed to Ignatius, as well as of the longer recension of the seven
Epistles which are mentioned by Eusebius.</p>
<p>It was a considerable time before editors in modern times began to discriminate between
the true and the false in the writings attributed to Ignatius. The letters first published under
his name were those three which exist only in Latin. These came forth in 1495 at Paris, being
appended to a life of Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Some three years later, eleven
Epistles, comprising those mentioned by Eusebius, and four others, were published in Latin,
and passed through four or five editions. In 1536, the whole of the professedly Ignatian letters
were published at Cologne in a Latin version; and this collection also passed through several
editions. It was not till 1557 that the Ignatian Epistles appeared for the first time in Greek
at Dillingen. After this date many editions came forth, in which the probably genuine were
still mixed up with the certainly spurious, the three Latin letters, only being rejected as
destitute of authority. Vedelius of Geneva first made the distinction which is now universally
accepted, in an edition of these Epistles which he published in 1623; and he was followed
by Archbishop Usher and others, who entered more fully into that critical examination of
these writings which has been continued down even to our own day.</p>

<pb n="279"/>
<p>The reader will have no difficulty in detecting the internal grounds on which these eight
letters are set aside as spurious. The difference of style from the other Ignatian writings will
strike him even in perusing the English version which we have given, while it is of course
much more marked in the original. And other decisive proofs present themselves in every
one of the Epistles. In that to the Tarsians there is found a plain allusion to the Sabellian
heresy, which did not arise till after the middle of the third century. In the Epistle to the
Antiochians there is an enumeration of various Church officers, who were certainly unknown
at the period when Ignatius lived. The Epistle to Hero plainly alludes to Manichæan errors,
and could not therefore have been written before the third century. There are equally decisive
proofs of spuriousness to be found in the Epistle to the Philippians, such as the references
it contains to the Patripassian heresy originated by Praxeas in the latter part of the second
century, and the ecclesiastical feasts, etc., of which it makes mention. The letter to Maria
Cassobolita is of a very peculiar style, utterly alien from that of the other Epistles ascribed
to Ignatius. And it is sufficient simply to glance at the short Epistles to St. John and the
Virgin Mary, in order to see that they carry the stamp of imposture on their front; and, indeed,
no sooner were they published than by almost universal consent they were rejected.</p>
<p>But though the additional Ignatian letters here given are confessedly spurious, we have
thought it not improper to present them to the English reader in an appendix to our first
volume.695 We have done so, because they have been so closely connected with the name
of the bishop of Antioch, and also because they are in themselves not destitute of interest.
We have, moreover, the satisfaction of thus placing for the first time within the reach of one
acquainted only with our language, all the materials that have entered into the protracted
agitation of the famous Ignatian controversy.</p>
<note type="footnote">695 [Spurious writings, if they can be traced to antiquity, are always useful. Sometimes they are evidence of
facts, always of opinions, ideas and fancies of their date; and often they enable us to identify the origin of corruptions.
Even interpolations prove what later partisans would be glad to find, if they could, in early writers.
They bear unwilling testimony to the absence of genuine evidence in favour of their assumptions.]</note>

and died in appearance; others that He is not the Son of the Creator, and others that He is
Himself God over all.701 Others, again, hold that He is a mere man, and others that this
flesh is not to rise again, so that our proper course is to live and partake of a life of pleasure,

<head>Chapter III.—The true doctrine respecting Christ.</head>
<p>Mindful of him, do ye by all means know that Jesus the Lord was truly born of Mary,
being made of a woman; and was as truly crucified. For, says he, “God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus.”706 And He really suffered, and died, and rose
again. For says [Paul], “If Christ should become passible, and should be the first to rise again
from the dead.”707 And again, “In that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He liveth,
He liveth unto God.”708 Otherwise, what advantage would there be in [becoming subject
to] bonds, if Christ has not died? what advantage in patience? what advantage in [enduring]
stripes? And why such facts as the following: Peter was crucified; Paul and James were slain
with the sword; John was banished to Patmos; Stephen was stoned to death by the Jews who
killed the Lord? But, [in truth,] none of these sufferings were in vain; for the Lord was really
crucified by the ungodly.</p>

<p>And [know ye, moreover], that He who was born of a woman was the Son of God, and

created all things. For says the apostle, “There is one God, the Father, of whom are all things;
and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.”710 And again, “For there is one God,
and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus;”711 and, “By Him were all
things created that are in heaven, and on earth, visible and invisible; and He is before all
things, and by Him all things consist.”712</p>

again, “When all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall He also Himself be subject
unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.”714 Wherefore it is one
[Person] who put all things under, and who is all in all, and another [Person] to whom they

with Him, forming [the world along with Him], and He rejoiced in me daily.”716 And how
could a mere man be addressed in such words as these: “Sit Thou at My right hand?”717
And how, again, could such an one declare: “Before Abraham was, I am?”718 And, “Glorify
Me with Thy glory which I had before the world was?”719 What man could ever say, “I came
down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me?”720 And of
what man could it be said, “He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world: He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew
Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not?”721 How could such a
one be a mere man, receiving the beginning of His existence from Mary, and not rather God
the Word, and the only-begotten Son? For “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God,722 and the Word was God.”723 And in another place, “The Lord created Me,
the beginning of His ways, for His ways, for His works. Before the world did He found Me,
and before all the hills did He beget Me.”724</p>

that the hour cometh, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son
of God; and they that hear shall live.”725 And [says] the apostle, “For this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”726 And that we must live
soberly and righteously, he [shows when he] says again, “Be not deceived: neither adulterers,
nor effeminate persons, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor fornicators, nor revilers,
nor drunkards, nor thieves, can inherit the kingdom of God.”727 And again, “If the dead
rise not, then is not Christ raised; our preaching therefore is vain, and your faith is also vain:
ye are yet in your sins. Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. If the dead rise not,
let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.”728 But if such be our condition and feelings,

Be not ashamed of servants, for we possess the same nature in common with them. Do
not hold women in abomination, for they have given thee birth, and brought thee up. It is
fitting, therefore, to love those that were the authors of our birth (but only in the Lord),
inasmuch as a man can produce no children without a woman. It is right, therefore, that
we should honour those who have had a part in giving us birth. “Neither is the man without
the woman, nor the woman without the man,”802 except in the case of those who were first
formed. For the body of Adam was made out of the four elements, and that of Eve out of
the side of Adam. And, indeed, the altogether peculiar birth of the Lord was of a virgin
alone. [This took place] not as if the lawful union [of man and wife] were abominable, but
such a kind of birth was fitting to God. For it became the Creator not to make use of the
ordinary method of generation, but of one that was singular and strange, as being the Creator.</p>

Christ, “of whom are all things;”819 and one Lord Jesus Christ, our [Lord], “by whom are
all things;”820 and also one Holy Spirit, who wrought821 in Moses, and in the prophets and
apostles; and also one baptism, which is administered that we should have fellowship with
the death of the Lord;822 and also one elect Church; there ought likewise to be but one faith
in respect to Christ. For “there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of
all, who is through all, and in all.”823</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Unity of the three divine persons.</head>
<p>There is then one God and Father, and not two or three; One who is; and there is no
other besides Him, the only true [God]. For “the Lord thy God,” saith [the Scripture], “is
one Lord.”824 And again, “Hath not one God created us? Have we not all one Father?825
And there is also one Son, God the Word. For “the only-begotten Son,” saith [the Scripture],
“who is in the bosom of the Father.”826 And again, “One Lord Jesus Christ.”827 And in another
place, “What is His name, or what His Son’s name, that we may know?”828 And there
is also one Paraclete.829 For “there is also,” saith [the Scripture], “one Spirit,”830 since “we
have been called in one hope of our calling.”831 And again, “We have drunk of one Spirit,”832
with what follows. And it is manifest that all these gifts [possessed by believers] “worketh
one and the self-same Spirit.”833 There are not then either three Fathers,834 or three Sons,
or three Paracletes, but one Father, and one Son, and one Paraclete. Wherefore also the
Lord, when He sent forth the apostles to make disciples of all nations, commanded them to
“baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”835 not unto one
[person] having three names, nor into three [persons] who became incarnate, but into three
possessed of equal honour.</p>

<p>Chapter III.—Christ was truly born, and died.
For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the Father nor the Paraclete,
but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance or imagination, but in reality. For “the
Word became flesh.”836 For “Wisdom builded for herself a house.”837 And God the Word
was born as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For [it is
written], “A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son.”838 He was then truly
born, truly grew up, truly ate and drank, was truly crucified, and died, and rose again. He
who believes these things, as they really were, and as they really took place, is blessed. He
who believeth them not is no less accursed than those who crucified the Lord. For the prince
of this world rejoiceth when any one denies the cross, since he knows that the confession
of the cross is his own destruction. For that is the trophy which has been raised up against
his power, which when he sees, he shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid.</p>

<p>Chapter IV.—The malignity and folly of Satan.
And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (Satan) was eager that it should be so; and
he “wrought” [for this end] “in the children of disobedience.”839 He wrought in Judas, in
the Pharisees, in the Sadducees, in the old, in the young, and in the priests. But when it was
just about to be erected, he was troubled, and infused repentance into the traitor, and
pointed him to a rope to hang himself with, and taught him [to die by] strangulation. He
terrified also the silly woman, disturbing her by dreams; and he, who had tried every means
to have the cross prepared, now endeavoured to put a stop to its erection;840 not that he
was influenced by repentance on account of the greatness of his crime (for in that case he
would not be utterly depraved), but because he perceived his own destruction [to be at
hand]. For the cross of Christ was the beginning of his condemnation, the beginning of his
death, the beginning of his destruction. Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should
deny the cross, be ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate and explain
away the birth of the Virgin, and calumniate the [human] nature841 itself as being abominable.
He fights along with the Jews to a denial of the cross, and with the Gentiles to the calumniating
of Mary,842 who are heretical in holding that Christ possessed a mere phantasmal
body.843 For the leader of all wickedness assumes manifold844 forms, beguiler of men as he
is, inconsistent, and even contradicting himself, projecting one course and then following
another. For he is wise to do evil, but as to what good may be he is totally ignorant. And
indeed he is full of ignorance, on account of his voluntary want of reason: for how can he
be deemed anything else who does not perceive reason when it lies at his very feet?</p>

<p>Seeing these things, thou wast in utter perplexity.853 And thou wast ignorant that it was

as well as the adoration of the Magi, and the appearance of the star. Thou didst revert to thy
state of [wilful] ignorance, because all the circumstances seemed to thee trifling;854 for thou
didst deem the swaddling-bands, the circumcision, and the nourishment by means of milk
contemptible:855 these things appeared to thee unworthy of God. Again, thou didst behold
a man who remained forty days and nights without tasting human food, along with ministering
angels at whose presence thou didst shudder, when first of all thou hadst seen Him
baptized as a common man, and knewest not the reason thereof. But after His [lengthened]
fast thou didst again assume thy wonted audacity, and didst tempt Him when hungry, as if
He had been an ordinary man, not knowing who He was. For thou saidst, “If thou be the
Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.”856 Now, this expression, “If thou
be the Son,” is an indication of ignorance. For if thou hadst possessed real knowledge, thou
wouldst have understood that the Creator can with equal ease both create what does not
exist, and change that which already has a being. And thou temptedst by means of hunger857
Him who nourisheth all that require food. And thou temptedst the very “Lord of glory,”858
forgetting in thy malevolence that “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” For if thou hadst known that He was the Son of
God, thou wouldst also have understood that He who had kept his859 body from feeling
any want for forty days and as many nights, could have also done the same for ever. Why,
then, does He suffer hunger? In order to prove that He had assumed a body subject to the
same feelings as those of ordinary men. By the first fact He showed that He was God, and
by the second that He was also man. </p>

<p>If, therefore, thou art trodden down under the feet of the Lord, how dost thou tempt
Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of the lawgiver, “Thou shall not tempt
the Lord thy God?”865 Yea, thou even darest, most accursed one, to appropriate the works
of God to thyself, and to declare that the dominion over these was delivered to thee.866 And
thou dost set forth thine own fall as an example to the Lord, and dost promise to give Him
what is really His own, if He would fall down and worship thee.867 And how didst thou not
shudder, O thou spirit more wicked through thy malevolence than all other wicked spirits,
to utter such words against the Lord? Through thine appetite868 wast thou overcome, and
through thy vainglory wast thou brought to dishonour: through avarice and ambition dost
thou [now] draw on [others] to ungodliness. Thou, O Belial, dragon, apostate, crooked
serpent, rebel against God, outcast from Christ, alien from the Holy Spirit, exile from the
ranks of the angels, reviler of the laws of God, enemy of all that is lawful, who didst rise up
against the first-formed of men, and didst drive forth [from obedience to] the commandment
[of God] those who had in no respect injured thee; thou who didst raise up against Abel the
murderous Cain; thou who didst take arms against Job: dost thou say to the Lord, “If Thou
wilt fall down and worship me?” Oh what audacity! Oh what madness! Thou runaway slave,
thou incorrigible869 slave, dost thou rebel against the good Lord? Dost thou say to so great

and worship me?”</p>

malevolence, thou hast been called. For I know Who I am, and by Whom I have been sent,

to the deacons. Love one another in the Lord, as being the images of God. Take heed, ye
husbands, that ye love your wives as your own members. Ye wives also, love your husbands,
as being one with them in virtue of your union. If any one lives in chastity or continence,
let him not be lifted up, lest he lose his reward. Do not lightly esteem the festivals. Despise
not the period of forty days, for it comprises an imitation of the conduct of the Lord. After
the week of the passion, do not neglect to fast on the fourth and sixth days, distributing at
the same time of thine abundance to the poor. If any one fasts on the Lord’s Day or on the

vigorous old men,884 showing them that they were abandoned wretches, and not [worthy
to be reckoned] elders, and that, though Jews by extraction, they were Canaanites in practice.
And Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a prophet entrusted
to him by God, was addressed in these words: “Say not, I am a youth; for thou shalt go to
all those to whom I send thee, and thou shalt speak according to all that I command thee;
because I am with thee.”885 And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his
age,886 had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of the two
women,887 when it was unknown to whom these respectively belonged; so that the whole
people were astonished at such wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere
youth, but a full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the
Ethiopians, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility], in such a

the place where sacrifices were offered with dead bodies, and throws down the temples, and
cuts down the groves, and breaks in pieces the pillars, and breaks open the tombs of the
ungodly, that not a relic of the wicked might any longer exist.889 To such an extent did he

[the mother] of Jesus, and wish day by day to run off from us to you, that they may meet

of her respecting some rather secret matters. But Salome also, [the daughter of Anna,] whom
thou lovest, who stayed with her five months at Jerusalem, and some other well-known
persons, relate that she is full of all graces and all virtues, after the manner of a virgin,
fruitful in virtue and grace. And, as they report, she is cheerful in persecutions and afflictions,
free from murmuring in the midst of penury and want, grateful to those that injure her, and
rejoices when exposed to troubles: she sympathizes with the wretched and the afflicted as
sharing in their afflictions, and is not slow to come to their assistance. Moreover, she shines
forth gloriously as contending in the fight of faith against the pernicious conflicts of vicious903
principles or conduct. She is the lady of our new religion and repentance,904 and the handmaid
among the faithful of all works of piety. She is indeed devoted to the humble, and she
humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully magnified by all, while
at the same time she suffers detraction from the Scribes and Pharisees. Besides these points,
many relate to us numerous other things regarding her. We do not, however, go so far as
to believe all in every particular; nor do we mention such to thee. But, as we are informed

<head>Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Ignatius</head>
<p>The learned dissertation of Pearson, on the difficulties of reconciling the supposed year
of the martyrdom with the history of Trajan, etc., is given entire in Jacobson (vol. ii. p. 524),
against the decision of Usher for a.d. 107. Pearson accepts a.d. 116. Consult also the preface
of Dr. Thomas Smith,914 in the same work (p. 518), on the text of the original and of the
Latin versions, and on the credibility of the narrative. Our learned translators seem to think
the text they have used, to be without interpolation. If the simple-minded faithful of those
days, so near the age of miracles, appear to us, in some degree, enthusiasts, let us remember
the vision of Col. Gardiner, accredited by Doddridge, Lord Lyttleton’s vision (see Boswell,
anno 1784, chap. xi.), accepted by Johnson and his contemporaries, and the interesting
narrative of the pious Mr. Tennent of New Jersey, attested by so many excellent and intelligent
persons, almost of our own times.</p>
<p>The following is the Introductory Notice of the translators:—
The following account of the martyrdom of Ignatius professes, in several passages, to
have been written by those who accompanied him on his voyage to Rome, and were present
on the occasion of his death (chaps. v. vi. vii.). And if the genuineness of this narrative, as
well as of the Ignatian Epistles, be admitted, there can be little doubt that the persons in
question were Philo and Agathopus, with Crocus perhaps, all of whom are mentioned by
Ignatius (Epist. to Smyr., chap. x.; to Philad., chap. xi.; to Rom., chap. x.) as having attended
him on that journey to Rome which resulted in his martyrdom. But doubts have been started,
by Daillé and others, as to the date and authorship of this account. Some of these rest upon
internal considerations, but the weightiest objection is found in the fact that no reference
to this narrative is to be traced during the first six centuries of our era.915 This is certainly
a very suspicious circumstance, and may well give rise to some hesitation in ascribing the
authorship to the immediate companions and friends of Ignatius. On the other hand, however,
this account of the death of Ignatius is in perfect harmony with the particulars recounted
by Eusebius and Chrysostom regarding him. Its comparative simplicity, too, is greatly in
its favour. It makes no reference to the legends which by and by connected themselves with
the name of Ignatius. As is well known, he came in course of time to be identified with the
child whom Christ (Matt. xviii. 2) set before His disciples as a pattern of humility. It was

one carried by God. But in chap. ii. of the following narrative we find the term explained to

 <head>Chapter I.—Desire of Ignatius for martyrdom.</head>
<p>When Trajan, not long since,918 succeeded to the empire of the Romans, Ignatius, the
disciple of John the apostle, a man in all respects of an apostolic character, governed the
Church of the Antiochians with great care, having with difficulty escaped the former storms
of the many persecutions under Domitian, inasmuch as, like a good pilot, by the helm of
prayer and fasting, by the earnestness of his teaching, and by his [constant919] spiritual labour,
he resisted the flood that rolled against him, fearing [only] lest he should lose any of those
who were deficient in courage, or apt to suffer from their simplicity.920 Wherefore he rejoiced
over the tranquil state of the Church, when the persecution ceased for a little time, but was
grieved as to himself, that he had not yet attained to a true love to Christ, nor reached the
perfect rank of a disciple. For he inwardly reflected, that the confession which is made by
martyrdom, would bring him into a yet more intimate relation to the Lord. Wherefore,
continuing a few years longer with the Church, and, like a divine lamp, enlightening every
one’s understanding by his expositions of the [Holy921] Scriptures, he [at length] attained
the object of his desire.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Ignatius is condemned by Trajan.</head>
<p>For Trajan, in the ninth922 year of his reign, being lifted up [with pride], after the victory
he had gained over the Scythians and Dacians, and many other nations, and thinking that
the religious body of the Christians were yet wanting to complete the subjugation of all
things to himself, and [thereupon] threatening them with persecution unless they should
agree to923 worship dæmons, as did all other nations, thus compelled924 all who were living
godly lives either to sacrifice [to idols] or die. Wherefore the noble soldier of Christ [Ignatius],
being in fear for the Church of the Antiochians, was, in accordance with his own desire,
brought before Trajan, who was at that time staying at Antioch, but was in haste [to set
forth] against Armenia and the Parthians. And when he was set before the emperor Trajan,
[that prince] said unto him, “Who art thou, wicked wretch,925 who settest926 thyself to
transgress our commands, and persuadest others to do the same, so that they should
miserably perish?” Ignatius replied, “No one ought to call Theophorus927 wicked; for all
evil spirits928 have departed from the servants of God. But if, because I am an enemy to
these [spirits], you call me wicked in respect to them, I quite agree with you; for inasmuch
as I have Christ the King of heaven [within me], I destroy all the devices of these [evil spirits].”
Trajan answered, “And who is Theophorus?” Ignatius replied, “He who has Christ within
his breast.” Trajan said, “Do we not then seem to you to have the gods in our mind, whose
assistance we enjoy in fighting against our enemies?” Ignatius answered, “Thou art in error
when thou callest the dæmons of the nations gods. For there is but one God, who made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are in them; and one Jesus Christ, the only-begotten
Son of God, whose kingdom may I enjoy.” Trajan said, “Do you mean Him who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate?” Ignatius replied, “I mean Him who crucified my sin, with
him who was the inventor of it,929 and who has condemned [and cast down] all the deceit
and malice of the devil under the feet of those who carry Him in their heart.” Trajan said,
“Dost thou then carry within thee Him that was crucified?” Ignatius replied, “Truly so; for

it is written, ‘I will dwell in them, and walk in them.’ ”930 Then Trajan pronounced sentence
as follows: “We command that Ignatius, who affirms that he carries about within him Him
that was crucified, be bound by soldiers, and carried to the great [city] Rome, there to be
devoured by the beasts, for the gratification of the people.” When the holy martyr heard
this sentence, he cried out with joy, “I thank thee, O Lord, that Thou hast vouchsafed to
honour me with a perfect love towards Thee, and hast made me to be bound with iron
chains, like931 Thy Apostle Paul.” Having spoken thus, he then, with delight, clasped the
chains about him; and when he had first prayed for the Church, and commended it with
tears to the Lord, he was hurried away by the savage cruelty932 of the soldiers, like a distinguished
ram933 the leader of a goodly flock, that he might be carried to Rome, there to furnish

<p>Wherefore, with great alacrity and joy, through his desire to suffer, he came down from
Antioch to Seleucia, from which place he set sail. And after a great deal of suffering he came
to Smyrna, where he disembarked with great joy, and hastened to see the holy Polycarp,
[formerly] his fellow-disciple, and [now] bishop of Smyrna. For they had both, in old times,
been disciples of St. John the Apostle. Being then brought to him, and having communicated
to him some spiritual gifts, and glorying in his bonds, he entreated of him to labour934 along
with him for the fulfilment of his desire; earnestly indeed asking this of the whole Church
(for the cities and Churches of Asia had welcomed935 the holy man through their bishops,
and presbyters, and deacons, all hastening to meet him, if by any means they might receive
from him some936 spiritual gift), but above all, the holy Polycarp, that, by means of the wild

of thanksgiving to them, which dropped spiritual grace, along with prayer and exhortation.
Wherefore, seeing all men so kindly affected towards him, and fearing lest the love of the
brotherhood should hinder his zeal towards the Lord,939 while a fair door of suffering

was pressed by the soldiers to hasten to the public spectacles in the mighty [city]
Rome, that, being given up to the wild beasts in the sight of the Roman people, he might
attain to the crown for which he strove), he [next] landed at Troas. Then, going on from
that place to Neapolis, he went [on foot] by Philippi through Macedonia, and on to that
part of Epirus which is near Epidamnus; and finding a ship in one of the seaports, he sailed
over the Adriatic Sea, and entering from it on the Tyrrhene, he passed by the various islands
and cities, until, when Puteoli came in sight, he was eager there to disembark, having a desire
to tread in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul.941 But a violent wind arising did not suffer him
to do so, the ship being driven rapidly forwards;942 and, simply expressing his delight943
over the love of the brethren in that place, he sailed by. Wherefore, continuing to enjoy fair
winds, we were reluctantly hurried on in one day and a night, mourning [as we did] over
the coming departure from us of this righteous man. But to him this happened just as he
wished, since he was in haste as soon as possible to leave this world, that he might attain to
the Lord whom he loved. Sailing then into the Roman harbour, and the unhallowed sports
being just about to close, the soldiers began to be annoyed at our slowness, but the bishop

<p>They pushed forth therefore from the place which is called Portus;944 and (the945 fame
of all relating to the holy martyr being already spread abroad) we met the brethren full of
fear and joy; rejoicing indeed because they were thought worthy to meet with Theophorus,
but struck with fear because so eminent a man was being led to death. Now he enjoined
some to keep silence who, in their fervent zeal, were saying946 that they would appease the
people, so that they should not demand the destruction of this just one. He being immediately
aware of this through the Spirit,947 and having saluted them all, and begged of them to show
a true affection towards him, and having dwelt [on this point] at greater length than in his
Epistle,948 and having persuaded them not to envy him hastening to the Lord, he then, after
he had, with all the brethren kneeling [beside him], entreated the Son of God in behalf of
the Churches, that a stop might be put to the persecution, and that mutual love might continue
among the brethren, was led with all haste into the amphitheatre. Then, being immediately
thrown in, according to the command of Cæsar given some time ago, the public
spectacles being just about to close (for it was then a solemn day, as they deemed it, being
that which is called the thirteenth949 in the Roman tongue, on which the people were wont
to assemble in more than ordinary numbers950), he was thus cast to the wild beasts close
beside the temple,951 that so by them the desire of the holy martyr Ignatius should be fulfilled,
according to that which is written, “The desire of the righteous is acceptable952 [to God],”
to the effect that he might not be troublesome to any of the brethren by the gathering of his
remains, even as he had in his Epistle expressed a wish beforehand that so his end might
be. For only the harder portions of his holy remains were left, which were conveyed to Antioch
and wrapped953 in linen, as an inestimable treasure left to the holy Church by the

 <div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introductory Note to the Epistle of Barnabas</head>
<p>[a.d. 100.] The writer of this Epistle is supposed to have been an Alexandrian Jew of the
times of Trajan and Hadrian. He was a layman; but possibly he bore the name of “Barnabas,”
and so has been confounded with his holy and apostolic name-sire. It is more probable that
the Epistle, being anonymous, was attributed to St. Barnabas, by those who supposed that
apostle to be the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and who discovered similarities in
the plan and purpose of the two works. It is with great reluctance that I yield to modern
scholars, in dismissing the ingenious and temperate argument of Archbishop Wake1 for
the apostolic origin of this treatise. The learned Lardner2 shares his convictions; and the
very interesting and ingenious views of Jones3 never appeared to me satisfactory, weighed
with preponderating arguments, on the other side.4</p>
<p>The Maccabæan spirit of the Jews never burned more furiously than after the destruction
of Jerusalem, and while it was kindling the conflagration that broke out under Barchochebas,
and blazed so terribly in the insurrection against Hadrian.5 It is not credible that the Jewish
Christians at Alexandria and elsewhere were able to emancipate themselves from their national
spirit; and accordingly the old Judaizing, which St. Paul had anathematized and
confuted, would assert itself again. If such was the occasion of this Epistle, as I venture to
suppose, a higher character must be ascribed to it than could otherwise be claimed. This
accounts, also, for the degree of favour with which it was accepted by the primitive faithful.</p>
<p>It is interesting as a specimen of their conflicts with a persistent Judaism which St. Paul
had defeated and anathematized, but which was ever cropping out among believers originally
of the Hebrews.6 Their own habits of allegorizing, and their Oriental tastes, must be borne
in mind, if we are readily disgusted with our author’s fancies and refinements. St. Paul
himself pays a practical tribute to their modes of thought, in his Epistle to the Galatians iv.
24. This is the ad hominem form of rhetoric, familiar to all speakers, which laid even the
apostle open to the slander of enemies (2 Cor. xii. 16),—that he was “crafty,” and caught
men with guile. It is interesting to note the more Occidental spirit of Cyprian, as compared
with our author, when he also contends with Judaism. Doubtless we have in the pseudo-

Barnabas something of that oeconomy which is always capable of abuse, and which was
destined too soon to overleap the bounds of its moral limitations.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that this writer sometimes speaks as a Gentile, a fact which some
have found it difficult to account for, on the supposition that he was a Hebrew, if not a Levite
as well. But so, also, St. Paul sometimes speaks as a Roman, and sometimes as a Jew; and,
owing to the mixed character of the early Church, he writes to the Romans iv. 1 as if they
were all Israelites, and again to the same Church (Rom. xi. 13) as if they were all Gentiles.
So this writer sometimes identifies himself with Jewish thought as a son of Abraham, and
again speaks from the Christian position as if he were a Gentile, thus identifying himself
with the catholicity of the Church.</p>
<p>But the subject thus opened is vast; and “the Epistle of Barnabas,” so called, still awaits
a critical editor, who at the same time shall be a competent expositor. Nobody can answer
these requisitions, who is unable, for this purpose, to be a Christian of the days of Trajan.</p>
<p>But it will be observed that this version has great advantages over any of its predecessor,
and is a valuable acquisition to the student. The learned translators have had before them
the entire Greek text of the fourth century, disfigured it is true by corruptions, but still very
precious, the rather as they have been able to compare it with the text of Hilgenfeld. Their
editorial notes are sufficient for our own plan; and little has been left for me to do, according
to the scheme of this publication, save to revise the “copy” for printing. I am glad to presume
no further into such a labyrinth, concerning which the learned and careful Wake modestly
professes, “I have endeavoured to attain to the sense of my author, and to make him as plain
and easy as I was able. If in anything I have chanced to mistake him, I have only this to say
for myself: that he must be better acquainted with the road than I pretend to be, who will
undertake to travel so long a journey in the dark and never to miss his way.”</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>Nothing certain is known as to the author of the following Epistle. The writer’s name
is Barnabas, but scarcely any scholars now ascribe it to the illustrious friend and companion
of St. Paul. External and internal evidence here come into direct collision. The ancient writers
who refer to this Epistle unanimously attribute it to Barnabas the Levite, of Cyprus, who
held such an honourable place in the infant Church. Clement of Alexandria does so again
and again (Strom., ii. 6, ii. 7, etc.). Origen describes it as “a Catholic Epistle” (Cont. Cels., i.
63), and seems to rank it among the Sacred Scriptures (Comm. in Rom., i. 24). Other statements
have been quoted from the fathers, to show that they held this to be an authentic
production of the apostolic Barnabas; and certainly no other name is ever hinted at in
Christian antiquity as that of the writer. But notwithstanding this, the internal evidence is
now generally regarded as conclusive against this opinion. On perusing the Epistle, the
reader will be in circumstances to judge of this matter for himself. He will be led to consider
whether the spirit and tone of the writing, as so decidedly opposed to all respect for Juda-

<pb n="367"/>
ism—the numerous inaccuracies which it contains with respect to Mosaic enactments and
observances —the absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture which it suggests—and
the many silly vaunts of superior knowledge in which its writer indulges—can possibly
comport with its ascription to the fellow—labourer of St. Paul. When it is remembered that
no one ascribes the Epistle to the apostolic Barnabas till the times of Clement of Alexandria,
and that it is ranked by Eusebius among the “spurious” writings, which, however much
known and read in the Church, were never regarded as authoritative, little doubt can remain
that the external evidence is of itself weak, and should not make us hesitate for a moment
in refusing to ascribe this writing to Barnabas the Apostle.</p>
<p>The date, object, and intended reader of the Epistle can only be doubtfully inferred from
some statements which it contains. It was clearly written after the destruction of Jerusalem,
since reference is made to that event (chap. xvi.), but how long after is matter of much dispute.
The general opinion is, that its date is not later than the middle of the second century, and
that it cannot be placed earlier than some twenty or thirty years before. In point of style,
both as respects thought and expression, a very low place must be assigned it. We know
nothing certain of the region in which the author lived, or where the first readers were to
be found. The intention of the writer, as he himself states (chap. i), was “to perfect the
knowledge” of those to whom he wrote. Hilgenfeld, who has devoted much attention to this
Epistle, holds that “it was written at the close of the first century by a Gentile Christian of
the school of Alexandria, with the view of winning back, or guarding from a Judaic form of
Christianity, those Christians belonging to the same class as himself.”</p>
<p>Until the recent discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, the first four and a
half chapters were known only in an ancient Latin version. The whole Greek text is now
happily recovered, though it is in many places very corrupt. We have compared its readings
throughout, and noted the principal variations from the text represented in our version.
We have also made frequent reference to the text adopted by Hilgenfeld in his recent edition
of the Epistle (Lipsiæ, T. O. Weigel, 1886).</p>

and above measure in your happy and honoured spirits, because ye have with such effect
received the engrafted10 spiritual gift. Wherefore also I inwardly rejoice the more, hoping
to be saved, because I truly perceive in you the Spirit poured forth from the rich Lord11 of
love. Your greatly desired appearance has thus filled me with astonishment over you.12 I
am therefore persuaded of this, and fully convinced in my own mind, that since I began to

way of righteousness. I am also on this account bound13 by the strictest obligation to love
you above my own soul, because great are the faith and love dwelling in you, while you hope
for the life which He has promised.14 Considering this, therefore, that if I should take the
trouble to communicate to you some portion of what I have myself received, it will prove
to me a sufficient reward that I minister to such spirits, I have hastened briefly to write unto
you, in order that, along with your faith, ye might have perfect knowledge. The doctrines
of the Lord, then, are three:15 the hope of life, the beginning and the completion of it. For
the Lord hath made known to us by the prophets both the things which are past and present,

<head>Chapter II.—The Jewish sacrifices are now abolished.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, the days are evil, and Satan19 possesses the power of this world, we
ought to give heed to ourselves, and diligently inquire into the ordinances of the Lord. Fear
and patience, then, are helpers of our faith; and long-suffering and continence are things
which fight on our side. While these remain pure in what respects the Lord, Wisdom, Understanding,
Science, and Knowledge rejoice along with them.20 For He hath revealed to
us by all the prophets that He needs neither sacrifices, nor burnt-offerings, nor oblations,
saying thus, “What is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me, saith the Lord? I am full of
burnt-offerings, and desire not the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats, not when
ye come to appear before Me: for who hath required these things at your hands? Tread no
more My courts, not though ye bring with you fine flour. Incense is a vain abomination
unto Me, and your new moons and sabbaths I cannot endure.”21 He has therefore abolished
these things, that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity,
might have a human oblation.22 And again He says to them, “Did I command your fathers,
when they went out from the land of Egypt, to offer unto Me burnt-offerings and sacrifices?
But this rather I commanded them, Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against
his neighbour, and love not an oath of falsehood.”23 We ought therefore, being possessed
of understanding, to perceive the gracious intention of our Father; for He speaks to us, desirous
that we, not24 going astray like them, should ask how we may approach Him. To us,
then, He declares, “A sacrifice [pleasing] to God is a broken spirit; a smell of sweet savour
to the Lord is a heart that glorifieth Him that made it.”25 We ought therefore, brethren,
carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one, having made his entrance
by deceit, should hurl26 us forth from our [true] life.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The fasts of the Jews are not true fasts, nor acceptable to God.</head>
<p>He says then to them again concerning these things, “Why do ye fast to Me as on this
day, saith the Lord, that your voice should be heard with a cry? I have not chosen this fast,
saith the Lord, that a man should humble his soul. Nor, though ye bend your neck like a
ring, and put upon you sackcloth and ashes, will ye call it an acceptable fast.”27 To us He
saith, “Behold, this is the fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord, not that a man should
humble his soul, but that he should loose every band of iniquity, untie the fastenings of
harsh agreements, restore to liberty them that are bruised, tear in pieces every unjust engagement,
feed the hungry with thy bread, clothe the naked when thou seest him, bring the
homeless into thy house, not despise the humble if thou behold him, and not [turn away]
from the members of thine own family. Then shall thy dawn break forth, and thy healing
shall quickly spring up, and righteousness shall go forth before thee, and the glory of God
shall encompass thee; and then thou shalt call, and God shall hear thee; whilst thou art yet
speaking, He shall say, Behold, I am with thee; if thou take away from thee the chain
[binding others], and the stretching forth of the hands28 [to swear falsely], and words of
murmuring, and give cheerfully thy bread to the hungry, and show compassion to the soul
that has been humbled.”29 To this end, therefore, brethren, He is long-suffering, foreseeing
how the people whom He has prepared shall with guilelessness believe in His Beloved. For
He revealed all these things to us beforehand, that we should not rush forward as rash acceptors
of their laws.30</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Antichrist is at hand: let us therefore avoid Jewish errors.</head>
<p>It therefore behoves us, who inquire much concerning events at hand,31 to search diligently
into those things which are able to save us. Let us then utterly flee from all the works
of iniquity, lest these should take hold of us; and let us hate the error of the present time,
that we may set our love on the world to come: let us not give loose reins to our soul, that
it should have power to run with sinners and the wicked, lest we become like them. The final
stumbling-block (or source of danger) approaches, concerning which it is written, as Enoch32
says, “For for this end the Lord has cut short the times and the days, that His Beloved may
hasten; and He will come to the inheritance.” And the prophet also speaks thus: “Ten kingdoms
shall reign upon the earth, and a little king shall rise up after them, who shall subdue
under one three of the kings.”33 In like manner Daniel says concerning the same, “And I
beheld the fourth beast, wicked and powerful, and more savage than all the beasts of the
earth, and how from it sprang up ten horns, and out of them a little budding horn, and how
it subdued under one three of the great horns.”34 Ye ought therefore to understand. And
this also I further beg of you, as being one of you, and loving you both individually and
collectively more than my own soul, to take heed now to yourselves, and not to be like some,
adding largely to your sins, and saying, “The covenant is both theirs and ours.”35 But they
thus finally lost it, after Moses had already received it. For the Scripture saith, “And Moses
was fasting in the mount forty days and forty nights, and received the covenant from the
Lord, tables of stone written with the finger of the hand of the Lord;”36 but turning away to
idols, they lost it. For the Lord speaks thus to Moses: “Moses go down quickly; for the people
whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt have transgressed.”37 And Moses understood
[the meaning of God], and cast the two tables out of his hands; and their covenant
was broken, in order that the covenant of the beloved Jesus might be sealed upon our heart,
in the hope which flows from believing in Him.38 Now, being desirous to write many things

earnest40 heed in these last days; for the whole [past] time of your faith will profit you
nothing, unless now in this wicked time we also withstand coming sources of danger, as
becometh the sons of God. That the Black One41 may find no means of entrance, let us flee
from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of the way of wickedness. Do not, by retiring
apart, live a solitary life, as if you were already [fully] justified; but coming together in one
place, make common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare. For the
Scripture saith, “Woe to them who are wise to themselves, and prudent in their own sight!”42
Let us be spiritually-minded: let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us
meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in
His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of persons. Each will receive
as he has done: if he is righteous, his righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward
of wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the
called [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring power
over us, should thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord. And all the more attend to
this, my brethren, when ye reflect and behold, that after so great signs and wonders were
wrought in Israel, they were thus [at length] abandoned. Let us beware lest we be found
[fulfilling that saying], as it is written, “Many are called, but few are chosen.”43</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The new covenant, founded on the sufferings of Christ, tends to
our salvation, but to the Jews’ destruction.</head>
<p>For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up His flesh to corruption, that we might
be sanctified through the remission of sins, which is effected by His blood of sprinkling. For
it is written concerning Him, partly with reference to Israel, and partly to us; and [the
Scripture] saith thus: “He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our
iniquities: with His stripes we are healed. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and
as a lamb which is dumb before its shearer.”44 Therefore we ought to be deeply grateful to
the Lord, because He has both made known to us things that are past, and hath given us
wisdom concerning things present, and hath not left us without understanding in regard
to things which are to come. Now, the Scripture saith, “Not unjustly are nets spread out for
birds.”45 This means that the man perishes justly, who, having a knowledge of the way of
righteousness, rushes off into the way of darkness. And further, my brethren: if the Lord
endured to suffer for our soul, He being Lord of all the world, to whom God said at the
foundation of the world, “Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness,”46 understand
how it was that He endured to suffer at the hand of men. The prophets, having
obtained grace from Him, prophesied concerning Him. And He (since it behoved Him to
appear in flesh), that He might abolish death, and reveal the resurrection from the dead,
endured [what and as He did], in order that He might fulfil the promise made unto the
fathers, and by preparing a new people for Himself, might show, while He dwelt on earth,
that He, when He has raised mankind, will also judge them. Moreover, teaching Israel, and
doing so great miracles and signs, He preached [the truth] to him, and greatly loved him.
But when He chose His own apostles who were to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among
those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came “not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.”47 Then He manifested Himself to be the Son of God. For if He
had not come in the flesh, how could men have been saved by beholding Him?48 Since
looking upon the sun which is to cease to exist, and is the work of His hands, their eyes are
not able to bear his rays. The Son of God therefore came in the flesh with this view, that He
might bring to a head the sum of their sins who had persecuted His prophets49 to the death.
For this purpose, then, He endured. For God saith, “The stroke of his flesh is from them;”50

<p>When, therefore, He has fulfilled the commandment, what saith He? “Who is he that

Me? let him draw near to the servant of the Lord.”56 “Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax old,
like a garment, and the moth shall eat you up.”57 And again the prophet says, “Since58 as a
mighty stone He is laid for crushing, behold I cast down for the foundations of Zion a stone,
precious, elect, a corner-stone, honourable.” Next, what says He? “And he who shall trust59
in it shall live for ever.” Is our hope, then, upon a stone? Far from it. But [the language is
used] inasmuch as He laid his flesh [as a foundation] with power; for He says, “And He

“The assembly of the wicked surrounded me; they encompassed me as bees do a honeycomb,”

state, for the formation of Adam was from the face of the earth. What, then, meaneth this:
“into the good land, a land flowing with milk and honey?” Blessed be our Lord, who has
placed in us wisdom and understanding of secret things. For the prophet says, “Who shall
understand the parable of the Lord, except him who is wise and prudent, and who loves his
Lord?”71 Since, therefore, having renewed us by the remission of our sins, He hath made
us after another pattern, [it is His purpose] that we should possess the soul of children,
inasmuch as He has created us anew by His Spirit.72 For the Scripture says concerning us,
while He speaks to the Son, “Let Us make man after Our image, and after Our likeness; and
let them have dominion over the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes
of the sea.”73 And the Lord said, on beholding the fair creature74 man, “Increase, and multiply,
and replenish the earth.”75 These things [were spoken] to the Son. Again, I will show
thee how, in respect to us,76 He has accomplished a second fashioning in these last days.
The Lord says, “Behold, I will make77 the last like the first.”78 In reference to this, then, the
prophet proclaimed, “Enter ye into the land flowing with milk and honey, and have
dominion over it.”79 Behold, therefore, we have been refashioned, as again He says in another
prophet, “Behold, saith the Lord, I will take away from these, that is, from those whom the
Spirit of the Lord foresaw, their stony hearts, and I will put hearts of flesh within them,”80
because He81 was to be manifested in flesh, and to sojourn among us. For, my brethren, the

and then by milk, so also we, being quickened and kept alive by the faith of the promise and

<head>Chapter VII.—Fasting, and the goat sent away, were types of Christ.</head>
<p>Understand, then, ye children of gladness, that the good Lord has foreshown all things
to us, that we might know to whom we ought for everything to render thanksgiving and
praise. If therefore the Son of God, who is Lord [of all things], and who will judge the living
and the dead, suffered, that His stroke might give us life, let us believe that the Son of God
could not have suffered except for our sakes. Moreover, when fixed to the cross, He had
given Him to drink vinegar and gall. Hearken how the priests of the people90 gave previous
indications of this. His commandment having been written, the Lord enjoined, that whosoever
did not keep the fast should be put to death, because He also Himself was to offer in
sacrifice for our sins the vessel of the Spirit, in order that the type established in Isaac when
he was offered upon the altar might be fully accomplished. What, then, says He in the
prophet? “And let them eat of the goat which is offered, with fasting, for all their sins.”91
Attend carefully: “And let all the priests alone eat the inwards, unwashed with vinegar.”
Wherefore? Because to me, who am to offer my flesh for the sins of my new people, ye are
to give gall with vinegar to drink: eat ye alone, while the people fast and mourn in sackcloth
and ashes. [These things were done] that He might show that it was necessary for Him to
suffer for them.92 How,93 then, ran the commandment? Give your attention. Take two goats
of goodly aspect, and similar to each other, and offer them. And let the priest take one as a
burnt-offering for sins.94 And what should they do with the other? “Accursed,” says He, “is
the one.” Mark how the type of Jesus95 now comes out. “And all of you spit upon it, and
pierce it, and encircle its head with scarlet wool, and thus let it be driven into the wilderness.”
And when all this has been done, he who bears the goat brings it into the desert, and takes
the wool off from it, and places that upon a shrub which is called Rachia,96 of which also
we are accustomed to eat the fruits97 when we find them in the field. Of this98 kind of shrub

the goat. Behold, then,101 the type of Jesus who was to suffer. But why is it that they place
the wool in the midst of thorns? It is a type of Jesus set before the view of the Church.
[They102 place the wool among thorns], that any one who wishes to bear it away may find
it necessary to suffer much, because the thorn is formidable, and thus obtain it only as the
result of suffering. Thus also, says He, “Those who wish to behold Me, and lay hold of My
kingdom, must through tribulation and suffering obtain Me.”103</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The red heifer a type of Christ.</head>
<p>Now what do you suppose this to be a type of, that a command was given to Israel, that
men of the greatest wickedness104 should offer a heifer, and slay and burn it, and, that then
boys should take the ashes, and put these into vessels, and bind round a stick105 purple wool
along with hyssop, and that thus the boys should sprinkle the people, one by one, in order
that they might be purified from their sins? Consider how He speaks to you with simplicity.
The calf106 is Jesus: the sinful men offering it are those who led Him to the slaughter. But
now the men are no longer guilty, are no longer regarded as sinners.107 And the boys that
sprinkle are those that have proclaimed to us the remission of sins and purification of heart.
To these He gave authority to preach the Gospel, being twelve in number, corresponding
to the twelve tribes108 of Israel. But why are there three boys that sprinkle? To correspond109
to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, because these were great with God. And why was the
wool [placed] upon the wood? Because by wood Jesus holds His kingdom, so that [through
the cross] those believing on Him shall live for ever. But why was hyssop joined with the
wool? Because in His kingdom the days will be evil and polluted in which we shall be saved,
[and] because he who suffers in body is cured through the cleansing110 efficacy of hyssop.
And on this account the things which stand thus are clear to us, but obscure to them because
they did not hear the voice of the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The spiritual meaning of circumcision.</head>
<p>He speaks moreover concerning our ears, how He hath circumcised both them and our
heart. The Lord saith in the prophet, “In the hearing of the ear they obeyed me.”111 And
again He saith, “By hearing, those shall hear who are afar off; they shall know what I have
done.”112 And, “Be ye circumcised in your hearts, saith the Lord.”113 And again He says,
“Hear, O Israel, for these things saith the Lord thy God.”114 And once more the Spirit of
the Lord proclaims, “Who is he that wishes to live for ever? By hearing let him hear the voice
of my servant.”115 And again He saith, “Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for God116
hath spoken.”117 These are in proof.118 And again He saith, “Hear the word of the Lord, ye
rulers of this people.”119 And again He saith, “Hear, ye children, the voice of one crying in
the wilderness.”120 Therefore He hath circumcised our ears, that we might hear His word
and believe, for the circumcision in which they trusted is abolished.121 For He declared that
circumcision was not of the flesh, but they transgressed because an evil angel deluded
them.122 He saith to them, “These things saith the Lord your God”—(here123 I find a new124
commandment)—“Sow not among thorns, but circumcise yourselves to the Lord.”125 And
why speaks He thus: “Circumcise the stubbornness of your heart, and harden not your
neck?”126 And again: “Behold, saith the Lord, all the nations are uncircumcised127 in the
flesh, but this people are uncircumcised in heart.”128 But thou wilt say, “Yea, verily the
people are circumcised for a seal.” But so also is every Syrian and Arab, and all the priests

<head>Chapter X.—Spiritual significance of the precepts of Moses respecting different
kinds of food.</head>
<p>Now, wherefore did Moses say, “Thou shalt not eat the swine, nor the eagle, nor the
hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of scales?”138 He embraced three
doctrines in his mind [in doing so]. Moreover, the Lord saith to them in Deuteronomy,
“And I will establish my ordinances among this people.”139 Is there then not a command
of God [that] they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual
reference.140 For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, “Thou shalt not join
thyself to men who resemble swine.” For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord;
but when they come to want, they acknowledge the Lord. And [in like manner] the swine,
when it has eaten, does not recognize its master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving
food is quiet again. “Neither shalt thou eat,” says he “the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the
kite, nor the raven.” “Thou shalt not join thyself,” he means, “to such men as know not how
to procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of others in their
iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others.”141
So these birds, while they sit idle, inquire how they may devour the flesh of others, proving
themselves pests [to all] by their wickedness. “And thou shalt not eat,” he says, “the lamprey,
or the polypus, or the cuttlefish.” He means, “Thou shalt not join thyself or be like to such
men as are ungodly to the end, and are condemned142 to death.” In like manner as those
fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but
make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom. Moreover, “Thou shall not,” he says,
“eat the hare.” Wherefore? “Thou shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such.”143
Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as many years as
it lives so many144 it has. Moreover, “Thou shall not eat the hyena.” He means, “Thou shall
not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such.” Wherefore? Because
that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female.
<note type="footnote">138 Cod. Sin. has “portion,” corrected, however, as above. See Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv.</note>

birds alone do not procure food for themselves (by labour), but sitting idle, seek to devour the flesh of others.”

<note type="footnote">143 Dressel has a note upon this passage, in which he refers the words we have rendered, “corrupters of boys,”

Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he means, “Thou shalt not be like to those
whom we hear of as committing wickedness with the mouth,145 on account of their uncleanness;
nor shall thou be joined to those impure women who commit iniquity with the mouth.
For this animal conceives by the mouth.” Moses then issued146 three doctrines concerning
meats with a spiritual significance; but they received them according to fleshly desire, as if
he had merely spoken of [literal] meats. David, however, comprehends the knowledge of
the three doctrines, and speaks in like manner: “Blessed is the man who hath not walked in
the counsel of the ungodly,”147 even as the fishes [referred to] go in darkness to the depths
[of the sea]; “and hath not stood in the way of sinners,” even as those who profess to fear
the Lord, but go astray like swine; “and hath not sat in the seat of scorners,”148 even as those
birds that lie in wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this spiritual149 knowledge. But
Moses says still further, “Ye shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant.”
What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes
Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him,150 is visibly made glad. Well spake
[Moses], having respect to the commandment. What, then, does he mean? That we ought
to join ourselves to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their heart on the commandment
which they have received, those who both utter the judgments of the Lord and
observe them, those who know that meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate151
upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also
walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state152 [to come]. Behold how well Moses
legislated. But how was it possible for them to understand or comprehend these things? We
then, rightly understanding his commandments,153 explain them as the Lord intended. For
this purpose He circumcised our ears and our hearts, that we might understand these things.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Baptism and the cross prefigured in the Old Testament.</head>
<p>Let us further inquire whether the Lord took any care to foreshadow the water [of baptism]
and the cross. Concerning the water, indeed, it is written, in reference to the Israelites,
that they should not receive that baptism which leads to the remission of sins, but should
procure154 another for themselves. The prophet therefore declares, “Be astonished, O
heaven, and let the earth tremble155 at this, because this people hath committed two great
evils: they have forsaken Me, a living fountain, and have hewn out for themselves broken
cisterns.156 Is my holy hill Zion a desolate rock? For ye shall be as the fledglings of a bird,
which fly away when the nest is removed.”157 And again saith the prophet, “I will go before
thee and make level the mountains, and will break the brazen gates, and bruise in pieces the
iron bars; and I will give thee the secret,158 hidden, invisible treasures, that they may know
that I am the Lord God.”159 And “He shall dwell in a lofty cave of the strong rock.”160 Furthermore,
what saith He in reference to the Son? “His water is sure;161 ye shall see the King
in His glory, and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the Lord.”162 And again He saith
in another prophet, “The man who doeth these things shall be like a tree planted by the
courses of waters, which shall yield its fruit in due season; and his leaf shall not fade, and
all that he doeth shall prosper. Not so are the ungodly, not so, but even as chaff, which the
wind sweeps away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just; for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
but the way of the ungodly shall perish.”163 Mark how He has described at once both
the water and the cross. For these words imply, Blessed are they who, placing their trust in
the cross, have gone down into the water; for, says He, they shall receive their reward in due
time: then He declares, I will recompense them. But now He saith,164 “Their leaves shall
not fade.” This meaneth, that every word which proceedeth out of your mouth in faith and
love shall tend to bring conversion and hope to many. Again, another prophet saith, “And
the land of Jacob shall be extolled above every land.”165 This meaneth the vessel of His

<head>Chapter XII.—The cross of Christ frequently announced in the Old Testament.</head>
<p>In like manner He points to the cross of Christ in another prophet, who saith,168 “And
when shall these things be accomplished? And the Lord saith, When a tree shall be bent
down, and again arise, and when blood shall flow out of wood.”169 Here again you have an
intimation concerning the cross, and Him who should be crucified. Yet again He speaks of
this170 in Moses, when Israel was attacked by strangers. And that He might remind them,
when assailed, that it was on account of their sins they were delivered to death, the Spirit
speaks to the heart of Moses, that he should make a figure of the cross,171 and of Him about
to suffer thereon; for unless they put their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever.
Moses therefore placed one weapon above another in the midst of the hill,172 and standing
upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched forth his hands,173 and thus again
Israel acquired the mastery. But when again he let down his hands, they were again destroyed.
For what reason? That they might know that they could not be saved unless they put their
trust in Him.174 And in another prophet He declares, “All day long I have stretched forth
My hands to an unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way.”175 And again
Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, [and also]
that He would be the author of life176 [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on
the cross177 when Israel was falling. For since transgression was committed by Eve through
means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them,
and they died,178 that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression they
were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, “Ye shall
not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,”179 did so that he might reveal a type

of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,180 and by proclamation
assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses
that he would offer sacrifice181 in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake
unto them, saying, “When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on
the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and
immediately he shall be restored.”182 And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication
of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.183 What, again, says Moses to
Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him184 this name, as being a prophet, with
this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning
His Son Jesus to the son185 of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him
to spy out the land, he said, “Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares,
that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.”186
Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,187 is not the Son of
man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son188 of
David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, “The Lord said unto my
Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”189 And again, thus
saith Isaiah, “The Lord said to Christ,190 my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,191 that
the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of
kings.”192 Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Christians, and not Jews, the heirs of the covenant.</head>
<p>But let us see if this people193 is the heir, or the former, and if the covenant belongs to
us or to them. Hear ye now what the Scripture saith concerning the people. Isaac prayed
for Rebecca his wife, because she was barren; and she conceived.194 Furthermore also, Rebecca
went forth to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord said to her, “Two nations are in thy
womb, and two peoples in thy belly; and the one people shall surpass the other, and the
elder shall serve the younger.”195 You ought to understand who was Isaac, who Rebecca,
and concerning what persons He declared that this people should be greater than that. And
in another prophecy Jacob speaks more clearly to his son Joseph, saying, “Behold, the Lord
hath not deprived me of thy presence; bring thy sons to me, that I may bless them.”196 And
he brought Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that Manasseh197 should be blessed, because
he was the elder. With this view Joseph led him to the right hand of his father Jacob. But
Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise afterwards. And what says [the Scripture]?
And Jacob changed the direction of his hands, and laid his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. And Joseph said to Jacob, “Transfer
thy right hand to the head of Manasseh,198 for he is my first-born son.”199 And Jacob said,
“I know it, my son, I know it; but the elder shall serve the younger: yet he also shall be
blessed.”200 Ye see on whom he laid201 [his hands], that this people should be first, and
heir of the covenant. If then, still further, the same thing was intimated through Abraham,
we reach the perfection of our knowledge. What, then, says He to Abraham? “Because thou
hast believed,202 it is imputed to thee for righteousness: behold, I have made thee the father
of those nations who believe in the Lord while in [a state of] uncircumcision.”203</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Lord hath given us the testament which Moses received and
broke.</head>
<p>Yes [it is even so]; but let us inquire if the Lord has really given that testament which
He swore to the fathers that He would give204 to the people. He did give it; but they were
not worthy to receive it, on account of their sins. For the prophet declares, “And Moses was
fasting forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai, that he might receive the testament of
the Lord for the people.”205 And he received from the Lord206 two tables, written in the
spirit by the finger of the hand of the Lord. And Moses having received them, carried them
down to give to the people. And the Lord said to Moses, “Moses, Moses, go down quickly;
for thy people hath sinned, whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt.”207 And Moses
understood that they had again208 made molten images; and he threw the tables out of his
hands, and the tables of the testament of the Lord were broken. Moses then received it, but
they proved themselves unworthy. Learn now how we have received it. Moses, as a servant,209
received it; but the Lord himself, having suffered in our behalf, hath given it to us, that we
should be the people of inheritance. But He was manifested, in order that they might be
perfected in their iniquities, and that we, being constituted heirs through Him,210 might
receive the testament of the Lord Jesus, who was prepared for this end, that by His personal
manifestation, redeeming our hearts (which were already wasted by death, and given over
to the iniquity of error) from darkness, He might by His word enter into a covenant with
us. For it is written how the Father, about to redeem211 us from darkness, commanded Him
to prepare212 a holy people for Himself. The prophet therefore declares, “I, the Lord Thy
God, have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thy hand, and will strengthen Thee;
and I have given Thee for a covenant to the people, for a light to the nations, to open the
eyes of the blind, and to bring forth from fetters them that are bound, and those that sit in
darkness out of the prison-house.”213 Ye perceive,214 then, whence we have been redeemed.

He hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the humble: He hath sent me to heal the
broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind;

<head>Chapter XV.—The false and the true Sabbath.</head>
<p>Further,217 also, it is written concerning the Sabbath in the Decalogue which [the Lord]
spoke, face to face, to Moses on Mount Sinai, “And sanctify ye the Sabbath of the Lord with
clean hands and a pure heart.”218 And He says in another place, “If my sons keep the Sabbath,
then will I cause my mercy to rest upon them.”219 The Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning
of the creation [thus]: “And God made in six days the works of His hands, and made an end
on the seventh day, and rested on it, and sanctified it.”220 Attend, my children, to the
meaning of this expression, “He finished in six days.” This implieth that the Lord will finish
all things in six thousand years, for a day is221 with Him a thousand years. And He Himself
testifieth,222 saying, “Behold, to-day223 will be as a thousand years.”224 Therefore, my children,
in six days, that is, in six thousand years, all things will be finished. “And He rested
on the seventh day.” This meaneth: when His Son, coming [again], shall destroy the time
of the wicked man,225 and judge the ungodly, and change the sun, and the moon,226 and
the stars, then shall He truly rest on the seventh day. Moreover, He says, “Thou shalt sanc-
tify it with pure hands and a pure heart.” If, therefore, any one can now sanctify the day
which God hath sanctified, except he is pure in heart in all things,227 we are deceived.228
Behold, therefore:229 certainly then one properly resting sanctifies it, when we ourselves,
having received the promise, wickedness no longer existing, and all things having been made
new by the Lord, shall be able to work righteousness.230 Then we shall be able to sanctify

<head>Chapter XVI.—The spiritual temple of God.</head>
<p>Moreover, I will also tell you concerning the temple, how the wretched [Jews], wandering
in error, trusted not in God Himself, but in the temple, as being the house of God. For almost
after the manner of the Gentiles they worshipped Him in the temple.235 But learn how the
Lord speaks, when abolishing it: “Who hath meted out heaven with a span, and the earth
with his palm? Have not I?”236 “Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is My throne, and the earth
My footstool: what kind of house will ye build to Me, or what is the place of My rest?”237
Ye perceive that their hope is vain. Moreover, He again says, “Behold, they who have cast
down this temple, even they shall build it up again.”238 It has so happened.239 For through
their going to war, it was destroyed by their enemies; and now they, as the servants of their
enemies, shall rebuild it. Again, it was revealed that the city and the temple and the people
of Israel were to be given up. For the Scripture saith, “And it shall come to pass in the last
days, that the Lord will deliver up the sheep of His pasture, and their sheep-fold and tower,
to destruction.”240 And it so happened as the Lord had spoken. Let us inquire, then, if there
still is a temple of God. There is—where He himself declared He would make and finish it.
For it is written, “And it shall come to pass, when the week is completed, the temple of God
shall be built in glory in the name of the Lord.”241 I find, therefore, that a temple does exist.
Learn, then, how it shall be built in the name of the Lord. Before we believed in God, the
habitation of our heart was corrupt and weak, as being indeed like a temple made with
hands. For it was full of idolatry, and was a habitation of demons, through our doing such
things as were opposed to [the will of] God. But it shall be built, observe ye, in the name of
the Lord, in order that the temple of the Lord may be built in glory. How? Learn [as follows].
Having received the forgiveness of sins, and placed our trust in the name of the Lord, we
have become new creatures, formed again from the beginning. Wherefore in our habitation
God truly dwells in us. How? His word of faith; His calling242 of promise; the wisdom of
the statutes; the commands of the doctrine; He himself prophesying in us; He himself
dwelling in us; opening to us who were enslaved by death the doors of the temple, that is,
the mouth; and by giving us repentance introduced us into the incorruptible temple.243 He

<p>The way of light, then, is as follows. If any one desires to travel to the appointed place,
he must be zealous in his works. The knowledge, therefore, which is given to us for the
purpose of walking in this way, is the following. Thou shalt love Him that created thee:250
thou shalt glorify Him that redeemed thee from death. Thou shalt be simple in heart, and
rich in spirit. Thou shalt not join thyself to those who walk in the way of death. Thou shalt
hate doing what is unpleasing to God: thou shalt hate all hypocrisy. Thou shalt not forsake
the commandments of the Lord. Thou shalt not exalt thyself, but shalt be of a lowly mind.251
Thou shalt not take glory to thyself. Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not allow over-boldness to enter into thy soul.252 Thou shalt not commit fornication:
thou shalt not commit adultery: thou shalt not be a corrupter of youth. Thou shalt
not let the word of God issue from thy lips with any kind of impurity.253 Thou shalt not
accept persons when thou reprovest any one for transgression. Thou shalt be meek: thou
shalt be peaceable. Thou shalt tremble at the words which thou hearest.254 Thou shalt not
be mindful of evil against thy brother. Thou shalt not be of doubtful mind255 as to whether
a thing shall be or not. Thou shalt not take the name256 of the Lord in vain. Thou shalt love
thy neighbour more than thine own soul.257 Thou shalt not slay the child by procuring
abortion; nor, again, shalt thou destroy it after it is born. Thou shalt not withdraw thy hand
from thy son, or from thy daughter, but from their infancy thou shalt teach them the fear
of the Lord.258 Thou shalt not covet what is thy neighbour’s, nor shalt thou be avaricious.
Thou shalt not be joined in soul with the haughty, but thou shalt be reckoned with the
righteous and lowly. Receive thou as good things the trials259 which come upon thee.260
Thou shalt not be of double mind or of double tongue,261 for a double tongue is a snare of
death. Thou shalt be subject262 to the Lord, and to [other] masters as the image of God,

thy man-servant, who trust in the same [God263], lest thou shouldst not264 reverence that
God who is above both; for He came to call men not according to their outward appearance,
265 but according as the Spirit had prepared them.266 Thou shalt communicate in all
things with thy neighbour; thou shalt not call267 things thine own; for if ye are partakers in
common of things which are incorruptible,268 how much more [should you be] of those
things which are corruptible!269 Thou shalt not be hasty with thy tongue, for the mouth is
a snare of death. As far as possible, thou shalt be pure in thy soul. Do not be ready to stretch
forth thy hands to take, whilst thou contractest them to give. Thou shalt love, as the apple
of thine eye, every one that speaketh to thee the word of the Lord. Thou shalt remember the
day of judgment, night and day. Thou shalt seek out every day the faces of the saints,270
either by word examining them, and going to exhort them, and meditating how to save a
soul by the word,271 or by thy hands thou shalt labour for the redemption of thy sins. Thou
shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest. “Give to every one that asketh
thee,”272 and thou shalt know who is the good Recompenser of the reward. Thou shalt
preserve what thou hast received [in charge], neither adding to it nor taking from it. To the
last thou shalt hate the wicked273 [one].274 Thou shalt judge righteously. Thou shalt not
make a schism, but thou shalt pacify those that contend by bringing them together. Thou
shalt confess thy sins. Thou shalt not go to prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way
of light.275</p>

judgments,284 with patience. And be ye285 taught of God, inquiring diligently what the Lord
asks from you; and do it that ye maybe safe in the day of judgment.286 And if you have any

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introductory Note to the Fragments of Papias</head>
<p>[a.d. 70–155.] It seems unjust to the holy man of whose comparatively large contributions
to early Christian literature such mere relics have been preserved, to set them forth in these
versions, unaccompanied by the copious annotations of Dr. Routh. If even such crumbs
from his table are not by any means without a practical value, with reference to the Canon
and other matters, we may well credit the testimony (though disputed) of Eusebius, that he
was a learned man, and well versed in the Holy Scripture.1 All who name poor Papias are
sure to do so with the apologetic qualification of that historian, that he was of slender capacity.
Nobody who attributes to him the millenarian fancies, of which he was but a narrator, as if
these were the characteristics rather than the blemishes of his works, can fail to accept this
estimate of our author. But more may be said when we come to the great name of Irenæus,
who seems to make himself responsible for them.2</p>
<p>Papias has the credit of association with Polycarp, in the friendship of St. John himself,
and of “others who had seen the Lord.” He is said to have been bishop of Hierapolis, in
Phrygia, and to have died about the same time that Polycarp suffered; but even this is
questioned. So little do we know of one whose lost books, could they be recovered, might
reverse the received judgment, and establish his claim to the disputed tribute which makes
him, like Apollos, “an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures.”</p>
<p>The following is the original Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>The principal information in regard to Papias is given in the extracts made among the
fragments from the works of Irenæus and Eusebius. He was bishop of the Church in
Hierapolis, a city of Phrygia, in the first half of the second century. Later writers affirm that
he suffered martyrdom about a.d. 163; some saying that Rome, others that Pergamus, was
the scene of his death. He was a hearer of the Apostle John, and was on terms of intimate
intercourse with many who had known the Lord and His apostles. From these he gathered
the floating traditions in regard to the sayings of our Lord, and wove them into a production
divided into five books. This work does not seem to have been confined to an exposition of
the sayings of Christ, but to have contained much historical information.</p>
<p>Eusebius3 speaks of Papias as a man most learned in all things, and well acquainted with
the Scriptures. In another passage4 he describes him as of small capacity. The fragments of
Papias are translated from the text given in Routh’s Reliquiæ Sacræ, vol. i.5</p>

<head>I. From the exposition of the oracles of the Lord.6</head>
<p>[The writings of Papias in common circulation are five in number, and these are called
an Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord. Irenæus makes mention of these as the only works
written by him, in the following words: “Now testimony is borne to these things in writing
by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John, and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth
of his books; for five books were composed by him.” Thus wrote Irenæus. Moreover, Papias
himself, in the introduction to his books, makes it manifest that he was not himself a hearer
and eye-witness of the holy apostles; but he tells us that he received the truths of our religion7
from those who were acquainted with them [the apostles] in the following words:]</p>
<p>But I shall not be unwilling to put down, along with my interpretations,8 whatsoever
instructions I received with care at any time from the elders, and stored up with care in my
memory, assuring you at the same time of their truth. For I did not, like the multitude, take
pleasure in those who spoke much, but in those who taught the truth; nor in those who related
strange commandments,9 but in those who rehearsed the commandments given by the Lord
to faith,10 and proceeding from truth itself. If, then, any one who had attended on the elders
came, I asked minutely after their sayings,—what Andrew or Peter said, or what was said
by Philip, or by Thomas, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the
Lord’s disciples: which things11 Aristion and the presbyter John, the disciples of the Lord,
say. For I imagined that what was to be got from books was not so profitable to me as what
came from the living and abiding voice.</p>
<note type="footnote">6 This fragment is found in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. iii. 39.</note>
<note type="footnote">7 Literally, “the things of faith.”</note>
<note type="footnote">8 Papias states that he will give an exact account of what the elders said; and that, in addition to this, he will
accompany this account with an explanation of the meaning and import of the statements.</note>
<note type="footnote">9 Literally, “commandments belonging to others,” and therefore strange and novel to the followers of Christ.</note>
<note type="footnote">10 Given to faith has been variously understood. Either not stated in direct language, but like parables given
in figures, so that only the faithful could understand; or entrusted to faith, that is, to those who were possessed
of faith, the faithful.</note>
<note type="footnote">11 Which things: this is usually translated, “what Aristion and John say;” and the translation is admissible.
But the words more naturally mean, that John and Aristion, even at the time of his writing, were telling him
some of the sayings of the Lord.</note>

<p>As the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord remembered that they had heard
from him how the Lord taught in regard to those times, and said]: “The days will come in
which vines shall grow, having each ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand
twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every one of the shoots ten thousand
clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed
will give five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of
a cluster, another shall cry out, ‘I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.’
In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that
every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear,
pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar proportions;
and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become
peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.”18 [Testimony is borne to
these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John and a friend of
Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by him. And he added,
saying, “Now these things are credible to believers. And Judas the traitor,” says he, “not believing,
and asking, ‘How shall such growths be accomplished by the Lord?’ the Lord said,
‘They shall see who shall come to them.’ These, then, are the times mentioned by the
prophet Isaiah: ‘And the wolf shall lie down with the lamb,’ etc. (Isa. xi. 6 ff.).”]</p>

<p>As the presbyters say, then20 those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall
go there, others shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and others shall possess the splendour
of the city;21 for everywhere the Saviour will be seen, according as they shall be worthy who
see Him. But that there is this distinction between the habitation of those who produce an
hundred-fold, and that of those who produce sixty-fold, and that of those who produce
thirty-fold; for the first will be taken up into the heavens, the second class will dwell in
Paradise, and the last will inhabit the city; and that on this account the Lord said, “In my
Father’s house are many mansions:”22 for all things belong to God, who supplies all with a
suitable dwelling-place, even as His word says, that a share is given to all by the Father,23
according as each one is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch24 in which they shall recline
who feast, being invited to the wedding. The presbyters, the disciples of the apostles, say
that this is the gradation and arrangement of those who are saved, and that they advance
through steps of this nature; and that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son,
and through the Son to the Father; and that in due time the Son will yield up His work to
the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, “For He must reign till He hath put all enemies
under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”25 For in the times of the
kingdom the just man who is on the earth shall forget to die. “But when He saith all things
are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him.
And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject
unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.”26</p>

<p>[Papias, who is now mentioned by us, affirms that he received the sayings of the apostles
from those who accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion
and the presbyter John.28 Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in his
writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances may not be without its
use. It may also be worth while to add to the statements of Papias already given, other passages
of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge
of them from tradition. The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis
has been mentioned above. We must now point out how Papias, who lived at the same time,
relates that he had received a wonderful narrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates
that a dead man was raised to life in his day.29 He also mentions another miracle relating
to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm,
on account of the grace of the Lord. The same person, moreover, has set down other things
as coming to him from unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and instructions
of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous nature.30 Amongst these
he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal
reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own
writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord’s sayings,
and the traditions of the presbyter John. For information on these points, we can merely
refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall
add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the
Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the presbyter said this.
Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered.
It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ.
For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied
Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but
with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord’s sayings. Wherefore Mark made
no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took
especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the
statements. [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew
<note type="footnote">27 From Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., iii. 39.</note>

<note type="footnote">29 “In his day” may mean “in the days of Papias,” or “in the days of Philip.” As the narrative came from the
daughters of Philip, it is more likely that Philip’s days are meant.</note>

he has made the following statements]: Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in
the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could. [The same person
uses proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from the Epistle of Peter in like manner. And
he also gives another story of a woman31 who was accused of many sins before the Lord,
which is to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.]</p>

<p>Papias thus speaks, word for word: To some of them [angels] He gave dominion over

And he says, immediately after this: but it happened that their arrangement came to nothing.33</p>

<head>Justin Martyr </head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="419"/>
<head>Introductory Note to the Writings of Justin Martyr</head>
<p>[a.d. 110–165.] Justin was a Gentile, but born in Samaria, near Jacob’s well. He must
have been well educated: he had travelled extensively, and he seems to have been a person
enjoying at least a competence. After trying all other systems, his elevated tastes and refined
perceptions made him a disciple of Socrates and Plato. So he climbed towards Christ. As
he himself narrates the story of his conversion, it need not be anticipated here. What Plato
was feeling after, he found in Jesus of Nazareth. The conversion of such a man marks a new
era in the gospel history. The sub-apostolic age begins with the first Christian author,—the
founder of theological literature. It introduced to mankind, as the mother of true philosophy,
the despised teaching of those Galileans to whom their Master had said, “Ye are the light of
the world.”</p>
<p>And this is the epoch which forced this great truth upon the attention of contemplative
minds. It was more than a hundred years since the angels had sung “Good-will to men;”
and that song had now been heard for successive generations, breaking forth from the lips
of sufferers on the cross, among lions, and amid blazing faggots. Here was a nobler Stoicism
that needed interpretation. Not only choice spirits, despising the herd and boasting of a
loftier intellectual sphere, were its professors; but thousands of men, women, and children,
withdrawing themselves not at all from the ordinary and humble lot of the people, were
inspired by it to live and die heroically and sublimely, —exhibiting a superiority to revenge
and hate entirely unaccountable, praying for their enemies, and seeking to glorify their God
by love to their fellow-men.</p>
<p>And in spite of Gallios and Neros alike, the gospel was dispelling the gross darkness.
Of this, Pliny’s letter to Trajan is decisive evidence. Even in Seneca we detect reflections of
the daybreak. Plutarch writes as never a Gentile could have written until now. Plato is
practically surpassed by him in his thoughts upon the “delays1 of the Divine Justice.” Hadrian’s
address to his soul, in his dying moments, is a tribute to the new ideas which had been
sown in the popular mind. And now the Antonines, impelled by something in the age, came
forward to reign as “philosophers.” At this moment, Justin Martyr confronts them like a
Daniel. The “little stone” smites the imperial image in the face, not yet “in the toes.” He tells
the professional philosophers on a throne how false and hollow is all wisdom that is not
meant for all humanity, and that is not capable of leavening the masses. He exposes the
impotency of even Socratic philosophy: he shows, in contrast, the force that works in the
<note type="footnote">1 See Amyot’s translation, and a more modern one by De Maistre (OEuvres, vol. ii. Paris, 1833). An edition
of The Delays (the original, with notes by Professor Hackett) has appeared in America (Andover, circ., 1842),
and is praised by Tayler Lewis.</note>

<pb n="420"/>
words of Jesus; he points out their regenerating power. It is the mission of Justin to be a star
in the West, leading its Wise Men to the cradle of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>The writings of Justin are deficient in charms of style; and, for us, there is something
the reverse of attractive in the forms of thought which he had learned from the philosophers.2
If Plato had left us nothing but the Timæus, a Renan would doubtless have reproached him
as of feeble intellectual power. So a dancing-master might criticise the movements of an
athlete, or the writhings of St. Sebastian shot with arrows. The practical wisdom of Justin
using the rhetoric of his times, and discomfiting false philosophy with its own weapons, is
not appreciated by the fastidious Parisian. But the manly and heroic pleadings of the man,
for a despised people with whom he had boldly identified himself; the intrepidity with which
he defends them before despots, whose mere caprice might punish him with death; above
all, the undaunted spirit with which he exposes the shame and absurdity of their inveterate
superstition and reproaches the memory of Hadrian whom Antoninus had deified, as he
had deified Antinous of loathsome history,—these are characteristics which every instinct
of the unvitiated soul delights to honour. Justin cannot be refuted by a sneer.</p>
<p>He wore his philosopher’s gown after his conversion, as a token that he had attained
the only true philosophy. And seeing, that, after the conflicts and tests of ages, it is the only
philosophy that lasts and lives and triumphs, its discoverer deserves the homage of mankind.
Of the philosophic gown we shall hear again when we come to Tertullian.3</p>
<p>The residue of Justin’s history may be found in The Martyrdom and other pages soon
to follow, as well as in the following Introductory Note of the able translators, Messrs. Dods
and Reith:—</p>
<p>Justin Martyr was born in Flavia Neapolis, a city of Samaria, the modern Nablous. The
date of his birth is uncertain, but may be fixed about a.d. 114. His father and grandfather
were probably of Roman origin. Before his conversion to Christianity he studied in the
schools of the philosophers, searching after some knowledge which should satisfy the cravings
of his soul. At last he became acquainted with Christianity, being at once impressed with
the extraordinary fearlessness which the Christians displayed in the presence of death, and
with the grandeur, stability, and truth of the teachings of the Old Testament. From this time
he acted as an evangelist, taking every opportunity to proclaim the gospel as the only safe
and certain philosophy, the only way to salvation. It is probable that he travelled much. We
know that he was some time in Ephesus, and he must have lived for a considerable period
in Rome. Probably he settled in Rome as a Christian teacher. While he was there, the
<note type="footnote">2 He quotes Plato’s reference, e.g., to the X.; but the Orientals delighted in such conceits. Compare the Hebrew
critics on the ה (in Gen. i. 4), on which see Nordheimer, Gram., vol. i. p. 7, New York, 1838.</note>

different forms.</note>

<pb n="421"/>
philosophers, especially the Cynics, plotted against him, and he sealed his testimony to the
truth by martyrdom.</p>
<p>The principal facts of Justin’s life are gathered from his own writings. There is little clue
to dates. It is agreed on all hands that he lived in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and the testimony
of Eusebius and most credible historians renders it nearly certain that he suffered
martyrdom in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The Chronicon Paschale gives as the date 165
a.d.</p>
<p>The writings of Justin Martyr are among the most important that have come down to
us from the second century. He was not the first that wrote an Apology in behalf of the
Christians, but his Apologies are the earliest extant. They are characterized by intense
Christian fervour, and they give us an insight into the relations existing between heathens
and Christians in those days. His other principal writing, the Dialogue with Trypho, is the
first elaborate exposition of the reasons for regarding Christ as the Messiah of the Old
Testament, and the first systematic attempt to exhibit the false position of the Jews in regard
to Christianity.</p>
<p>Many of Justin’s writings have perished. Those works which have come to us bearing
his name have been divided into three classes.</p>
<p>The first class embraces those which are unquestionably genuine, viz. the two Apologies,
and the Dialogue with Trypho. Some critics have urged objections against Justin’s authorship
of the Dialogue; but the objections are regarded now as possessing no weight.</p>
<p>The second class consists of those works which are regarded by some critics as Justin’s,
and by others as not his. They are: 1. An Address to the Greeks; 2. A Hortatory Address to
the Greeks; 3. On the Sole Government of God; 4. An Epistle to Diognetus; 5. Fragments
from a work on the Resurrection; 6. And other Fragments. Whatever difficulty there may
be in settling the authorship of these treatises, there is but one opinion as to their earliness.
The latest of them, in all probability, was not written later than the third century.</p>
<p>The third class consists of those that are unquestionably not the works of Justin. These
are: 1. An Exposition of the True Faith; 2. Replies to the Orthodox; 3. Christian Questions
to Gentiles; 4. Gentile Questions to Christians; 5. Epistle to Zenas and Serenus; and 6. A
Refutation of certain Doctrines of Aristotle. There is no clue to the date of the two last. There
can be no doubt that the others were written after the Council of Nicæa, though, immediately
after the Reformation, Calvin and others appealed to the first as a genuine writing of Justin’s.</p>
<p>There is a curious question connected with the Apologies of Justin which have come
down to us. Eusebius mentions two Apologies,—one written in the reign of Antoninus Pius,
the other in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Critics have disputed much whether we have
these two Apologies in those now extant. Some have maintained, that what is now called
the Second Apology was the preface of the first, and that the second is lost. Others have
tried to show, that the so-called Second Apology is the continuation of the first, and that

<pb n="422"/>
the second is lost. Others have supposed that the two Apologies which we have are Justin’s
two Apologies, but that Eusebius was wrong in affirming that the second was addressed to
Marcus Aurelius; and others maintain, that we have in our two Apologies the two Apologies
mentioned by Eusebius, and that our first is his first, and our second his second.</p>

<p>Reason directs those who are truly pious and philosophical to honour and love only

does sound reason direct us to refuse the guidance of those who did or taught anything
wrong, but it is incumbent on the lover of truth, by all means, and if death be threatened,
even before his own life, to choose to do and say what is right. Do you, then, since ye are

and hearken to my address; and if ye are indeed such, it will be manifested. For we have

<head>Chapter III.—Claim of judicial investigation.</head>
<p>But lest any one think that this is an unreasonable and reckless utterance, we demand
that the charges against the Christians be investigated, and that, if these be substantiated,
they be punished as they deserve; [or rather, indeed, we ourselves will punish them.]5 But
if no one can convict us of anything, true reason forbids you, for the sake of a wicked rumour,
to wrong blameless men, and indeed rather yourselves, who think fit to direct affairs, not
by judgment, but by passion. And every sober-minded person will declare this to be the
only fair and equitable adjustment, namely, that the subjects render an unexceptional account
of their own life and doctrine; and that, on the other hand, the rulers should give their decision
in obedience, not to violence and tyranny, but to piety and philosophy. For thus
would both rulers and ruled reap benefit. For even one of the ancients somewhere said,
“Unless both rulers and ruled philosophize, it is impossible to make states blessed.”6 It is
our task, therefore, to afford to all an opportunity of inspecting our life and teachings, lest,
on account of those who are accustomed to be ignorant of our affairs, we should incur the
penalty due to them for mental blindness;7 and it is your business, when you hear us, to be
found, as reason demands, good judges. For if, when ye have learned the truth, you do not
what is just, you will be before God without excuse.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Christians unjustly condemned for their mere name.</head>
<p>By the mere application of a name, nothing is decided, either good or evil, apart from
the actions implied in the name; and indeed, so far at least as one may judge from the name
we are accused of, we are most excellent people.8 But as we do not think it just to beg to be
acquitted on account of the name, if we be convicted as evil-doers, so, on the other hand, if
we be found to have committed no offence, either in the matter of thus naming ourselves,
or of our conduct as citizens, it is your part very earnestly to guard against incurring just
punishment, by unjustly punishing those who are not convicted. For from a name neither
praise nor punishment could reasonably spring, unless something excellent or base in action
be proved. And those among yourselves who are accused you do not punish before they are
convicted; but in our case you receive the name as proof against us, and this although, so
far as the name goes, you ought rather to punish our accusers. For we are accused of being
Christians, and to hate what is excellent (Chrestian) is unjust. Again, if any of the accused
deny the name, and say that he is not a Christian, you acquit him, as having no evidence
against him as a wrong-doer; but if any one acknowledge that he is a Christian, you punish
him on account of this acknowledgment. Justice requires that you inquire into the life both
of him who confesses and of him who denies, that by his deeds it may be apparent what
kind of man each is. For as some who have been taught by the Master, Christ, not to deny
Him, give encouragement to others when they are put to the question, so in all probability
do those who lead wicked lives give occasion to those who, without consideration, take upon
them to accuse all the Christians of impiety and wickedness. And this also is not right. For
of philosophy, too, some assume the name and the garb who do nothing worthy of their
profession; and you are well aware, that those of the ancients whose opinions and teachings
were quite diverse, are yet all called by the one name of philosophers. And of these some
taught atheism; and the poets who have flourished among you raise a laugh out of the uncleanness
of Jupiter with his own children. And those who now adopt such instruction are
not restrained by you; but, on the contrary, you bestow prizes and honours upon those who
euphoniously insult the gods.</p>
<note type="footnote">8 Justin avails himself here of the similarity in sound of the words Χριστὸς (Christ) and χρηστὸς (good, worthy,
excellent). The play upon these words is kept up throughout this paragraph, and cannot be always represented
to the English reader. [But Justin was merely quoting and using, ad hominem, the popular blunder of which
Suetonius (Life of Claudius, cap. 25) gives us an example, “impulsore Chresto.” It will be observed again in others

<head>Chapter V.—Christians charged with atheism.</head>
<p>Why, then, should this be? In our case, who pledge ourselves to do no wickedness, nor
to hold these atheistic opinions, you do not examine the charges made against us; but,
yielding to unreasoning passion, and to the instigation of evil demons, you punish us without
consideration or judgment. For the truth shall be spoken; since of old these evil demons,
effecting apparitions of themselves, both defiled women and corrupted boys, and showed
such fearful sights to men, that those who did not use their reason in judging of the actions
that were done, were struck with terror; and being carried away by fear, and not knowing
that these were demons, they called them gods, and gave to each the name which each of
the demons chose for himself.9 And when Socrates endeavoured, by true reason and examination,
to bring these things to light, and deliver men from the demons, then the demons
themselves, by means of men who rejoiced in iniquity, compassed his death, as an atheist
and a profane person, on the charge that “he was introducing new divinities;” and in our
case they display a similar activity. For not only among the Greeks did reason (Logos) prevail
to condemn these things through Socrates, but also among the Barbarians were they condemned
by Reason (or the Word, the Logos) Himself, who took shape, and became man,
and was called Jesus Christ; and in obedience to Him, we not only deny that they who did
such things as these are gods,10 but assert that they are wicked and impious demons,11
whose actions will not bear comparison with those even of men desirous of virtue.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Charge of atheism refuted.</head>
<p>Hence are we called atheists. And we confess that we are atheists, so far as gods of this
sort are concerned, but not with respect to the most true God, the Father of righteousness
and temperance and the other virtues, who is free from all impurity. But both Him, and the
Son (who came forth from Him and taught us these things, and the host of the other good
angels who follow and are made like to Him),12 and the prophetic Spirit, we worship and
adore, knowing them in reason and truth, and declaring without grudging to every one who
wishes to learn, as we have been taught.</p>
<note type="footnote">12 This is the literal and obvious translation of Justin’s words. But from c. 13, 16, and 61, it is evident that he
did not desire to inculcate the worship of angels. We are therefore driven to adopt another translation of this
passage, even though it be somewhat harsh. Two such translations have been proposed: the first connecting
“us” and “the host of the other good angels” as the common object of the verb “taught;” the second connecting
“these things” with “the host of,” etc., and making these two together the subject taught. In the first case the
translation would stand, “taught these things to us and to the host,” etc.; in the second case the translation would
be, “taught us about these things, and about the host of the others who follow Him, viz. the good angels.” [I have
ventured to insert parenthetic marks in the text, an obvious and simple resource to suggest the manifest intent
of the author. Grabe’s note in loc. gives another and very ingenious exegesis, but the simplest is best.]</note>

For you condemn many, many a time, after inquiring into the life of each of the accused
severally, but not on account of those of whom we have been speaking.13 And this we acknowledge,
that as among the Greeks those who teach such theories as please themselves
are all called by the one name “Philosopher,” though their doctrines be diverse, so also
among the Barbarians this name on which accusations are accumulated is the common
property of those who are and those who seem wise. For all are called Christians. Wherefore
we demand that the deeds of all those who are accused to you be judged, in order that each
one who is convicted may be punished as an evil-doer, and not as a Christian; and if it is
clear that any one is blameless, that he may be acquitted, since by the mere fact of his being
a Christian he does no wrong.14 For we will not require that you punish our accusers;15
they being sufficiently punished by their present wickedness and ignorance of what is right.</p>

telling a lie. For, impelled by the desire of the eternal and pure life, we seek the abode that
is with God, the Father and Creator of all, and hasten to confess our faith, persuaded and
convinced as we are that they who have proved to God16 by their works that they followed
Him, and loved to abide with Him where there is no sin to cause disturbance, can obtain
these things. This, then, to speak shortly, is what we expect and have learned from Christ,
and teach. And Plato, in like manner, used to say that Rhadamanthus and Minos would
punish the wicked who came before them; and we say that the same thing will be done, but
at the hand of Christ, and upon the wicked in the same bodies united again to their spirits
which are now to undergo everlasting punishment; and not only, as Plato said, for a period
of a thousand years. And if any one say that this is incredible or impossible, this error of
ours is one which concerns ourselves only, and no other person, so long as you cannot
convict us of doing any harm.</p>

some say that they imitate to His honour), but have the names and forms of those wicked
demons which have appeared. For why need we tell you who already know, into what forms
the craftsmen,17 carving and cutting, casting and hammering, fashion the materials? And
often out of vessels of dishonour, by merely changing the form, and making an image of
the requisite shape, they make what they call a god; which we consider not only senseless,
but to be even insulting to God, who, having ineffable glory and form, thus gets His name
attached to things that are corruptible, and require constant service. And that the artificers
of these are both intemperate, and, not to enter into particulars, are practised in every vice,
you very well know; even their own girls who work along with them they corrupt. What
infatuation! that dissolute men should be said to fashion and make gods for your worship,
and that you should appoint such men the guardians of the temples where they are enshrined;
not recognising that it is unlawful even to think or say that men are the guardians of gods.</p>

<p>But we have received by tradition that God does not need the material offerings which
men can give, seeing, indeed, that He Himself is the provider of all things. And we have
been taught, and are convinced, and do believe, that He accepts those only who imitate the
excellences which reside in Him, temperance, and justice, and philanthropy, and as many
virtues as are peculiar to a God who is called by no proper name. And we have been taught
that He in the beginning did of His goodness, for man’s sake, create all things out of unformed
matter; and if men by their works show themselves worthy of this His design, they are
deemed worthy, and so we have received—of reigning in company with Him, being delivered
from corruption and suffering. For as in the beginning He created us when we were not, so
do we consider that, in like manner, those who choose what is pleasing to Him are, on account
of their choice, deemed worthy of incorruption and of fellowship with Him. For the coming
into being at first was not in our own power; and in order that we may follow those things
which please Him, choosing them by means of the rational faculties He has Himself endowed
us with, He both persuades us and leads us to faith. And we think it for the advantage of all
men that they are not restrained from learning these things, but are even urged thereto.
For the restraint which human laws could not effect, the Word, inasmuch as He is divine,
would have effected, had not the wicked demons, taking as their ally the lust of wickedness
which is in every man, and which draws variously to all manner of vice, scattered many false

Christians, though they know that death is the punishment awarded to him who so confesses.
For if we looked for a human kingdom, we should also deny our Christ, that we might not
be slain; and we should strive to escape detection, that we might obtain what we expect. But
since our thoughts are not fixed on the present, we are not concerned when men cut us off;

<head>Chapter XII.—Christians live as under God’s eye.</head>
<p>And more than all other men are we your helpers and allies in promoting peace, seeing
that we hold this view, that it is alike impossible for the wicked, the covetous, the conspirator,
and for the virtuous, to escape the notice of God, and that each man goes to everlasting
punishment or salvation according to the value of his actions. For if all men knew this, no
one would choose wickedness even for a little, knowing that he goes to the everlasting
punishment of fire; but would by all means restrain himself, and adorn himself with virtue,
that he might obtain the good gifts of God, and escape the punishments. For those who, on
account of the laws and punishments you impose, endeavour to escape detection when they
offend (and they offend, too, under the impression that it is quite possible to escape your
detection, since you are but men), those persons, if they learned and were convinced that
nothing, whether actually done or only intended, can escape the knowledge of God, would
by all means live decently on account of the penalties threatened, as even you yourselves
will admit. But you seem to fear lest all men become righteous, and you no longer have any
to punish. Such would be the concern of public executioners, but not of good princes. But,
as we before said, we are persuaded that these things are prompted by evil spirits, who demand
sacrifices and service even from those who live unreasonably; but as for you, we presume
that you who aim at [a reputation for] piety and philosophy will do nothing unreasonable.
But if you also, like the foolish, prefer custom to truth, do what you have power to
do. But just so much power have rulers who esteem opinion more than truth, as robbers
have in a desert. And that you will not succeed is declared by the Word, than whom, after
God who begat Him, we know there is no ruler more kingly and just. For as all shrink from
succeeding to the poverty or sufferings or obscurity of their fathers, so whatever the Word
forbids us to choose, the sensible man will not choose. That all these things should come to
pass, I say, our Teacher foretold, He who is both Son and Apostle of God the Father of all
and the Ruler, Jesus Christ; from whom also we have the name of Christians. Whence we
become more assured of all the things He taught us, since whatever He beforehand foretold
should come to pass, is seen in fact coming to pass; and this is the work of God, to tell of a
thing before it happens, and as it was foretold so to show it happening. It were possible to
pause here and add no more, reckoning that we demand what is just and true; but because
we are well aware that it is not easy suddenly to change a mind possessed by ignorance, we
intend to add a few things, for the sake of persuading those who love the truth, knowing
that it is not impossible to put ignorance to flight by presenting the truth.</p>

of our power by the exercise of prayer and thanksgiving for all things wherewith we are
supplied, as we have been taught that the only honour that is worthy of Him is not to consume
by fire what He has brought into being for our sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and
those who need, and with gratitude to Him to offer thanks by invocations and hymns18 for
our creation, and for all the means of health, and for the various qualities of the different
kinds of things, and for the changes of the seasons; and to present before Him petitions for
our existing again in incorruption through faith in Him. Our teacher of these things is Jesus
Christ, who also was born for this purpose, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, procurator
of Judæa, in the times of Tiberius Cæsar; and that we reasonably worship Him, having
learned that He is the Son of the true God Himself, and holding Him in the second place,
and the prophetic Spirit in the third, we will prove. For they proclaim our madness to consist
in this, that we give to a crucified man a place second to the unchangeable and eternal God,

<p>For we forewarn you to be on your guard, lest those demons whom we have been accusing
should deceive you, and quite divert you from reading and understanding what we say.
For they strive to hold you their slaves and servants; and sometimes by appearances in
dreams, and sometimes by magical impositions, they subdue all who make no strong opposing
effort for their own salvation. And thus do we also, since our persuasion by the Word,
stand aloof from them (i.e., the demons), and follow the only unbegotten God through His
Son —we who formerly delighted in fornication, but now embrace chastity alone; we who
formerly used magical arts, dedicate ourselves to the good and unbegotten God; we who
valued above all things the acquisition of wealth and possessions, now bring what we have
into a common stock, and communicate to every one in need; we who hated and destroyed
one another, and on account of their different manners would not live19 with men of a different
tribe, now, since the coming of Christ, live familiarly with them, and pray for our
enemies, and endeavour to persuade those who hate us unjustly to live conformably to the
good precepts of Christ, to the end that they may become partakers with us of the same
joyful hope of a reward from God the ruler of all. But lest we should seem to be reasoning
sophistically, we consider it right, before giving you the promised20 explanation, to cite a
few precepts given by Christ Himself. And be it yours, as powerful rulers, to inquire
whether we have been taught and do teach these things truly. Brief and concise utterances
fell from Him, for He was no sophist, but His word was the power of God.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—What Christ himself taught.</head>
<p>Concerning chastity, He uttered such sentiments as these:21 “Whosoever looketh upon
a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart before
God.” And, “If thy right eye offend thee, cut it out; for it is better for thee to enter into the
kingdom of heaven with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into everlasting fire.”
And, “Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced from another husband, committeth
adultery.”22 And, “There are some who have been made eunuchs of men, and some who
were born eunuchs, and some who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
heaven’s sake; but all cannot receive this saying.”23 So that all who, by human law, are twice
married,24 are in the eye of our Master sinners, and those who look upon a woman to lust
after her. For not only he who in act commits adultery is rejected by Him, but also he who
desires to commit adultery: since not only our works, but also our thoughts, are open before
God. And many, both men and women, who have been Christ’s disciples from childhood,
remain pure at the age of sixty or seventy years; and I boast that I could produce such from
every race of men. For what shall I say, too, of the countless multitude of those who have
reformed intemperate habits, and learned these things? For Christ called not the just nor
the chaste to repentance, but the ungodly, and the licentious, and the unjust; His words
being, “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”25 For the heavenly
Father desires rather the repentance than the punishment of the sinner. And of our love to
all, He taught thus: “If ye love them that love you, what new thing do ye? for even fornicators
do this. But I say unto you, Pray for your enemies, and love them that hate you, and bless
them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.”26 And that we should
communicate to the needy, and do nothing for glory, He said, “Give to him that asketh, and
from him that would borrow turn not away; for if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive,
what new thing do ye? even the publicans do this. Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where robbers break through; but lay up for
yourselves treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt. For what is a man

<head>Chapter XVI.—Concerning patience and swearing.</head>
<p>And concerning our being patient of injuries, and ready to serve all, and free from anger,
this is what He said: “To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and
him that taketh away thy cloak or coat, forbid not. And whosoever shall be angry, is in
danger of the fire. And every one that compelleth thee to go with him a mile, follow him
two. And let your good works shine before men, that they, seeing them, may glorify your
Father which is in heaven.”30 For we ought not to strive; neither has He desired us to be
imitators of wicked men, but He has exhorted us to lead all men, by patience and gentleness,
from shame and the love of evil. And this indeed is proved in the case of many who once
were of your way of thinking, but have changed their violent and tyrannical disposition,
being overcome either by the constancy which they have witnessed in their neighbours’
lives,31 or by the extraordinary forbearance they have observed in their fellow-travellers
when defrauded, or by the honesty of those with whom they have transacted business.</p>
<p>And with regard to our not swearing at all, and always speaking the truth, He enjoined
as follows: “Swear not at all; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.”32 And that we ought to worship God alone, He thus persuaded
us: “The greatest commandment is, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him
only shall thou serve, with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, the Lord God that made
thee.”33 And when a certain man came to Him and said, “Good Master,” He answered and
said, “There is none good but God only, who made all things.”34 And let those who are not
found living as He taught, be understood to be no Christians, even though they profess with
the lip the precepts of Christ; for not those who make profession, but those who do the
works, shall be saved, according to His word: “Not every one who saith to Me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in
heaven. For whosoever heareth Me, and doeth My sayings, heareth Him that sent Me. And
many will say unto Me, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk in Thy name, and done

He answered them, “Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the

<p>For reflect upon the end of each of the preceding kings, how they died the death common
to all, which, if it issued in insensibility, would be a godsend39 to all the wicked. But since
sensation remains to all who have ever lived, and eternal punishment is laid up (i.e., for the
wicked), see that ye neglect not to be convinced, and to hold as your belief, that these things
are true. For let even necromancy, and the divinations you practise by immaculate children,40
and the evoking of departed human souls,41 and those who are called among the magi,
Dream-senders and Assistant-spirits (Familiars),42 and all that is done by those who are
skilled in such matters —let these persuade you that even after death souls are in a state of
sensation; and those who are seized and cast about by the spirits of the dead, whom all call
dæmoniacs or madmen;43 and what you repute as oracles, both of Amphilochus, Dodana,
Pytho, and as many other such as exist; and the opinions of your authors, Empedocles and
Pythagoras, Plato and Socrates, and the pit of Homer,44 and the descent of Ulysses to inspect
these things, and all that has been uttered of a like kind. Such favour as you grant to these,
grant also to us, who not less but more firmly than they believe in God; since we expect to
receive again our own bodies, though they be dead and cast into the earth, for we maintain
that with God nothing is impossible.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The resurrection possible.</head>
<p>And to any thoughtful person would anything appear more incredible, than, if we were
not in the body, and some one were to say that it was possible that from a small drop of
human seed bones and sinews and flesh be formed into a shape such as we see? For let this
now be said hypothetically: if you yourselves were not such as you now are, and born of
such parents [and causes], and one were to show you human seed and a picture of a man,
and were to say with confidence that from such a substance such a being could be produced,
would you believe before you saw the actual production? No one will dare to deny [that
such a statement would surpass belief]. In the same way, then, you are now incredulous
because you have never seen a dead man rise again. But as at first you would not have believed
it possible that such persons could be produced from the small drop, and yet now you see
them thus produced, so also judge ye that it is not impossible that the bodies of men, after
they have been dissolved, and like seeds resolved into earth, should in God’s appointed time
rise again and put on incorruption. For what power worthy of God those imagine who say,
that each thing returns to that from which it was produced, and that beyond this not even
God Himself can do anything, we are unable to conceive; but this we see clearly, that they
would not have believed it possible that they could have become such and produced from
such materials, as they now see both themselves and the whole world to be. And that it is
better to believe even what is impossible to our own nature and to men, than to be unbelieving
like the rest of the world, we have learned; for we know that our Master Jesus Christ said,
that “what is impossible with men is possible with God,”45 and, “Fear not them that kill you,
and after that can do no more; but fear Him who after death is able to cast both soul and
body into hell.”46 And hell is a place where those are to be punished who have lived wickedly,
and who do not believe that those things which God has taught us by Christ will come to
pass.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Heathen analogies to Christian doctrine.</head>
<p>And the Sibyl47 and Hystaspes said that there should be a dissolution by God of things
corruptible. And the philosophers called Stoics teach that even God Himself shall be resolved
into fire, and they say that the world is to be formed anew by this revolution; but we understand
that God, the Creator of all things, is superior to the things that are to be changed. If,
therefore, on some points we teach the same things as the poets and philosophers whom
you honour, and on other points are fuller and more divine in our teaching, and if we alone
afford proof of what we assert, why are we unjustly hated more than all others? For while
we say that all things have been produced and arranged into a world by God, we shall seem
to utter the doctrine of Plato; and while we say that there will be a burning up of all, we
shall seem to utter the doctrine of the Stoics: and while we affirm that the souls of the wicked,
being endowed with sensation even after death, are punished, and that those of the good
being delivered from punishment spend a blessed existence, we shall seem to say the same
things as the poets and philosophers; and while we maintain that men ought not to worship
the works of their hands, we say the very things which have been said by the comic poet
Menander, and other similar writers, for they have declared that the workman is greater
than the work.</p>

<p>And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth48 of God, was produced
without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified and died, and
rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe
regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. For you know how many sons your esteemed
writers ascribed to Jupiter: Mercury, the interpreting word and teacher of all; Æsculapius,
who, though he was a great physician, was struck by a thunderbolt, and so ascended
to heaven; and Bacchus too, after he had been torn limb from limb; and Hercules, when he
had committed himself to the flames to escape his toils; and the sons of Leda, and Dioscuri;
and Perseus, son of Danae; and Bellerophon, who, though sprung from mortals, rose to
heaven on the horse Pegasus. For what shall I say of Ariadne, and those who, like her, have
been declared to be set among the stars? And what of the emperors who die among yourselves,
whom you deem worthy of deification, and in whose behalf you produce some one who
swears he has seen the burning Cæsar rise to heaven from the funeral pyre? And what kind
of deeds are recorded of each of these reputed sons of Jupiter, it is needless to tell to those
who already know. This only shall be said, that they are written for the advantage and encouragement49
of youthful scholars; for all reckon it an honourable thing to imitate the
gods. But far be such a thought concerning the gods from every well-conditioned soul, as
to believe that Jupiter himself, the governor and creator of all things, was both a parricide
and the son of a parricide, and that being overcome by the love of base and shameful
pleasures, he came in to Ganymede and those many women whom he had violated and that
his sons did like actions. But, as we said above, wicked devils perpetrated these things. And
we have learned that those only are deified who have lived near to God in holiness and virtue;
and we believe that those who live wickedly and do not repent are punished in everlasting
fire.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Son of God called Jesus, even if only a man by ordinary generation, yet,

Father of men and gods. And if we assert that the Word of God was born of God in a peculiar
manner, different from ordinary generation, let this, as said above, be no extraordinary
thing to you, who say that Mercury is the angelic word of God. But if any one objects that
He was crucified, in this also He is on a par with those reputed sons of Jupiter of yours, who
suffered as we have now enumerated. For their sufferings at death are recorded to have been
not all alike, but diverse; so that not even by the peculiarity of His sufferings does He seem
to be inferior to them; but, on the contrary, as we promised in the preceding part of this
discourse, we will now prove Him superior— or rather have already proved Him to be
so—for the superior is revealed by His actions. And if we even affirm that He was born of
a virgin, accept this in common with what you accept of Perseus. And in that we say that
He made whole the lame, the paralytic, and those born blind, we seem to say what is very

<p>And that this may now become evident to you—(firstly50) that whatever we assert in
conformity with what has been taught us by Christ, and by the prophets who preceded Him,
are alone true, and are older than all the writers who have existed; that we claim to be acknowledged,
not because we say the same things as these writers said, but because we say
true things: and (secondly) that Jesus Christ is the only proper Son who has been begotten
by God, being His Word and first-begotten, and power; and, becoming man according to
His will, He taught us these things for the conversion and restoration of the human race:
and (thirdly) that before He became a man among men, some, influenced by the demons
before mentioned, related beforehand, through the instrumentality of the poets, those circumstances
as having really happened, which, having fictitiously devised, they narrated, in
the same manner as they have caused to be fabricated the scandalous reports against us of
infamous and impious actions,51 of which there is neither witness nor proof—we shall bring
forward the following proof.</p>
<note type="footnote">50 The Benedictine editor, Maranus, Otto, and Trollope, here note that Justin in this chapter promises to
make good three distinct positions: 1st, That Christian doctrines alone are true, and are to be received, not on
account of their resemblance to the sentiments of poets and philosophers, but on their own account; 2d, that
Jesus Christ is the incarnate Son of God, and our teacher; 3d, that before His incarnation, the demons, having
some knowledge of what He would accomplish, enabled the heathen poets and priestis in some points to anticipate,
though in a distorted form, the facts of the incarnation. The first he establishes in chap. xxiv-xxix.; the
second in chap. xxx.-liii.; and the third in chap. liv. et sq.</note>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Varieties of heathen worship.</head>
<p>In the first place [we furnish proof], because, though we say things similar to what the
Greeks say, we only are hated on account of the name of Christ, and though we do no wrong,
are put to death as sinners; other men in other places worshipping trees and rivers, and mice
and cats and crocodiles, and many irrational animals. Nor are the same animals esteemed
by all; but in one place one is worshipped, and another in another, so that all are profane in
the judgment of one another, on account of their not worshipping the same objects. And
this is the sole accusation you bring against us, that we do not reverence the same gods as
you do, nor offer to the dead libations and the savour of fat, and crowns for their statues,52
and sacrifices. For you very well know that the same animals are with some esteemed gods,
with others wild beasts, and with others sacrificial victims.</p>

<p>And, secondly, because we—who, out of every race of men, used to worship Bacchus

as it is shameful even to mention), and Proserpine and Venus (who were maddened with
love of Adonis, and whose mysteries also you celebrate), or Æsculapius, or some one or
other of those who are called gods—have now, through Jesus Christ, learned to despise
these, though we be threatened with death for it, and have dedicated ourselves to the unbegotten
and impossible God; of whom we are persuaded that never was he goaded by lust of
Antiope, or such other women, or of Ganymede, nor was rescued by that hundred-handed
giant whose aid was obtained through Thetis, nor was anxious on this account53 that her
son Achilles should destroy many of the Greeks because of his concubine Briseis. Those

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Magicians not trusted by Christians.</head>
<p>And, thirdly, because after Christ’s ascension into heaven the devils put forward certain
men who said that they themselves were gods; and they were not only not persecuted by
you, but even deemed worthy of honours. There was a Samaritan, Simon, a native of the
village called Gitto, who in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and in your royal city of Rome, did
mighty acts of magic, by virtue of the art of the devils operating in him. He was considered
a god, and as a god was honoured by you with a statue, which statue was erected on the river
Tiber, between the two bridges, and bore this inscription, in the language of Rome:—“Simoni
Deo Sancto,”54 “To Simon the holy God.” And almost all the Samaritans, and a few even of
other nations, worship him, and acknowledge him as the first god; and a woman, Helena,
who went about with him at that time, and had formerly been a prostitute, they say is the
first idea generated by him. And a man, Menander, also a Samaritan, of the town Capparetæa,
a disciple of Simon, and inspired by devils, we know to have deceived many while he was
in Antioch by his magical art. He persuaded those who adhered to him that they should
never die, and even now there are some living who hold this opinion of his. And there is
Marcion, a man of Pontus, who is even at this day alive, and teaching his disciples to believe
in some other god greater than the Creator. And he, by the aid of the devils, has caused
many of every nation to speak blasphemies, and to deny that God is the maker of this universe,
and to assert that some other being, greater than He, has done greater works. All who
take their opinions from these men, are, as we before said,55 called Christians; just as also
those who do not agree with the philosophers in their doctrines, have yet in common with
them the name of philosophers given to them. And whether they perpetrate those fabulous
and shameful deeds56—the upsetting of the lamp, and promiscuous intercourse, and eating
human flesh—we know not; but we do know that they are neither persecuted nor put to
death by you, at least on account of their opinions. But I have a treatise against all the heresies
that have existed already composed, which, if you wish to read it, I will give you.</p>
<note type="footnote">54 It is very generally supposed that Justin was mistaken in understanding this to have been a statue erected
to Simon Magus. This supposition rests on the fact that in the year 1574, there was dug up in the island of the
Tiber a fragment of marble, with the inscription “Semoni Sanco Deo,” etc., being probably the base of a statue
erected to the Sabine deity Semo Sancus. This inscription Justin is supposed to have mistaken for the one he
gives above. This has always seemed to us very slight evidence on which to reject so precise a statement as Justin
here makes; a statement which he would scarcely have hazarded in an apology addressed to Rome, where every
person had the means of ascertaining its accuracy. If, as is supposed, he made a mis ake, it must have been at
once exposed, and other writers would not have so frequently repeated the story as they have done. See Burton’s

<p>But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of
wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we
should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls,
but also the males) are brought up to prostitution. And as the ancients are said to have
reared herds of oxen, or goats, or sheep, or grazing horses, so now we see you rear children
only for this shameful use; and for this pollution a multitude of females and hermaphrodites,
and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found in every nation. And you receive
the hire of these, and duty and taxes from them, whom you ought to exterminate from your
realm. And any one who uses such persons, besides the godless and infamous and impure
intercourse, may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother.
And there are some who prostitute even their own children and wives, and some are openly
mutilated for the purpose of sodomy; and they refer these mysteries to the mother of the
gods, and along with each of those whom you esteem gods there is painted a serpent,57 a
great symbol and mystery. Indeed, the things58 which you do openly and with applause, as
if the divine light were overturned and extinguished, these you lay to our charge; which, in
truth, does no harm to us who shrink from doing any such things, but only to those who
do them and bear false witness against us.</p>
<note type="footnote">57 Thirlby remarks that the serpent was the symbol specially of eternity, of power, and of wisdom, and that
there was scarcely any divine attribute to which the heathen did not find some likeness in this animal. See also

<p>For among us the prince of the wicked spirits is called the serpent, and Satan, and the
devil, as you can learn by looking into our writings. And that he would be sent into the fire
with his host, and the men who follow him, and would be punished for an endless duration,
Christ foretold. For the reason why God has delayed to do this, is His regard for the human
race. For He foreknows that some are to be saved by repentance, some even that are perhaps
not yet born.59 In the beginning He made the human race with the power of thought and
of choosing the truth and doing right, so that all men are without excuse before God; for
they have been born rational and contemplative. And if any one disbelieves that God cares
for these things,60 he will thereby either insinuate that God does not exist, or he will assert
that though He exists He delights in vice, or exists like a stone, and that neither virtue nor
vice are anything, but only in the opinion of men these things are reckoned good or evil.
And this is the greatest profanity and wickedness.</p>

or whether we decline marriage, we live continently. And that you may understand that
promiscuous intercourse is not one of our mysteries, one of our number a short time ago
presented to Felix the governor in Alexandria a petition, craving that permission might be
given to a surgeon to make him an eunuch. For the surgeons there said that they were forbidden
to do this without the permission of the governor. And when Felix absolutely refused
to sign such a permission, the youth remained single, and was satisfied with his own approving
conscience, and the approval of those who thought as he did. And it is not out of place,

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Of the Hebrew prophets.</head>
<p>There were, then, among the Jews certain men who were prophets of God, through
whom the prophetic Spirit published beforehand things that were to come to pass, ere ever
they happened. And their prophecies, as they were spoken and when they were uttered, the
kings who happened to be reigning among the Jews at the several times carefully preserved
in their possession, when they had been arranged in books by the prophets themselves in
their own Hebrew language. And when Ptolemy king of Egypt formed a library, and endeavoured
to collect the writings of all men, he heard also of these prophets, and sent to Herod,
who was at that time king of the Jews,62 requesting that the books of the prophets be sent
to him. And Herod the king did indeed send them, written, as they were, in the foresaid
Hebrew language. And when their contents were found to be unintelligible to the Egyptians,
he again sent and requested that men be commissioned to translate them into the Greek
language. And when this was done, the books remained with the Egyptians, where they are
until now. They are also in the possession of all Jews throughout the world; but they, though
they read, do not understand what is said, but count us foes and enemies; and, like yourselves,
they kill and punish us whenever they have the power, as you can well believe. For in the
Jewish war which lately raged, Barchochebas, the leader of the revolt of the Jews, gave orders
that Christians alone should be led to cruel punishments, unless they would deny Jesus
Christ and utter blasphemy. In these books, then, of the prophets we found Jesus our Christ
foretold as coming, born of a virgin, growing up to man’s estate, and healing every disease
and every sickness, and raising the dead, and being hated, and unrecognised, and crucified,
and dying, and rising again, and ascending into heaven, and being, and being called, the
Son of God. We find it also predicted that certain persons should be sent by Him into every
nation to publish these things, and that rather among the Gentiles [than among the Jews]
men should believe on Him. And He was predicted before He appeared, first 5000 years
before, and again 3000, then 2000, then 1000, and yet again 800; for in the succession of
generations prophets after prophets arose.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Christ predicted by Moses.</head>
<p>Moses then, who was the first of the prophets, spoke in these very words: “The sceptre
shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom
it is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the nations, binding His foal to the vine, washing
His robe in the blood of the grape.”63 It is yours to make accurate inquiry, and ascertain up
to whose time the Jews had a lawgiver and king of their own. Up to the time of Jesus Christ,
who taught us, and interpreted the prophecies which were not yet understood, [they had a
lawgiver] as was foretold by the holy and divine Spirit of prophecy through Moses, “that a
ruler would not fail the Jews until He should come for whom the kingdom was reserved”
(for Judah was the forefather of the Jews, from whom also they have their name of Jews);
and after He (i.e., Christ) appeared, you began to rule the Jews, and gained possession of all
their territory. And the prophecy, “He shall be the expectation of the nations,” signified that
there would be some of all nations who should look for Him to come again. And this indeed
you can see for yourselves, and be convinced of by fact. For of all races of men there are
some who look for Him who was crucified in Judæa, and after whose crucifixion the land
was straightway surrendered to you as spoil of war. And the prophecy, “binding His foal to
the vine, and washing His robe in the blood of the grape,” was a significant symbol of the
things that were to happen to Christ, and of what He was to do. For the foal of an ass stood
bound to a vine at the entrance of a village, and He ordered His acquaintances to bring it
to Him then; and when it was brought, He mounted and sat upon it, and entered Jerusalem,
where was the vast temple of the Jews which was afterwards destroyed by you. And after
this He was crucified, that the rest of the prophecy might be fulfilled. For this “washing His
robe in the blood of the grape” was predictive of the passion He was to endure, cleansing
by His blood those who believe on Him. For what is called by the Divine Spirit through the
prophet “His robe,” are those men who believe in Him in whom abideth the seed64 of God,
the Word. And what is spoken of as “the blood of the grape,” signifies that He who should
appear would have blood, though not of the seed of man, but of the power of God. And the
first power after God the Father and Lord of all is the Word, who is also the Son; and of
Him we will, in what follows, relate how He took flesh and became man. For as man did
not make the blood of the vine, but God, so it was hereby intimated that the blood should
not be of human seed, but of divine power, as we have said above. And Isaiah, another
prophet, foretelling the same things in other words, spoke thus: “A star shall rise out of
Jacob, and a flower shall spring from the root of Jesse; and His arm shall the nations trust."65

And a star of light has arisen, and a flower has sprung from the root of Jesse—this Christ.
For by the power of God He was conceived by a virgin of the seed of Jacob, who was the
father of Judah, who, as we have shown, was the father of the Jews; and Jesse was His forefather
according to the oracle, and He was the son of Jacob and Judah according to lineal
descent.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Manner of Christ’s birth predicted.</head>
<p>And hear again how Isaiah in express words foretold that He should be born of a virgin;
for he spoke thus: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall say
for His name, ‘God with us.’ ”66 For things which were incredible and seemed impossible
with men, these God predicted by the Spirit of prophecy as about to come to pass, in order
that, when they came to pass, there might be no unbelief, but faith, because of their prediction.
But lest some, not understanding the prophecy now cited, should charge us with the very
things we have been laying to the charge of the poets who say that Jupiter went in to women
through lust, let us try to explain the words. This, then, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive,”
signifies that a virgin should conceive without intercourse. For if she had had intercourse
with any one whatever, she was no longer a virgin; but the power of God having come upon
the virgin, overshadowed her, and caused her while yet a virgin to conceive. And the angel
of God who was sent to the same virgin at that time brought her good news, saying, “Behold,
thou shalt conceive of the Holy Ghost, and shalt bear a Son, and He shall be called the Son
of the Highest, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their
sins,”67—as they who have recorded all that concerns our Saviour Jesus Christ have taught,
whom we believed, since by Isaiah also, whom we have now adduced, the Spirit of prophecy
declared that He should be born as we intimated before. It is wrong, therefore, to understand
the Spirit and the power of God as anything else than the Word, who is also the first-born
of God, as the foresaid prophet Moses declared; and it was this which, when it came upon
the virgin and overshadowed her, caused her to conceive, not by intercourse, but by power.
And the name Jesus in the Hebrew language means Σωτήρ (Saviour) in the Greek tongue.
Wherefore, too, the angel said to the virgin, “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall
save His people from their sins.” And that the prophets are inspired68 by no other than the
Divine Word, even you, as I fancy, will grant.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Other fulfilled prophecies.</head>
<p>And how Christ after He was born was to escape the notice of other men until He grew
to man’s estate, which also came to pass, hear what was foretold regarding this. There are
the following predictions:70—“Unto us a child is born, and unto us a young man is given,
and the government shall be upon His shoulders;”71 which is significant of the power of the
cross, for to it, when He was crucified, He applied His shoulders, as shall be more clearly
made out in the ensuing discourse. And again the same prophet Isaiah, being inspired by
the prophetic Spirit, said, “I have spread out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
people, to those who walk in a way that is not good. They now ask of me judgment, and
dare to draw near to God.”72 And again in other words, through another prophet, He says,
“They pierced My hands and My feet, and for My vesture they cast lots.”73 And indeed
David, the king and prophet, who uttered these things, suffered none of them; but Jesus
Christ stretched forth His hands, being crucified by the Jews speaking against Him, and
denying that He was the Christ. And as the prophet spoke, they tormented Him, and set
Him on the judgment-seat, and said, Judge us. And the expression, “They pierced my hands
and my feet,” was used in reference to the nails of the cross which were fixed in His hands
and feet. And after He was crucified they cast lots upon His vesture, and they that crucified
Him parted it among them. And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the
Acts of Pontius Pilate.74 And we will cite the prophetic utterances of another prophet,
Zephaniah,75 to the effect that He was foretold expressly as to sit upon the foal of an ass and
to enter Jerusalem. The words are these: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O
daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee; lowly, and riding upon an ass,
and upon a colt the foal of an ass.”76</p>
<note type="footnote">70 These predictions have so little reference to the point Justin intends to make out, that some editors have

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—Different modes of prophecy.</head>
<p>But when you hear the utterances of the prophets spoken as it were personally, you must
not suppose that they are spoken by the inspired themselves, but by the Divine Word who
moves them. For sometimes He declares things that are to come to pass, in the manner of
one who foretells the future; sometimes He speaks as from the person of God the Lord and
Father of all; sometimes as from the person of Christ; sometimes as from the person of the
people answering the Lord or His Father, just as you can see even in your own writers, one
man being the writer of the whole, but introducing the persons who converse. And this the
Jews who possessed the books of the prophets did not understand, and therefore did not
recognise Christ even when He came, but even hate us who say that He has come, and who
prove that, as was predicted, He was crucified by them.</p>

his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, and My people hath not understood. Woe, sinful
nation, a people full of sins, a wicked seed, children that are transgressors, ye have forsaken
the Lord.”77 And again elsewhere, when the same prophet speaks in like manner from the
person of the Father, “What is the house that ye will build for Me? saith the Lord. The
heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool.”78 And again, in another place, “Your
new moons and your sabbaths My soul hateth; and the great day of the fast and of ceasing
from labour I cannot away with; nor, if ye come to be seen of Me, will I hear you: your hands
are full of blood; and if ye bring fine flour, incense, it is abomination unto Me: the fat of
lambs and the blood of bulls I do not desire. For who hath required this at your hands? But
loose every bond of wickedness, tear asunder the tight knots of violent contracts, cover the
houseless and naked, deal thy bread to the hungry.”79 What kind of things are taught through

cheeks to the buffetings; I turned not away My face from the shame of spittings; and the
Lord was My helper: therefore was I not confounded: but I set My face as a firm rock; and
I knew that I should not be ashamed, for He is near that justifieth Me.”81 And again, when
He says, “They cast lots upon My vesture, and pierced My hands and My feet. And I lay
down and slept, and rose again, because the Lord sustained Me.”82 And again, when He
says, “They spake with their lips, they wagged the head, saying, Let Him deliver Himself.”83
And that all these things happened to Christ at the hands of the Jews, you can ascertain. For
when He was crucified, they did shoot out the lip, and wagged their heads, saying, “Let Him
who raised the dead save Himself.”84</p>

He speaks in this way: “For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they
shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”85 And that it did
so come to pass, we can convince you. For from Jerusalem there went out into the world,
men, twelve in number, and these illiterate, of no ability in speaking: but by the power of
God they proclaimed to every race of men that they were sent by Christ to teach to all the
word of God; and we who formerly used to murder one another do not only now refrain
from making war upon our enemies, but also, that we may not lie nor deceive our examiners,
willingly die confessing Christ. For that saying, “The tongue has sworn, but the mind is
unsworn,”86 might be imitated by us in this matter. But if the soldiers enrolled by you, and
who have taken the military oath, prefer their allegiance to their own life, and parents, and
country, and all kindred, though you can offer them nothing incorruptible, it were verily
ridiculous if we, who earnestly long for incorruption, should not endure all things, in order
to obtain what we desire from Him who is able to grant it.</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—Christ’s advent foretold.</head>
<p>And hear how it was foretold concerning those who published His doctrine and proclaimed
His appearance, the above-mentioned prophet and king speaking thus by the
Spirit of prophecy “Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard. Their voice has gone out
into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the sun hath He set His tabernacle,
and he as a bridegroom going out of his chamber shall rejoice as a giant to run his
course.”87 And we have thought it right and relevant to mention some other prophetic utterances
of David besides these; from which you may learn how the Spirit of prophecy exhorts
men to live, and how He foretold the conspiracy which was formed against Christ by Herod
the king of the Jews, and the Jews themselves, and Pilate, who was your governor among
them, with his soldiers; and how He should be believed on by men of every race; and how
God calls Him His Son, and has declared that He will subdue all His enemies under Him;
and how the devils, as much as they can, strive to escape the power of God the Father and
Lord of all, and the power of Christ Himself; and how God calls all to repentance before the
day of judgment comes. These things were uttered thus: “Blessed is the man who hath not
walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of
the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law will he meditate day
and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which shall give his
fruit in his season; and his leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The
ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the
earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the council of
the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly
shall perish. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine new things? The kings of the
earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His
Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their yoke from us. He that
dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then
shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I been
set by Him a King on Zion His holy hill, declaring the decree of the Lord. The Lord said to
Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the
heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as Thy possession. Thou
shall herd them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shalt Thou dash them in pieces.

to be praised, to be feared above all the gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols of

<head>Chapter XLIII.—Responsibility asserted.</head>
<p>But lest some suppose, from what has been said by us, that we say that whatever happens,
happens by a fatal necessity, because it is foretold as known beforehand, this too we explain.
We have learned from the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements,
and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man’s actions.
Since if it be not so, but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power.
For if it be fated that this man, e.g., be good, and this other evil, neither is the former meritorious
nor the latter to be blamed. And again, unless the human race have the power of
avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they are not accountable for their actions,
of whatever kind they be. But that it is by free choice they both walk uprightly and stumble,
we thus demonstrate. We see the same man making a transition to opposite things. Now,
if it had been fated that he were to be either good or bad, he could never have been capable
of both the opposites, nor of so many transitions. But not even would some be good and
others bad, since we thus make fate the cause of evil, and exhibit her as acting in opposition
to herself; or that which has been already stated would seem to be true, that neither virtue
nor vice is anything, but that things are only reckoned good or evil by opinion; which, as
the true word shows, is the greatest impiety and wickedness. But this we assert is inevitable
fate, that they who choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose the opposite
have their merited awards. For not like other things, as trees and quadrupeds, which cannot
act by choice, did God make man: for neither would he be worthy of reward or praise did
he not of himself choose the good, but were created for this end;91 nor, if he were evil, would
he be worthy of punishment, not being evil of himself, but being able to be nothing else than
what he was made.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIV.—Not nullified by prophecy.</head>
<p>And the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God spoke thus
to the man first created: “Behold, before thy face are good and evil: choose the good.”92 And
again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following utterance was made as if from God
the Father and Lord of all: “Wash you, make you clean; put away evils from your souls; learn
to do well; judge the orphan, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together,
saith the Lord: And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool; and if they be
red like as crimson, I will make them white as snow. And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye
shall eat the good of the land; but if ye do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”93 And that expression, “The sword shall devour you,”
does not mean that the disobedient shall be slain by the sword, but the sword of God is fire,
of which they who choose to do wickedly become the fuel. Wherefore He says, “The sword
shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” And if He had spoken concerning
a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, shall devour. And so, too,
Plato, when he says, “The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless,”94 took this from
the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. And
whatever both philosophers and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul, or
punishments after death, or contemplation of things heavenly, or doctrines of the like kind,
they have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand
and interpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among all men; but
they are charged with not accurately understanding [the truth] when they assert contradictories.
So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came
about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being
His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several
value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to
the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to effort and recollection,
showing that He cares and provides for men. But by the agency of the devils death has been
decreed against those who read the books of Hystaspes, or of the Sibyl,95 or of the prophets,
that through fear they may prevent men who read them from receiving the knowledge of
the good, and may retain them in slavery to themselves; which, however, they could not always
effect. For not only do we fearlessly read them, but, as you see, bring them for your

power out of Jerusalem,” is predictive of the mighty word, which His apostles, going forth
from Jerusalem, preached everywhere; and though death is decreed against those who teach
or at all confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both embrace and teach it. And if you
also read these words in a hostile spirit, ye can do no more, as I said before, than kill us;
which indeed does no harm to us, but to you and all who unjustly hate us, and do not repent,

<head>Chapter XLVI.—The Word in the world before Christ.</head>
<p>But lest some should, without reason, and for the perversion of what we teach, maintain
that we say that Christ was born one hundred and fifty years ago under Cyrenius, and subsequently,
in the time of Pontius Pilate, taught what we say He taught; and should cry out
against us as though all men who were born before Him were irresponsible--let let us anticipate
and solve the difficulty. We have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and
we have declared above that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers;
and those who lived reasonably99 are Christians, even though they have been thought
atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them; and among the
barbarians, Abraham, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Mishael, and Elias, and many others
whose actions and names we now decline to recount, because we know it would be tedious.
So that even they who lived before Christ, and lived without reason, were wicked and hostile
to Christ, and slew those who lived reasonably. But who, through the power of the Word,
according to the will of God the Father and Lord of all, He was born of a virgin as a man,
and was named Jesus, and was crucified, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven,
an intelligent man will be able to comprehend from what has been already so largely said.
And we, since the proof of this subject is less needful now, will pass for the present to the
proof of those things which are urgent.</p>

<p>That the land of the Jews, then, was to be laid waste, hear what was said by the Spirit of

what had happened. They are these: “Sion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. The house
of our sanctuary has become a curse, and the glory which our fathers blessed is burned up
with fire, and all its glorious things are laid waste: and Thou refrainest Thyself at these things,
and hast held Thy peace, and hast humbled us very sore.”100 And ye are convinced that
Jerusalem has been laid waste, as was predicted. And concerning its desolation, and that no
one should be permitted to inhabit it, there was the following prophecy by Isaiah: “Their
land is desolate, their enemies consume it before them, and none of them shall dwell
therein.”101 And that it is guarded by you lest any one dwell in it, and that death is decreed

Me not: I said, Behold Me, to a nation that called not on My name. I spread out My hands
to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who walked in a way that is not good, but
follow after their own sins; a people that provoketh Me to anger to My face.”105 For the Jews
having the prophecies, and being always in expectation of the Christ to come, did not recognise
Him; and not only so, but even treated Him shamefully. But the Gentiles, who had
never heard anything about Christ, until the apostles set out from Jerusalem and preached
concerning Him, and gave them the prophecies, were filled with joy and faith, and cast away
their idols, and dedicated themselves to the Unbegotten God through Christ. And that it
was foreknown that these infamous things should be uttered against those who confessed
Christ, and that those who slandered Him, and said that it was well to preserve the ancient
customs, should be miserable, hear what was briefly said by Isaiah; it is this: “Woe unto

<p>But that, having become man for our sakes, He endured to suffer and to be dishonoured,
and that He shall come again with glory, hear the prophecies which relate to this; they are

He has borne the sin of many, and shall make intercession for the transgressors.
For, behold, My Servant shall deal prudently, and shall be exalted, and shall be greatly extolled.
As many were astonished at Thee, so marred shall Thy form be before men, and so
hidden from them Thy glory; so shall many nations wonder, and the kings shall shut their
mouths at Him. For they to whom it was not told concerning Him, and they who have not
heard, shall understand. O Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of
the Lord revealed? We have declared before Him as a child, as a root in a dry ground. He
had no form, nor glory; and we saw Him, and there was no form nor comeliness: but His
form was dishonoured and marred more than the sons of men. A man under the stroke,
and knowing how to bear infirmity, because His face was turned away: He was despised,
and of no reputation. It is He who bears our sins, and is afflicted for us; yet we did esteem
Him smitten, stricken, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was
bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of peace was upon Him, by His stripes we are
healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; every man has wandered in his own way. And
He delivered Him for our sins; and He opened not His mouth for all His affliction. He was
brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so He openeth
not His mouth. In His humiliation, His judgment was taken away.”107 Accordingly, after
He was crucified, even all His acquaintances forsook Him, having denied Him; and afterwards,
when He had risen from the dead and appeared to them, and had taught them to
read the prophecies in which all these things were foretold as coming to pass, and when
they had seen Him ascending into heaven, and had believed, and had received power sent
thence by Him upon them, and went to every race of men, they taught these things, and

will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death; because He did no violence,
neither was any deceit in His mouth. And the Lord is pleased to cleanse Him from the stripe.

<head>Chapter LII.—Certain fulfilment of prophecy.</head>
<p>Since, then, we prove that all things which have already happened had been predicted
by the prophets before they came to pass, we must necessarily believe also that those things
which are in like manner predicted, but are yet to come to pass, shall certainly happen. For
as the things which have already taken place came to pass when foretold, and even though
unknown, so shall the things that remain, even though they be unknown and disbelieved,
yet come to pass. For the prophets have proclaimed two advents of His: the one, that which
is already past, when He came as a dishonoured and suffering Man; but the second, when,
according to prophecy, He shall come from heaven with glory, accompanied by His angelic
host, when also He shall raise the bodies of all men who have lived, and shall clothe those
of the worthy with immortality, and shall send those of the wicked, endued with eternal
sensibility, into everlasting fire with the wicked devils. And that these things also have been
foretold as yet to be, we will prove. By Ezekiel the prophet it was said: “Joint shall be joined
to joint, and bone to bone, and flesh shall grow again; and every knee shall bow to the Lord,
and every tongue shall confess Him.”112 And in what kind of sensation and punishment
the wicked are to be, hear from what was said in like manner with reference to this; it is as
follows: “Their worm shall not rest, and their fire shall not be quenched;”113 and then shall
they repent, when it profits them not. And what the people of the Jews shall say and do,
when they see Him coming in glory, has been thus predicted by Zechariah the prophet: “I
will command the four winds to gather the scattered children; I will command the north
wind to bring them, and the south wind, that it keep not back. And then in Jerusalem there
shall be great lamentation, not the lamentation of mouths or of lips, but the lamentation of
the heart; and they shall rend not their garments, but their hearts. Tribe by tribe they shall
mourn, and then they shall look on Him whom they have pierced; and they shall say, Why,
O Lord, hast Thou made us to err from Thy way? The glory which our fathers blessed, has
for us been turned into shame.”114</p>

<head>Chapter LIII.—Summary of the prophecies.</head>
<p>Though we could bring forward many other prophecies, we forbear, judging these sufficient
for the persuasion of those who have ears to hear and understand; and considering
also that those persons are able to see that we do not make mere assertions without being
able to produce proof, like those fables that are told of the so-called sons of Jupiter. For with
what reason should we believe of a crucified man that He is the first-born of the unbegotten
God, and Himself will pass judgment on the whole human race, unless we had found testimonies
concerning Him published before He came and was born as man, and unless we
saw that things had happened accordingly—the devastation of the land of the Jews, and
men of every race persuaded by His teaching through the apostles, and rejecting their old
habits, in which, being deceived, they had their conversation; yea, seeing ourselves too, and
knowing that the Christians from among the Gentiles are both more numerous and more
true than those from among the Jews and Samaritans? For all the other human races are
called Gentiles by the Spirit of prophecy; but the Jewish and Samaritan races are called the
tribe of Israel, and the house of Jacob. And the prophecy in which it was predicted that there
should be more believers from the Gentiles than from the Jews and Samaritans, we will
produce: it ran thus: “Rejoice, O barren, thou that dost not bear; break forth and shout, thou
that dost not travail, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her that
hath an husband.”115 For all the Gentiles were “desolate” of the true God, serving the works
of their hands; but the Jews and Samaritans, having the word of God delivered to them by
the prophets, and always expecting the Christ, did not recognise Him when He came, except
some few, of whom the Spirit of prophecy by Isaiah had predicted that they should be saved.
He spoke as from their person: “Except the Lord had left us a seed, we should have been as
Sodom and Gomorrah.”116 For Sodom and Gomorrah are related by Moses to have been
cities of ungodly men, which God burned with fire and brimstone, and overthrew, no one
of their inhabitants being saved except a certain stranger, a Chaldæan by birth, whose name
was Lot; with whom also his daughters were rescued. And those who care may yet see their
whole country desolate and burned, and remaining barren. And to show how those from
among the Gentiles were foretold as more true and more believing, we will cite what was
said by Isaiah117 the prophet; for he spoke as follows “Israel is uncircumcised in heart, but
the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the flesh.” So many things therefore, as these, when they
are seen with the eye, are enough to produce conviction and belief in those who embrace
the truth, and are not bigoted in their opinions, nor are governed by their passions.</p>

<head>Chapter LIV.—Origin of heathen mythology.</head>
<p>But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof to
the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by
the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having
heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly
among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter,
under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things
which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which
were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all
nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would specially
be believed in; but that in hearing what was said by the prophets they did not accurately
understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like men who are in error, we will
make plain. The prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all writers;
and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted: “There shall not fail a prince
from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved;
and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His robe in
the blood of the grape.”118 The devils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words,
said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he was the discoverer of the vine,
and they number wine119 [or, the ass] among his mysteries; and they taught that, having
been torn in pieces, he ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had
not been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the Son of God, and
whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or ascend into heaven, and because
the name of “foal” could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not
knowing whether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the
sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of man, gave
out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven on his horse Pegasus.
And when they heard it said by the other prophet Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin,
and by His own means ascend into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And
when they knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the prophecies written aforetime,
“Strong as a giant to run his course,”120 they said that Hercules was strong, and had journeyed
over the whole earth. And when, again, they learned that it had been foretold that He should
heal every sickness, and raise the dead, they produced Æsculapius.</p>

<p>But in no instance, not even in any of those called sons of Jupiter, did they imitate the
being crucified; for it was not understood by them, all the things said of it having been put
symbolically. And this, as the prophet foretold, is the greatest symbol of His power and role;
as is also proved by the things which fall under our observation. For consider all the things
in the world, whether without this form they could be administered or have any community.
For the sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship;
and the earth is not ploughed without it: diggers and mechanics do not their work, except
with tools which have this shape. And the human form differs from that of the irrational
animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended, and having
on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose, through which there is
respiration for the living creature; and this shows no other form than that of the cross. And
so it was said by the prophet, “The breath before our face is the Lord Christ.”121 And the
power of this form is shown by your own symbols on what are called “vexilla” [banners]
and trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using these as the insignia of
your power and government, even though you do so unwittingly.122 And with this form
you consecrate the images of your emperors when they die, and you name them gods by
inscriptions. Since, therefore, we have urged you both by reason and by an evident form,

born among men, and when they learned how He had been foretold by the prophets, and
knew that He should be believed on and looked for by every nation, they again, as was said
above, put forward other men, the Samaritans Simon and Menander, who did many mighty
works by magic, and deceived many, and still keep them deceived. For even among yourselves,
as we said before,123 Simon was in the royal city Rome in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and
so greatly astonished the sacred senate and people of the Romans, that he was considered
a god, and honoured, like the others whom you honour as gods, with a statue. Wherefore
we pray that the sacred senate and your people may, along with yourselves, be arbiters of

in wicked customs, and are prejudiced in their own opinions, should kill and hate us; whom
we not only do not hate, but, as is proved, pity and endeavour to lead to repentance. For we
do not fear death, since it is acknowledged we must surely die; and there is nothing new,
but all things continue the same in this administration of things; and if satiety overtakes
those who enjoy even one year of these things, they ought to give heed to our doctrines, that
they may live eternally free both from suffering and from want. But if they believe that there
is nothing after death, but declare that those who die pass into insensibility, then they become
our benefactors when they set us free from sufferings and necessities of this life, and prove
themselves to be wicked, and inhuman, and bigoted. For they kill us with no intention of

the Christ predicted by the prophets is His Son, and preaches another god besides the Creator
of all, and likewise another son. And this man many have believed, as if he alone knew
the truth, and laugh at us, though they have no proof of what they say, but are carried away
irrationally as lambs by a wolf, and become the prey of atheistical doctrines, and of devils.
For they who are called devils attempt nothing else than to seduce men from God who made
them, and from Christ His first-begotten; and those who are unable to raise themselves
above the earth they have riveted, and do now rivet, to things earthly, and to the works of

<head>Chapter LIX.—Plato’s obligation to Moses.</head>
<p>And that you may learn that it was from our teachers—we mean the account given

which was shapeless, made the world, hear the very words spoken through Moses, who, as
above shown, was the first prophet, and of greater antiquity than the Greek writers; and
through whom the Spirit of prophecy, signifying how and from what materials God at first
formed the world, spake thus: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And
the earth was invisible and unfurnished, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and
the Spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and it was so.”
So that both Plato and they who agree with him, and we ourselves, have learned, and you
also can be convinced, that by the word of God the whole world was made out of the substance
spoken of before by Moses. And that which the poets call Erebus, we know was spoken
of formerly by Moses.124</p>

<head>Chapter LX.—Plato’s doctrine of the cross.</head>
<p>And the physiological discussion125 concerning the Son of God in the Timæus of Plato,
where he says, “He placed him crosswise126 in the universe,” he borrowed in like manner
from Moses; for in the writings of Moses it is related how at that time, when the Israelites
went out of Egypt and were in the wilderness, they fell in with poisonous beasts, both vipers
and asps, and every kind of serpent, which slew the people; and that Moses, by the inspiration
and influence of God, took brass, and made it into the figure of a cross, and set it in the holy
tabernacle, and said to the people, “If ye look to this figure, and believe, ye shall be saved
thereby.”127 And when this was done, it is recorded that the serpents died, and it is handed
down that the people thus escaped death. Which things Plato reading, and not accurately
understanding, and not apprehending that it was the figure of the cross, but taking it to be
a placing crosswise, he said that the power next to the first God was placed crosswise in the
universe. And as to his speaking of a third, he did this because he read, as we said above,
that which was spoken by Moses, “that the Spirit of God moved over the waters.” For he
gives the second place to the Logos which is with God, who he said was placed crosswise in
the universe; and the third place to the Spirit who was said to be borne upon the water,
saying, “And the third around the third.”128 And hear how the Spirit of prophecy signified
through Moses that there should be a conflagration. He spoke thus: “Everlasting fire shall
descend, and shall devour to the pit beneath.”129 It is not, then, that we hold the same
opinions as others, but that all speak in imitation of ours. Among us these things can be
heard and learned from persons who do not even know the forms of the letters, who are
uneducated and barbarous in speech, though wise and believing in mind; some, indeed,
even maimed and deprived of eyesight; so that you may understand that these things are
not the effect of human wisdom, but are uttered by the power of God.</p>

<p>I will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when we had been
made new through Christ; lest, if we omit this, we seem to be unfair in the explanation we
are making. As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and
undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with
fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then
they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in
which we were ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the
universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the
washing with water. For Christ also said, “Except ye be born again, ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven.”130 Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born
to enter into their mothers’ wombs, is manifest to all. And how those who have sinned and
repent shall escape their sins, is declared by Esaias the prophet, as I wrote above;131 he thus
speaks: “Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn
to do well; judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together,
saith the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white like wool; and
though they be as crimson, I will make them white as snow. But if ye refuse and rebel, the
sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”132</p>
<p>And for this [rite] we have learned from the apostles this reason. Since at our birth we
were born without our own knowledge or choice, by our parents coming together, and were
brought up in bad habits and wicked training; in order that we may not remain the children
of necessity and of ignorance, but may become the children of choice and knowledge, and
may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over
him who chooses to be born again, and has repented of his sins, the name of God the Father
and Lord of the universe; he who leads to the laver the person that is to be washed calling
him by this name alone. For no one can utter the name of the ineffable God; and if any one
dare to say that there is a name, he raves with a hopeless madness. And this washing is called
illumination, because they who learn these things are illuminated in their understandings.
And in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name
of the Holy Ghost, who through the prophets foretold all things about Jesus, he who is illuminated
is washed.</p>

<p>And the devils, indeed, having heard this washing published by the prophet, instigated
those who enter their temples, and are about to approach them with libations and burntofferings,
also to sprinkle themselves; and they cause them also to wash themselves entirely,
as they depart [from the sacrifice], before they enter into the shrines in which their images
are set. And the command, too, given by the priests to those who enter and worship in the
temples, that they take off their shoes, the devils, learning what happened to the abovementioned
prophet Moses, have given in imitation of these things. For at that juncture,
when Moses was ordered to go down into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites
who were there, and while he was tending the flocks of his maternal uncle133 in the land of
Arabia, our Christ conversed with him under the appearance of fire from a bush, and said,
“Put off thy shoes, and draw near and hear.” And he, when he had put off his shoes and
drawn near, heard that he was to go down into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites
there; and he received mighty power from Christ, who spoke to him in the appearance of
fire, and went down and led out the people, having done great and marvellous things; which,
if you desire to know, you will learn them accurately from his writings.</p>

<head>Chapter LXIII.—How God appeared to Moses.</head>
<p>And all the Jews even now teach that the nameless God spake to Moses; whence the
Spirit of prophecy, accusing them by Isaiah the prophet mentioned above, said “The ox
knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know Me, and My
people do not understand.”134 And Jesus the Christ, because the Jews knew not what the
Father was, and what the Son, in like manner accused them; and Himself said, “No one
knoweth the Father, but the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and they to whom the Son
revealeth Him.”135 Now the Word of God is His Son, as we have before said. And He is
called Angel and Apostle; for He declares whatever we ought to know, and is sent forth to
declare whatever is revealed; as our Lord Himself says, “He that heareth Me, heareth Him
that sent Me.”136 From the writings of Moses also this will be manifest; for thus it is written
in them, “And the Angel of God spake to Moses, in a flame of fire out of the bush, and said,
I am that I am, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of thy
fathers; go down into Egypt, and bring forth My people.”137 And if you wish to learn what
follows, you can do so from the same writings; for it is impossible to relate the whole here.
But so much is written for the sake of proving that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and
His Apostle, being of old the Word, and appearing sometimes in the form of fire, and
sometimes in the likeness of angels; but now, by the will of God, having become man for
the human race, He endured all the sufferings which the devils instigated the senseless Jews
to inflict upon Him; who, though they have it expressly affirmed in the writings of Moses,
“And the angel of God spake to Moses in a flame of fire in a bush, and said, I am that I am,
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,” yet maintain that He
who said this was the Father and Creator of the universe. Whence also the Spirit of prophecy
rebukes them, and says, “Israel doth not know Me, my people have not understood Me.”138
And again, Jesus, as we have already shown, while He was with them, said, “No one knoweth
the Father, but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, and those to whom the Son will reveal
Him.”139 The Jews, accordingly, being throughout of opinion that it was the Father of the
universe who spake to Moses, though He who spake to him was indeed the Son of God, who
is called both Angel and Apostle, are justly charged, both by the Spirit of prophecy and by
Christ Himself, with knowing neither the Father nor the Son. For they who affirm that the
Son is the Father, are proved neither to have become acquainted with the Father, nor to

know that the Father of the universe has a Son; who also, being the first-begotten Word of
God, is even God. And of old He appeared in the shape of fire and in the likeness of an angel
to Moses and to the other prophets; but now in the times of your reign,140 having, as we
before said, become Man by a virgin, according to the counsel of the Father, for the salvation
of those who believe on Him, He endured both to be set at nought and to suffer, that by
dying and rising again He might conquer death. And that which was said out of the bush
to Moses, “I am that I am, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
and the God of your fathers,”141 this signified that they, even though dead, are yet in existence,
and are men belonging to Christ Himself. For they were the first of all men to busy
themselves in the search after God; Abraham being the father of Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob,
as Moses wrote.</p>

<head>Chapter LXIV.—Further misrepresentations of the truth.</head>
<p>From what has been already said, you can understand how the devils, in imitation of
what was said by Moses, asserted that Proserpine was the daughter of Jupiter, and instigated
the people to set up an image of her under the name of Kore [Cora, i.e., the maiden or
daughter] at the spring-heads. For, as we wrote above,142 Moses said, “In the beginning
God made the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and unfurnished: and
the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” In imitation, therefore, of what is here
said of the Spirit of God moving on the waters, they said that Proserpine [or Cora] was the
daughter of Jupiter.143 And in like manner also they craftily feigned that Minerva was the
daughter of Jupiter, not by sexual union, but, knowing that God conceived and made the
world by the Word, they say that Minerva is the first conception [ἔννοια]; which we consider
to be very absurd, bringing forward the form of the conception in a female shape. And in
like manner the actions of those others who are called sons of Jupiter sufficiently condemn
them.</p>

<p>But we, after we have thus washed him who has been convinced and has assented to
our teaching, bring him to the place where those who are called brethren are assembled, in
order that we may offer hearty prayers in common for ourselves and for the baptized [illuminated]
person, and for all others in every place, that we may be counted worthy, now that
we have learned the truth, by our works also to be found good citizens and keepers of the
commandments, so that we may be saved with an everlasting salvation. Having ended the
prayers, we salute one another with a kiss.144 There is then brought to the president of the
brethren145 bread and a cup of wine mixed with water; and he taking them, gives praise and
glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and
offers thanks at considerable length for our being counted worthy to receive these things at
His hands. And when he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all the people present
express their assent by saying Amen. This word Amen answers in the Hebrew language to
γένοιτο [so be it]. And when the president has given thanks, and all the people have expressed
their assent, those who are called by us deacons give to each of those present to partake of
the bread and wine mixed with water over which the thanksgiving was pronounced, and to
those who are absent they carry away a portion.</p>
<note type="footnote">144 The kiss of charity, the kiss of peace, or “the peace” (ἡ εἰπήνη), was enjoined by the Apostle Paul in his
Epistles to the Corinthians, Thessalonians, and Romans, and thence passed into a common Christian usage. It
was continued in the Western Church, under regulations to prevent its abuse, until the thirteenth century.

<p>And this food is called among us Εὐχαριστία146 [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed
to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who
has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration,
and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink
do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh
by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been
taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood
and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made
flesh.147 For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have
thus delivered unto us what was enjoined upon them; that Jesus took bread, and when He
had given thanks, said, “This do ye in remembrance of Me,148 this is My body;” and that,
after the same manner, having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, “This is My blood;”
and gave it to them alone. Which the wicked devils have imitated in the mysteries of Mithras,
commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with
certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can

dissent from the opinion that the language is “inexact:” he expresses himself naturally as one who believes it is

<p>And we afterwards continually remind each other of these things. And the wealthy
among us help the needy; and we always keep together; and for all things wherewith we are
supplied, we bless the Maker of all through His Son Jesus Christ, and through the Holy
Ghost. And on the day called Sunday,149 all who live in cities or in the country gather together
to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read,
as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs,
and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and,
as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the
president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability,150 and
the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of
that over which thanks have been given,151 and to those who are absent a portion is sent by
the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what
is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those
who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the
strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need. But Sunday
is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which
God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ
our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead. For He was crucified on the day before

<p>And if these things seem to you to be reasonable and true, honour them; but if they

have done no wrong, as you would against enemies. For we forewarn you, that you shall

will invite you to do that which is pleasing to God. And though from the letter of the greatest
and most illustrious Emperor Adrian, your father, we could demand that you order judgment
to be given as we have desired, yet we have made this appeal and explanation, not on the
ground of Adrian’s decision, but because we know that what we ask is just. And we have

Accordingly, if the inhabitants of your province will so far sustain this petition of theirs as
to accuse the Christians in some court of law, I do not prohibit them from doing so. But I
will not suffer them to make use of mere entreaties and outcries. For it is far more just, if
any one desires to make an accusation, that you give judgment upon it. If, therefore, any
one makes the accusation, and furnishes proof that the said men do anything contrary to
the laws, you shall adjudge punishments in proportion to the offences. And this, by Hercules,
you shall give special heed to, that if any man shall, through mere calumny, bring an accusation
against any of these persons, you shall award to him more severe punishments in
proportion to his wickedness.</p>

<p>The Emperor Cæsar Titus Ælius Adrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Supreme Pontiff,
in the fifteenth year of his tribuneship, Consul for the third time, Father of the fatherland,
to the Common Assembly of Asia, greeting: I should have thought that the gods themselves
would see to it that such offenders should not escape. For if they had the power, they
themselves would much rather punish those who refuse to worship them; but it is you who
bring trouble on these persons, and accuse as the opinion of atheists that which they hold,
and lay to their charge certain other things which we are unable to prove. But it would be
advantageous to them that they should be thought to die for that of which they are accused,
and they conquer you by being lavish of their lives rather than yield that obedience which
you require of them. And regarding the earthquakes which have already happened and are
now occurring, it is not seemly that you remind us of them, losing heart whenever they occur,
and thus set your conduct in contrast with that of these men; for they have much greater
confidence towards God than you yourselves have. And you, indeed, seem at such times to
ignore the gods, and you neglect the temples, and make no recognition of the worship of
God. And hence you are jealous of those who do serve Him, and persecute them to the
death. Concerning such persons, some others also of the governors of provinces wrote to
my most divine father; to whom he replied that they should not at all disturb such persons,
unless they were found to be attempting anything against the Roman government. And to
myself many have sent intimations regarding such persons, to whom I also replied in pursuance
of my father’s judgment. But if any one has a matter to bring against any person of
this class, merely as such a person,154 let the accused be acquitted of the charge, even though
he should be found to be such a one; but let the accuser be amenable to justice.</p>

<p>The Emperor Cæsar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, Germanicus, Parthicus, Sarmaticus,
to the People of Rome, and to the sacred Senate greeting: I explained to you my grand design,
and what advantages I gained on the confines of Germany, with much labour and suffering,
in consequence of the circumstance that I was surrounded by the enemy; I myself being
shut up in Carnuntum by seventy-four cohorts, nine miles off. And the enemy being at
hand, the scouts pointed out to us, and our general Pompeianus showed us that there was
close on us a mass of a mixed multitude of 977,000 men, which indeed we saw; and I was
shut up by this vast host, having with me only a battalion composed of the first, tenth, double
and marine legions. Having then examined my own position, and my host, with respect to
the vast mass of barbarians and of the enemy, I quickly betook myself to prayer to the gods
of my country. But being disregarded by them, I summoned those who among us go by the
name of Christians. And having made inquiry, I discovered a great number and vast host
of them, and raged against them, which was by no means becoming; for afterwards I learned
their power. Wherefore they began the battle, not by preparing weapons, nor arms, nor
bugles; for such preparation is hateful to them, on account of the God they bear about in
their conscience. Therefore it is probable that those whom we suppose to be atheists, have
God as their ruling power entrenched in their conscience. For having cast themselves on
the ground, they prayed not only for me, but also for the whole army as it stood, that they
might be delivered from the present thirst and famine. For during five days we had got no
water, because there was none; for we were in the heart of Germany, and in the enemy’s
territory. And simultaneously with their casting themselves on the ground, and praying to
God (a God of whom I am ignorant), water poured from heaven, upon us most refreshingly
cool, but upon the enemies of Rome a withering156 hail. And immediately we recognised
the presence of God following on the prayer-a God unconquerable and indestructible.
Founding upon this, then, let us pardon such as are Christians, lest they pray for and obtain
such a weapon against ourselves. And I counsel that no such person be accused on the
ground of his being a Christian. But if any one be found laying to the charge of a Christian
that he is a Christian, I desire that it be made manifest that he who is accused as a Christian,
and acknowledges that he is one, is accused of nothing else than only this, that he is a
Christian; but that he who arraigns him be burned alive. And I further desire, that he who
is entrusted with the government of the province shall not compel the Christian, who confesses
and certifies such a matter, to retract; neither shall he commit him. And I desire that

these things be confirmed by a decree of the Senate. And I command this my edict to be

<head>Chapter II.—Urbicus condemns the Christians to death.</head>
<p>A certain woman lived with an intemperate161 husband; she herself, too, having formerly
been intemperate. But when she came to the knowledge of the teachings of Christ she became
sober-minded, and endeavoured to persuade her husband likewise to be temperate, citing
the teaching of Christ, and assuring him that there shall be punishment in eternal fire inflicted
upon those who do not live temperately and conformably to right reason. But he, continuing
in the same excesses, alienated his wife from him by his actions. For she, considering it
wicked to live any longer as a wife with a husband who sought in every way means of indulging
in pleasure contrary to the law of nature, and in violation of what is right, wished to
be divorced from him. And when she was overpersuaded by her friends, who advised her
still to continue with him, in the idea that some time or other her husband might give hope
of amendment, she did violence to her own feeling and remained with him. But when her
husband had gone into Alexandria, and was reported to be conducting himself worse than
ever, she—that she might not, by continuing in matrimonial connection with him, and by
sharing his table and his bed, become a partaker also in his wickednesses and impieties—gave
him what you call a bill of divorce,162 and was separated from him. But this noble husband
of hers,—while he ought to have been rejoicing that those actions which formerly she unhesitatingly
committed with the servants and hirelings, when she delighted in drunkenness
and every vice, she had now given up, and desired that he too should give up the same,—when
she had gone from him without his desire, brought an accusation against her, affirming that
she was a Christian. And she presented a paper to thee, the Emperor,163 requesting that first
she be permitted to arrange her affairs, and afterwards to make her defence against the ac-
cusation, when her affairs were set in order. And this you granted. And her quondam husband,
since he was now no longer able to prosecute her, directed his assaults against a man,
Ptolemæus, whom Urbicus punished, and who had been her teacher in the Christian doctrines.
And this he did in the following way. He persuaded a centurion —who had cast
Ptolemæus into prison, and who was friendly to himself—to take Ptolemæus and interrogate
him on this sole point: whether he were a Christian? And Ptolemæus, being a lover of truth,
and not of a deceitful or false disposition, when he confessed himself to be a Christian, was
bound by the centurion, and for a long time punished in the prison. And, at last, when the
man164 came to Urbicus, he was asked this one question only: whether he was a Christian?

<pb n="505"/>
And again, being conscious of his duty, and the nobility of it through the teaching of Christ,
he confessed his discipleship in the divine virtue. For he who denies anything either denies
it because he condemns the thing itself, or he shrinks from confession because he is conscious
of his own unworthiness or alienation from it, neither of which cases is that of the true
Christian. And when Urbicus ordered him to be led away to punishment, one Lucius, who
was also himself a Christian, seeing the unreasonable judgment that had thus been given,
said to Urbicus: “What is the ground of this judgment? Why have you punished this man,
not as an adulterer, nor fornicator, nor murderer, nor thief, nor robber, nor convicted of
any crime at all, but who has only confessed that he is called by the name of Christian? This
judgment of yours, O Urbicus, does not become the Emperor Pius, nor the philosopher, the
son of Cæsar, nor the sacred senate.”165 And he said nothing else in answer to Lucius than
this: “You also seem to me to be such an one.” And when Lucius answered, “Most certainly
I am,” he again ordered him also to be led away. And he professed his thanks, knowing that
he was delivered from such wicked rulers, and was going to the Father and King of the
heavens. And still a third having come forward, was condemned to be punished.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Justin accuses Crescens ofignorant prejudice against the Christians.</head>
<p>I too, therefore, expect to be plotted against and fixed to the stake, by some of those I
have named, or perhaps by Crescens, that lover of bravado and boasting;166 for the man is
not worthy of the name of philosopher who publicly bears witness against us in matters
which he does not understand, saying that the Christians are atheists and impious, and doing
so to win favour with the deluded mob, and to please them. For if he assails us without
having read the teachings of Christ, he is thoroughly depraved, and far worse than the illiterate,
who often refrain from discussing or bearing false witness about matters they do not
understand. Or, if he has read them and does not understand the majesty that is in them,
or, understanding it, acts thus that he may not be suspected of being such [a Christian], he
is far more base and thoroughly depraved, being conquered by illiberal and unreasonable
opinion and fear. For I would have you to know that I proposed to him certain questions
on this subject, and interrogated him, and found most convincingly that he, in truth, knows
nothing. And to prove that I speak the truth, I am ready, if these disputations have not been
reported to you, to conduct them again in your presence. And this would be an act worthy
of a prince. But if my questions and his answers have been made known to you, you are
already aware that he is acquainted with none of our matters; or, if he is acquainted with
them, but, through fear of those who might hear him, does not dare to speak out, like Socrates,
he proves himself, as I said before, no philosopher, but an opinionative man;167 at least he
does not regard that Socratic and most admirable saying: “But a man must in no wise be
honoured before the truth.”168 But it is impossible for a Cynic, who makes indifference his
end, to know any good but indifference.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Why the Christians do not kill themselves.</head>
<p>But lest some one say to us, “Go then all of you and kill yourselves, and pass even now
to God, and do not trouble us,” I will tell you why we do not so, but why, when examined,
we fearlessly confess. We have been taught that God did not make the world aimlessly, but
for the sake of the human race; and we have before stated that He takes pleasure in those
who imitate His properties, and is displeased with those that embrace what is worthless
either in word or deed. If, then, we all kill ourselves, we shall become the cause, as far as in
us lies, why no one should be born, or instructed in the divine doctrines, or even why the
human race should not exist; and we shall, if we so act, be ourselves acting in opposition to
the will of God. But when we are examined, we make no denial, because we are not conscious
of any evil, but count it impious not to speak the truth in all things, which also we know is
pleasing to God, and because we are also now very desirous to deliver you from an unjust
prejudice.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—How the angels transgressed.</head>
<p>But if this idea take possession of some one, that if we acknowledge God as our helper,
we should not, as we say, be oppressed and persecuted by the wicked; this, too, I will solve.
God, when He had made the whole world, and subjected things earthly to man, and arranged
the heavenly elements for the increase of fruits and rotation of the seasons, and appointed
this divine law—for these things also He evidently made for man—committed the care of
men and of all things under heaven to angels whom He appointed over them. But the angels
transgressed this appointment, and were captivated by love of women, and begat children
who are those that are called demons; and besides, they afterwards subdued the human race
to themselves, partly by magical writings, and partly by fears and the punishments they occasioned,
and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices, and incense, and libations, of which
things they stood in need after they were enslaved by lustful passions; and among men they
sowed murders, wars, adulteries, intemperate deeds, and all wickedness. Whence also the
poets and mythologists, not knowing that it was the angels and those demons who had been
begotten by them that did these things to men, and women, and cities, and nations, which
they related, ascribed them to god himself, and to those who were accounted to be his very
offspring, and to the offspring of those who were called his brothers, Neptune and Pluto,
and to the children again of these their offspring. For whatever name each of the angels had
given to himself and his children, by that name they called them.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Names of God and of Christ, their meaning and power.</head>
<p>But to the Father of all, who is unbegotten, there is no name given. For by whatever
name He be called, He has as His elder the person who gives Him the name. But these words,
Father, and God, and Creator, and Lord, and Master, are not names, but appellations derived
from His good deeds and functions. And His Son, who alone is properly called Son, the
Word, who also was with Him and was begotten before the works, when at first He created
and arranged all things by Him, is called Christ, in reference to His being anointed and
God’s ordering all things through Him; this name itself also containing an unknown significance;
as also the appellation “God” is not a name, but an opinion implanted in the nature
of men of a thing that can hardly be explained. But “Jesus,” His name as man and Saviour,
has also significance. For He was made man also, as we before said, having been conceived
according to the will of God the Father, for the sake of believing men, and for the destruction
of the demons. And now you can learn this from what is under your own observation. For
numberless demoniacs throughout the whole world, and in your city, many of our Christian
men exorcising them in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
have healed and do heal, rendering helpless and driving the possessing devils out of the
men, though they could not be cured by all the other exorcists, and those who used incantations
and drugs.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The world preserved for the sake of Christians. Man’s
responsibility.</head>
<p>Wherefore God delays causing the confusion and destruction of the whole world, by
which the wicked angels and demons and men shall cease to exist, because of the seed of
the Christians, who know that they are the cause of preservation in nature.169 Since, if it
were not so, it would not have been possible for you to do these things, and to be impelled
by evil spirits; but the fire of judgment would descend and utterly dissolve all things, even
as formerly the flood left no one but him only with his family who is by us called Noah, and
by you Deucalion, from whom again such vast numbers have sprung, some of them evil
and others good. For so we say that there will be the conflagration, but not as the Stoics,
according to their doctrine of all things being changed into one another, which seems most
degrading. But neither do we affirm that it is by fate that men do what they do, or suffer
what they suffer, but that each man by free choice acts rightly or sins; and that it is by the
influence of the wicked demons that earnest men, such as Socrates and the like, suffer persecution
and are in bonds, while Sardanapalus, Epicurus, and the like, seem to be blessed
in abundance and glory. The Stoics, not observing this, maintained that all things take place
according to the necessity of fate. But since God in the beginning made the race of angels
and men with free-will, they will justly suffer in eternal fire the punishment of whatever sins
they have committed. And this is the nature of all that is made, to be capable of vice and
virtue. For neither would any of them be praiseworthy unless there were power to turn to
both [virtue and vice]. And this also is shown by those men everywhere who have made
laws and philosophized according to right reason, by their prescribing to do some things
and refrain from others. Even the Stoic philosophers, in their doctrine of morals, steadily
honour the same things, so that it is evident that they are not very felicitous in what they
say about principles and incorporeal things. For if they say that human actions come to pass
by fate, they will maintain either that God is nothing else than the things which are ever
turning, and altering, and dissolving into the same things, and will appear to have had a
comprehension only of things that are destructible, and to have looked on God Himself as
emerging both in part and in whole in every wickedness;170 or that neither vice nor virtue
is anything; which is contrary to every sound idea, reason, and sense.</p>
<note type="footnote">169 This is Dr. Donaldson’s rendering of a clause on which the editors differ both as to reading and rendering.</note>

<p>And those of the Stoic school—since, so far as their moral teaching went, they were
admirable, as were also the poets in some particulars, on account of the seed of reason [the
Logos] implanted in every race of men—were, we know, hated and put to death,—Heraclitus
for instance, and, among those of our own time, Musonius and others. For, as we intimated,
the devils have always effected, that all those who anyhow live a reasonable and earnest life,
and shun vice, be hated. And it is nothing wonderful; if the devils are proved to cause those
to be much worse hated who live not according to a part only of the word diffused [among
men], but by the knowledge and contemplation of the whole Word, which is Christ. And
they, having been shut up in eternal fire, shall suffer their just punishment and penalty. For
if they are even now overthrown by men through the name of Jesus Christ, this is an intimation
of the punishment in eternal fire which is to be inflicted on themselves and those who
serve them. For thus did both all the prophets foretell, and our own teacher Jesus teach.171</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Eternal punishment not a mere threat.</head>
<p>And that no one may say what is said by those who are deemed philosophers, that our
assertions that the wicked are punished in eternal fire are big words and bugbears, and that
we wish men to live virtuously through fear, and not because such a life is good and pleasant;
I will briefly reply to this, that if this be not so, God does not exist; or, if He exists, He cares
not for men, and neither virtue nor vice is anything, and, as we said before, lawgivers unjustly
punish those who transgress good commandments. But since these are not unjust, and their
Father teaches them by the word to do the same things as Himself, they who agree with
them are not unjust. And if one object that the laws of men are diverse, and say that with
some, one thing is considered good, another evil, while with others what seemed bad to the
former is esteemed good, and what seemed good is esteemed bad, let him listen to what we
say to this. We know that the wicked angels appointed laws conformable to their own
wickedness, in which the men who are like them delight; and the right Reason,172 when He
came, proved that not all opinions nor all doctrines are good, but that some are evil, while
others are good. Wherefore, I will declare the same and similar things to such men as these,
and, if need be, they shall be spoken of more at large. But at present I return to the subject.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Christ compared with Socrates.</head>
<p>Our doctrines, then, appear to be greater than all human teaching; because Christ, who
appeared for our sakes, became the whole rational being, both body, and reason, and soul.
For whatever either lawgivers or philosophers uttered well, they elaborated by finding and
contemplating some part of the Word. But since they did not know the whole of the Word,
which is Christ, they often contradicted themselves. And those who by human birth were
more ancient than Christ, when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason,
were brought before the tribunals as impious persons and busybodies. And Socrates, who
was more zealous in this direction than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as
ourselves. For they said that he was introducing new divinities, and did not consider those
to be gods whom the state recognised. But he cast out from the state both Homer173 and
the rest of the poets, and taught men to reject the wicked demons and those who did the
things which the poets related; and he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God
who was to them unknown, by means of the investigation of reason, saying, “That it is
neither easy to find the Father and Maker of all, nor, having found Him, is it safe to declare
Him to all.”174 But these things our Christ did through His own power. For no one trusted
in Socrates so as to die for this doctrine, but in Christ, who was partially known even by
Socrates (for He was and is the Word who is in every man, and who foretold the things that
were to come to pass both through the prophets and in His own person when He was made
of like passions, and taught these things), not only philosophers and scholars believed, but
also artisans and people entirely uneducated, despising both glory, and fear, and death;
since He is a power of the ineffable Father, not the mere instrument of human reason.175</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—How Christians view death.</head>
<p>But neither should we be put to death, nor would wicked men and devils be more
powerful than we, were not death a debt due by every man that is born. Wherefore we give
thanks when we pay this debt. And we judge it right and opportune to tell here, for the sake
of Crescens and those who rave as he does, what is related by Xenophon. Hercules, says
Xenophon, coming to a place where three ways met, found Virtue and Vice, who appeared
to him in the form of women: Vice, in a luxurious dress, and with a seductive expression
rendered blooming by such ornaments, and her eyes of a quickly melting tenderness,176
said to Hercules that if he would follow her, she would always enable him to pass his life in
pleasure and adorned with the most graceful ornaments, such as were then upon her own
person; and Virtue, who was of squalid look and dress, said, But if you obey me, you shall
adorn yourself not with ornament nor beauty that passes away and perishes, but with everlasting
and precious graces. And we are persuaded that every one who flees those things
that seem to be good, and follows hard after what are reckoned difficult and strange, enters
into blessedness. For Vice, when by imitation of what is incorruptible (for what is really
incorruptible she neither has nor can produce) she has thrown around her own actions, as
a disguise, the properties of virtue, and qualities which are really excellent, leads captive
earthly-minded men, attaching to Virtue her own evil properties. But those who understood
the excellences which belong to that which is real, are also uncorrupt in virtue. And this
every sensible person ought to think both of Christians and of the athletes, and of those who
did what the poets relate of the so-called gods, concluding as much from our contempt of
death, even when it could be escaped.177</p>
<note type="footnote">176 Another reading is πρὸς τὰς ὄψεις, referring to the eyes of the beholder; and which may be rendered,

<head>Chapter XII.—Christians proved innocent by their contempt of death.</head>
<p>For I myself, too, when I was delighting in the doctrines of Plato, and heard the Christians
slandered, and saw them fearless of death, and of all other things which are counted fearful,
perceived that it was impossible that they could be living in wickedness and pleasure. For
what sensual or intemperate man, or who that counts it good to feast on human flesh,178
could welcome death that he might be deprived of his enjoyments, and would not rather
continue always the present life, and attempt to escape the observation of the rulers; and
much less would he denounce himself when the consequence would be death? This also the
wicked demons have now caused to be done by evil men. For having put some to death on
account of the accusations falsely brought against us, they also dragged to the torture our
domestics, either children or weak women, and by dreadful torments forced them to admit
those fabulous actions which they themselves openly perpetrate; about which we are the
less concerned, because none of these actions are really ours, and we have the unbegotten
and ineffable God as witness both of our thoughts and deeds. For why did we not even
publicly profess that these were the things which we esteemed good, and prove that these
are the divine philosophy, saying that the mysteries of Saturn are performed when we slay
a man, and that when we drink our fill of blood, as it is said we do, we are doing what you
do before that idol you honour, and on which you sprinkle the blood not only of irrational
animals, but also of men, making a libation of the blood of the slain by the hand of the most
illustrious and noble man among you? And imitating Jupiter and the other gods in sodomy
and shameless intercourse with woman, might we not bring as our apology the writings of
Epicurus and the poets? But because we persuade men to avoid such instruction, and all
who practise them and imitate such examples, as now in this discourse we have striven to
persuade you, we are assailed in every kind of way. But we are not concerned, since we know
that God is a just observer of all. But would that even now some one would mount a lofty
rostrum, and shout with a loud voice;179 “Be ashamed, be ashamed, ye who charge the
guiltless with those deeds which yourselves openly commit, and ascribe things which apply
to yourselves and to your gods to those who have not even the slightest sympathy with them.

<p>For I myself, when I discovered the wicked disguise which the evil spirits had thrown
around the divine doctrines of the Christians, to turn aside others from joining them, laughed
both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise itself, and at popular opinion;
and I confess that I both boast and with all my strength strive to be found a Christian; not
because the teachings of Plato are different from those of Christ, but because they are not
in all respects similar, as neither are those of the others, Stoics, and poets, and historians.
For each man spoke well in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic word,180 seeing
what was related to it. But they who contradict themselves on the more important points
appear not to have possessed the heavenly181 wisdom, and the knowledge which cannot be
spoken against. Whatever things were rightly said among all men, are the property of us
Christians. For next to God, we worship and love the Word who is from the unbegotten
and ineffable God, since also He became man for our sakes, that becoming a partaker of
our sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the writers were able to see realities
darkly through the sowing of the implanted word that was in them. For the seed and imitation
imparted according to capacity is one thing, and quite another is the thing itself, of which
there is the participation and imitation according to the grace which is from Him.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Introduction.</head>
<p>While I was going about one morning in the walks of the Xystus,184 a certain man, with
others in his company, having met me, and said, “Hail, O philosopher!” And immediately
after saying this, he turned round and walked along with me; his friends likewise followed
him. And I in turn having addressed him, said, “What is there important?”</p>
<p>And he replied, “I was instructed,” says he “by Corinthus the Socratic in Argos, that I
ought not to despise or treat with indifference those who array themselves in this dress185
but to show them all kindness, and to associate with them, as perhaps some advantage would
spring from the intercourse either to some such man or to myself. It is good, moreover, for
both, if either the one or the other be benefited. On this account, therefore, whenever I see
any one in such costume, I gladly approach him, and now, for the same reason, have I willingly
accosted you; and these accompany me, in the expectation of hearing for themselves
something profitable from you.”</p>

and I am a Hebrew of the circumcision,187 and having escaped from the war188 lately carried
on there I am spending my days in Greece, and chiefly at Corinth.”</p>
<p>“And in what,” said I, “would you be profited by philosophy so much as by your own
lawgiver and the prophets?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” he replied. “Do not the philosophers turn every discourse on God? and do
not questions continually arise to them about His unity and providence? Is not this truly
the duty of philosophy, to investigate the Deity?”</p>
<p>“Assuredly,” said I, “so we too have believed. But the most189 have not taken thought
of this, whether there be one or more gods, and whether they have a regard for each one of
us or no, as if this knowledge contributed nothing to our happiness; nay, they moreover
attempt to persuade us that God takes care of the universe with its genera and species, but
not of me and you, and each individually, since otherwise we would surely not need to pray
to Him night and day. But it is not difficult to understand the upshot of this; for fearlessness
and license in speaking result to such as maintain these opinions, doing and saying whatever

could they? They affirm that the same things shall always happen; and, further, that I and
you shall again live in like manner, having become neither better men nor worse. But there

that though they have committed evil they will not suffer punishment (for that which is
immaterial is insensible), and that the soul, in consequence of its immortality, needs nothing

<head>Chapter II.—Justin describes his studies in philosophy.</head>
<p>“I will tell you,” said I, “what seems to me; for philosophy is, in fact, the greatest possession,
and most honourable before God,191 to whom it leads us and alone commends us;
and these are truly holy men who have bestowed attention on philosophy. What philosophy
is, however, and the reason why it has been sent down to men, have escaped the observation
of most; for there would be neither Platonists, nor Stoics, nor Peripatetics, nor Theoretics,192
nor Pythagoreans, this knowledge being one.193 I wish to tell you why it has become manyheaded.
It has happened that those who first handled it [i.e., philosophy], and who were
therefore esteemed illustrious men, were succeeded by those who made no investigations
concerning truth, but only admired the perseverance and self-discipline of the former, as
well as the novelty of the doctrines; and each thought that to be true which he learned from
his teacher: then, moreover, those latter persons handed down to their successors such
things, and others similar to them; and this system was called by the name of him who was
styled the father of the doctrine. Being at first desirous of personally conversing with one
of these men, I surrendered myself to a certain Stoic; and having spent a considerable time
with him, when I had not acquired any further knowledge of God (for he did not know
himself, and said such instruction was unnecessary), I left him and betook myself to another,
who was called a Peripatetic, and as he fancied, shrewd. And this man, after having entertained
me for the first few days, requested me to settle the fee, in order that our intercourse
might not be unprofitable. Him, too, for this reason I abandoned, believing him to be no
philosopher at all. But when my soul was eagerly desirous to hear the peculiar and choice
philosophy, I came to a Pythagorean, very celebrated—a man who thought much of his own
wisdom. And then, when I had an interview with him, willing to become his hearer and
disciple, he said, ‘What then? Are you acquainted with music, astronomy, and geometry?
Do you expect to perceive any of those things which conduce to a happy life, if you have
not been first informed on those points which wean the soul from sensible objects, and
render it fitted for objects which appertain to the mind, so that it can contemplate that which
is honourable in its essence and that which is good in its essence?’ Having commended
many of these branches of learning, and telling me that they were necessary, he dismissed
me when I confessed to him my ignorance. Accordingly I took it rather impatiently, as was
to be expected when I failed in my hope, the more so because I deemed the man had some

knowledge; but reflecting again on the space of time during which I would have to linger
over those branches of learning, I was not able to endure longer procrastination. In my
helpless condition it occurred to me to have a meeting with the Platonists, for their fame
was great. I thereupon spent as much of my time as possible with one who had lately settled
in our city,194—a sagacious man, holding a high position among the Platonists,—and I
progressed, and made the greatest improvements daily. And the perception of immaterial
things quite overpowered me, and the contemplation of ideas furnished my mind with
wings,195 so that in a little while I supposed that I had become wise; and such was my stupidity,
I expected forthwith to look upon God, for this is the end of Plato’s philosophy.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Justin narrates the manner of his conversion.</head>
<p>“And while I was thus disposed, when I wished at one period to be filled with great
quietness, and to shun the path of men, I used to go into a certain field not far from the sea.
And when I was near that spot one day, which having reached I purposed to be by myself,
a certain old man, by no means contemptible in appearance, exhibiting meek and venerable
manners, followed me at a little distance. And when I turned round to him, having halted,
I fixed my eyes rather keenly on him.</p>
<p>“And he said, ‘Do you know me?’</p>
<p>“I replied in the negative.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why, then,’ said he to me, ‘do you so look at me?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am astonished,’ I said, ‘because you have chanced to be in my company in the same
place; for I had not expected to see any man here.’</p>
<p>“And he says to me, ‘I am concerned about some of my household. These are gone away
from me; and therefore have I come to make personal search for them, if, perhaps, they shall
make their appearance somewhere. But why are you here?’ said he to me.</p>
<p>“ ‘I delight,’ said I, ‘in such walks, where my attention is not distracted, for converse
with myself is uninterrupted; and such places are most fit for philology.’196</p>
<p>“ ‘Are you, then, a philologian,’197 said he, ‘but no lover of deeds or of truth? and do
you not aim at being a practical man so much as being a sophist?’</p>
<p>“ ‘What greater work,’ said I, ‘could one accomplish than this, to show the reason which
governs all, and having laid hold of it, and being mounted upon it, to look down on the errors
of others, and their pursuits? But without philosophy and right reason, prudence would not
be present to any man. Wherefore it is necessary for every man to philosophize, and to esteem
this the greatest and most honourable work; but other things only of second-rate or thirdrate
importance, though, indeed, if they be made to depend on philosophy, they are of
moderate value, and worthy of acceptance; but deprived of it, and not accompanying it,
they are vulgar and coarse to those who pursue them.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Does philosophy, then, make happiness?’ said he, interrupting.</p>
<p>“ ‘Assuredly,’ I said, ‘and it alone.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What, then, is philosophy?’ he says; ‘and what is happiness? Pray tell me, unless
something hinders you from saying.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Philosophy, then,’ said I, ‘is the knowledge of that which really exists, and a clear
perception of the truth; and happiness is the reward of such knowledge and wisdom.’</p>
<p>“ ‘But what do you call God?’ said he.</p>

<p>“ ‘That which always maintains the same nature, and in the same manner, and is the
cause of all other things —that, indeed, is God.’ So I answered him; and he listened to me
with pleasure, and thus again interrogated me:—</p>
<p>“ ‘Is not knowledge a term common to different matters? For in arts of all kinds, he who
knows any one of them is called a skilful man in the art of generalship, or of ruling, or of
healing equally. But in divine and human affairs it is not so. Is there a knowledge which affords
understanding of human and divine things, and then a thorough acquaintance with
the divinity and the righteousness of them?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Assuredly,’ I replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘What, then? Is it in the same way we know man and God, as we know music, and
arithmetic, and astronomy, or any other similar branch?’</p>
<p>“ ‘By no means,’ I replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘You have not answered me correctly, then,’ he said; ‘for some [branches of knowledge]
come to us by learning, or by some employment, while of others we have knowledge by
sight. Now, if one were to tell you that there exists in India an animal with a nature unlike
all others, but of such and such a kind, multiform and various, you would not know it before
you saw it; but neither would you be competent to give any account of it, unless you should
hear from one who had seen it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly not,’ I said.</p>
<p>“ ‘How then,’ he said, ‘should the philosophers judge correctly about God, or speak any
truth, when they have no knowledge of Him, having neither seen Him at any time, nor heard
Him?’</p>
<p>“ ‘But, father,’ said I, ‘the Deity cannot be seen merely by the eyes, as other living beings
can, but is discernible to the mind alone, as Plato says; and I believe him.’</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="526"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—The soul of itself cannot see God.</head>
<p>“ ‘Is there then,’ says he, ‘such and so great power in our mind? Or can a man not perceive
by sense sooner? Will the mind of man see God at any time, if it is uninstructed by the Holy
Spirit?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Plato indeed says,’ replied I, ‘that the mind’s eye is of such a nature, and has been
given for this end, that we may see that very Being when the mind is pure itself, who is the
cause of all discerned by the mind, having no colour, no form, no greatness—nothing, indeed,
which the bodily eye looks upon; but It is something of this sort, he goes on to say, that is
beyond all essence, unutterable and inexplicable, but alone honourable and good, coming
suddenly into souls well-dispositioned, on account of their affinity to and desire of seeing
Him.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What affinity, then,’ replied he, ‘is there between us and God? Is the soul also divine
and immortal, and a part of that very regal mind? And even as that sees God, so also is it
attainable by us to conceive of the Deity in our mind, and thence to become happy?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Assuredly,’ I said.</p>
<p>“ ‘And do all the souls of all living beings comprehend Him?’ he asked; ‘or are the souls
of men of one kind and the souls of horses and of asses of another kind?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No; but the souls which are in all are similar,’ I answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Then,’ says he, ‘shall both horses and asses see, or have they seen at some time or
other, God?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No,’ I said; ‘for the majority of men will not, saving such as shall live justly, purified
by righteousness, and by every other virtue.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It is not, therefore,’ said he, ‘on account of his affinity, that a man sees God, nor because
he has a mind, but because he is temperate and righteous?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes,’ said I; ‘and because he has that whereby he perceives God.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What then? Do goats or sheep injure any one?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No one in any respect,’ I said.</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore these animals will see [God] according to your account,’ says he.</p>
<p>“ ‘No; for their body being of such a nature, is an obstacle to them.’</p>
<p>“He rejoined, ‘If these animals could assume speech, be well assured that they would
with greater reason ridicule our body; but let us now dismiss this subject, and let it be conceded
to you as you say. Tell me, however, this: Does the soul see [God] so long as it is in
the body, or after it has been removed from it?’</p>
<p>“ ‘So long as it is in the form of a man, it is possible for it,’ I continue, ‘to attain to this
by means of the mind; but especially when it has been set free from the body, and being
apart by itself, it gets possession of that which it was wont continually and wholly to love.’
“ ‘Does it remember this, then [the sight of God], when it is again in the man?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It does not appear to me so,’ I said.</p>

<pb n="527"/>
<p>“ ‘What, then, is the advantage to those who have seen [God]? or what has he who has
seen more than he who has not seen, unless he remember this fact, that he has seen?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I cannot tell,’ I answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘And what do those suffer who are judged to be unworthy of this spectacle?’ said he.</p>
<p>“ ‘They are imprisoned in the bodies of certain wild beasts, and this is their punishment.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do they know, then, that it is for this reason they are in such forms, and that they
have committed some sin?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not think so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then these reap no advantage from their punishment, as it seems: moreover, I would
say that they are not punished unless they are conscious of the punishment.’</p>
<p>“ ‘No indeed.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore souls neither see God nor transmigrate into other bodies; for they would
know that so they are punished, and they would be afraid to commit even the most trivial
sin afterwards. But that they can perceive that God exists, and that righteousness and piety
are honourable, I also quite agree with you,’ said he.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The soul is not in its own nature immortal.</head>
<p>“ ‘These philosophers know nothing, then, about these things; for they cannot tell what
a soul is.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It does not appear so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Nor ought it to be called immortal; for if it is immortal, it is plainly unbegotten.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It is both unbegotten and immortal, according to some who are styled Platonists.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do you say that the world is also unbegotten?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Some say so. I do not, however, agree with them.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You are right; for what reason has one for supposing that a body so solid, possessing
resistance, composite, changeable, decaying, and renewed every day, has not arisen from
some cause? But if the world is begotten, souls also are necessarily begotten; and perhaps
at one time they were not in existence, for they were made on account of men and other
living creatures, if you will say that they have been begotten wholly apart, and not along
with their respective bodies.’</p>
<p>“ ‘This seems to be correct.’</p>
<p>“ ‘They are not, then, immortal?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No; since the world has appeared to us to be begotten.’</p>
<p>“ ‘But I do not say, indeed, that all souls die; for that were truly a piece of good fortune
to the evil. What then? The souls of the pious remain in a better place, while those of the
unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for the time of judgment. Thus some which have
appeared worthy of God never die; but others are punished so long as God wills them to
exist and to be punished.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Is what you say, then, of a like nature with that which Plato in Timæus hints about
the world, when he says that it is indeed subject to decay, inasmuch as it has been created,
but that it will neither be dissolved nor meet with the fate of death on account of the will of
God? Does it seem to you the very same can be said of the soul, and generally of all things?
For those things which exist after198 God, or shall at any time exist,199 these have the nature
of decay, and are such as may be blotted out and cease to exist; for God alone is unbegotten
and incorruptible, and therefore He is God, but all other things after Him are created and
corruptible. For this reason souls both die and are punished: since, if they were unbegotten,
they would neither sin, nor be filled with folly, nor be cowardly, and again ferocious; nor
would they willingly transform into swine, and serpents, and dogs; and it would not indeed
be just to compel them, if they be unbegotten. For that which is unbegotten is similar to,
equal to, and the same with that which is unbegotten; and neither in power nor in honour

should the one be preferred to the other, and hence there are not many things which are
unbegotten: for if there were some difference between them, you would not discover the
cause of the difference, though you searched for it; but after letting the mind ever wander
to infinity, you would at length, wearied out, take your stand on one Unbegotten, and say
that this is the Cause of all. Did such escape the observation of Plato and Pythagoras, those

<p>“ ‘It makes no matter to me,’ said he, ‘whether Plato or Pythagoras, or, in short, any
other man held such opinions. For the truth is so; and you would perceive it from this. The
soul assuredly is or has life. If, then, it is life, it would cause something else, and not itself,
to live, even as motion would move something else than itself. Now, that the soul lives, no
one would deny. But if it lives, it lives not as being life, but as the partaker of life; but that
which partakes of anything, is different from that of which it does partake. Now the soul
partakes of life, since God wills it to live. Thus, then, it will not even partake [of life] when
God does not will it to live. For to live is not its attribute, as it is God’s; but as a man does
not live always, and the soul is not for ever conjoined with the body, since, whenever this
harmony must be broken up, the soul leaves the body, and the man exists no longer; even
so, whenever the soul must cease to exist, the spirit of life is removed from it, and there is
no more soul, but it goes back to the place from whence it was taken.’</p>

<p>“ ‘There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are
esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit,
and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called
prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor
fearing any man, not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which
they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant,
and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end
of things, and of those matters which the philosopher ought to know, provided he has believed
them. For they did not use demonstration in their treatises, seeing that they were witnesses
to the truth above all demonstration, and worthy of belief; and those events which have
happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by
them, although, indeed, they were entitled to credit on account of the miracles which they
performed, since they both glorified the Creator, the God and Father of all things, and proclaimed
His Son, the Christ [sent] by Him: which, indeed, the false prophets, who are filled
with the lying unclean spirit, neither have done nor do, but venture to work certain wonderful
deeds for the purpose of astonishing men, and glorify the spirits and demons of error. But
pray that, above all things, the gates of light may be opened to you; for these things cannot

<head>Chapter VIII.—Justin by his colloquy is kindled with love to Christ.</head>
<p>“When he had spoken these and many other things, which there is no time for mentioning
at present, he went away, bidding me attend to them; and I have not seen him since. But
straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men
who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found
this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable. Thus, and for this reason, I am a philosopher.
Moreover, I would wish that all, making a resolution similar to my own, do not keep
themselves away from the words of the Saviour. For they possess a terrible power in themselves,
and are sufficient to inspire those who turn aside from the path of rectitude with
awe; while the sweetest rest is afforded those who make a diligent practice of them. If, then,
you have any concern for yourself, and if you are eagerly looking for salvation, and if you
believe in God, you may—since you are not indifferent to the matter200 —become acquainted
with the Christ of God, and, after being initiated,201 live a happy life.”</p>
<p>When I had said this, my beloved friends202 those who were with Trypho laughed; but
he, smiling, says, “I approve of your other remarks, and admire the eagerness with which
you study divine things; but it were better for you still to abide in the philosophy of Plato,
or of some other man, cultivating endurance, self-control, and moderation, rather than be
deceived by false words, and follow the opinions of men of no reputation. For if you remain
in that mode of philosophy, and live blamelessly, a hope of a better destiny were left to you;
but when you have forsaken God, and reposed confidence in man, what safety still awaits
you? If, then, you are willing to listen to me (for I have already considered you a friend),
first be circumcised, then observe what ordinances have been enacted with respect to the
Sabbath, and the feasts, and the new moons of God; and, in a word, do all things which
have been written in the law: and then perhaps you shall obtain mercy from God. But Christ
—if He has indeed been born, and exists anywhere—is unknown, and does not even know
Himself, and has no power until Elias come to anoint Him, and make Him manifest to all.
And you, having accepted a groundless report, invent a Christ for yourselves, and for his
sake are inconsiderately perishing.”</p>
<note type="footnote">200 According to one interpretation, this clause is applied to God: “If you believe in God, seeing He is not

Him, how we have not been deceived, and shall not cease to confess Him,—although men’s
reproaches be heaped upon us, although the most terrible tyrant compel us to deny Him,—I

any foundation but words filled with the Spirit of God, and big with power, and flourishing

<p>Then again those who were in his company laughed, and shouted in an unseemly
manner. Then I rose up and was about to leave; but he, taking hold of my garment, said I
should not accomplish that203 until I had performed what I promised. “Let not, then, your
companions be so tumultuous, or behave so disgracefully,” I said. “But if they wish, let them
listen in silence; or, if some better occupation prevent them, let them go away; while we,
having retired to some spot, and resting there, may finish the discourse.” It seemed good to
Trypho that we should do so; and accordingly, having agreed upon it, we retired to the
middle space of the Xystus. Two of his friends, when they had ridiculed and made game of
our zeal, went off. And when we were come to that place, where there are stone seats on
both sides, those with Trypho, having seated themselves on the one side, conversed with

observe sabbaths as you do? Are our lives and customs also slandered among you? And I

having extinguished the lights, we engage in promiscuous concubinage? Or do you condemn
us in this alone, that we adhere to such tenets, and believe in an opinion, untrue, as you
think?”</p>
<p>“This is what we are amazed at,” said Trypho, “but those things about which the multitude
speak are not worthy of belief; for they are most repugnant to human nature. Moreover,
I am aware that your precepts in the so-called Gospel are so wonderful and so great, that I
suspect no one can keep them; for I have carefully read them. But this is what we are most

are not in any particular separated from them, and do not alter your mode of living from
the nations, in that you observe no festivals or sabbaths, and do not have the rite of circumcision;
and further, resting your hopes on a man that was crucified, you yet expect to obtain
some good thing from God, while you do not obey His commandments. Have you not read,
that that soul shall be cut off from his people who shall not have been circumcised on the
eighth day? And this has been ordained for strangers and for slaves equally. But you, despising
this covenant rashly, reject the consequent duties, and attempt to persuade yourselves that
you know God, when, however, you perform none of those things which they do who fear
God. If, therefore, you can defend yourself on these points, and make it manifest in what
way you hope for anything whatsoever, even though you do not observe the law, this we
would very gladly hear from you, and we shall make other similar investigations.”</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The law abrogated; the New Testament promised and given by
God.</head>
<p>“There will be no other God, O Trypho, nor was there from eternity any other existing”
(I thus addressed him), “but He who made and disposed all this universe. Nor do we think
that there is one God for us, another for you, but that He alone is God who led your fathers
out from Egypt with a strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for
there is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the God of Abraham, and of
Isaac, and of Jacob. But we do not trust through Moses or through the law; for then we
would do the same as yourselves. But now204—(for I have read that there shall be a final
law, and a covenant, the chiefest of all, which it is now incumbent on all men to observe,
as many as are seeking after the inheritance of God. For the law promulgated on Horeb is
now old, and belongs to yourselves alone; but this is for all universally. Now, law placed
against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant which comes after in like
manner has put an end to the previous one; and an eternal and final law—namely, Christ
—has been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law,
no commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says: ‘Hearken unto
Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, ye kings, give ear unto Me: for a law shall go forth
from Me, and My judgment shall be for a light to the nations. My righteousness approaches
swiftly, and My salvation shall go forth, and nations shall trust in Mine arm?’205 And by
Jeremiah, concerning this same new covenant, He thus speaks: ‘Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of
Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt’206). If, therefore, God proclaimed
a new covenant which was to be instituted, and this for a light of the nations, we see and are
persuaded that men approach God, leaving their idols and other unrighteousness, through
the name of Him who was crucified, Jesus Christ, and abide by their confession even unto
death, and maintain piety. Moreover, by the works and by the attendant miracles, it is possible
for all to understand that He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of
those who out of every people wait for the good things of God. For the true spiritual Israel,
and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham (who in uncircumcision was approved
of and blessed by God on account of his faith, and called the father of many nations), are

<p>I also adduced another passage in which Isaiah exclaims: “ ‘Hear My words, and your
soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of
David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people: nations which know not Thee
shall call on Thee; peoples who know not Thee shall escape to Thee, because of thy God,
the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified Thee.’207 This same law you have despised, and
His new holy covenant you have slighted; and now you neither receive it, nor repent of your
evil deeds. ‘For your ears are closed, your eyes are blinded, and the heart is hardened,’
Jeremiah208 has cried; yet not even then do you listen. The Lawgiver is present, yet you do
not see Him; to the poor the Gospel is preached, the blind see, yet you do not understand.
You have now need of a second circumcision, though you glory greatly in the flesh. The
new law requires you to keep perpetual sabbath, and you, because you are idle for one day,
suppose you are pious, not discerning why this has been commanded you: and if you eat
unleavened bread, you say the will of God has been fulfilled. The Lord our God does not
take pleasure in such observances: if there is any perjured person or a thief among you, let
him cease to be so; if any adulterer, let him repent; then he has kept the sweet and true sabbaths
of God. If any one has impure hands, let him wash and be pure.</p>

<p>“For Isaiah did not send you to a bath, there to wash away murder and other sins, which
not even all the water of the sea were sufficient to purge; but, as might have been expected,
this was that saving bath of the olden time which followed209 those who repented, and who
no longer were purified by the blood of goats and of sheep, or by the ashes of an heifer, or
by the offerings of fine flour, but by faith through the blood of Christ, and through His
death, who died for this very reason, as Isaiah himself said, when he spake thus: ‘The Lord
shall make bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the nations and the ends
of the earth shall see the salvation of God. Depart ye, depart ye, depart ye,210 go ye out from
thence, and touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her, be ye clean that bear the
vessels of the Lord, for211 ye go not with haste. For the Lord shall go before you; and the
Lord, the God of Israel, shall gather you together. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently;
and He shall be exalted, and be greatly glorified. As many were astonished at Thee, so Thy
form and Thy glory shall be marred more than men. So shall many nations be astonished
at Him, and the kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them con-
cerning Him shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they consider. Lord,
who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have announced
Him as a child before Him, as a root in a dry ground. He hath no form or comeliness,
and when we saw Him He had no form or beauty; but His form is dishonoured, and
fails more than the sons of men. He is a man in affliction, and acquainted with bearing
sickness, because His face has been turned away; He was despised, and we esteemed Him
not. He bears our sins, and is distressed for us; and we esteemed Him to be in toil and in
affliction, and in evil treatment. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised
for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him. With His stripes we are
healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray. Every man has turned to his own way; and the
Lord laid on Him our iniquities, and by reason of His oppression He opens not His mouth.
He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so
He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. And who
shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth. Because of the transgressions
of my people He came unto death. And I will give the wicked for His grave, and the rich for
His death, because He committed no iniquity, and deceit was not found in His mouth. And
the Lord wills to purify Him from affliction. If he has been given for sin, your soul shall see
a long-lived seed. And the Lord wills to take His soul away from trouble, to show Him light,
and to form Him in understanding, to justify the righteous One who serves many well. And

Gentiles, and thou shalt make the desolate cities to be inherited. Fear not because thou art

<head>Chapter XIV.—Righteousness is not placed in Jewish rites, but in the conversion
of the heart given in baptism by Christ.</head>
<p>“By reason, therefore, of this laver of repentance and knowledge of God, which has been
ordained on account of the transgression of God’s people, as Isaiah cries, we have believed,
and testify that that very baptism which he announced is alone able to purify those who
have repented; and this is the water of life. But the cisterns which you have dug for yourselves
are broken and profitless to you. For what is the use of that baptism which cleanses the flesh
and body alone? Baptize the soul from wrath and from covetousness, from envy, and from
hatred; and, lo! the body is pure. For this is the symbolic significance of unleavened bread,
that you do not commit the old deeds of wicked leaven. But you have understood all things
in a carnal sense, and you suppose it to be piety if you do such things, while your souls are
filled with deceit, and, in short, with every wickedness. Accordingly, also, after the seven
days of eating unleavened bread, God commanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the
performance of other works, and not the imitation of the old and evil works. And because
this is what this new Lawgiver demands of you, I shall again refer to the words which have
been quoted by me, and to others also which have been passed over. They are related by
Isaiah to the following effect: ‘Hearken to me, and your soul shall live; and I will make with
you an everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for
a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the nations. Nations which know not
Thee shall call on Thee; and peoples who know not Thee shall escape unto Thee, because
of Thy God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified Thee. Seek ye God; and when you
find Him, call on Him, so long as He may be nigh you. Let the wicked forsake his ways, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will obtain
mercy, because He will abundantly pardon your sins. For my thoughts are not as your
thoughts, neither are my ways as your ways; but as far removed as the heavens are from the
earth, so far is my way removed from your way, and your thoughts from my thoughts. For
as the snow or the rain descends from heaven, and shall not return till it waters the earth,
and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall
My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return until it shall have accomplished
all that I desired, and I shall make My commandments prosperous. For ye shall go
out with joy, and be taught with gladness. For the mountains and the hills shall leap while
they expect you, and all the trees of the fields shall applaud with their branches: and instead
of the thorn shall come up the cypress, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle.
And the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and He shall not fail!’215 Of
these and such like words written by the prophets, O Trypho,” said I, “some have reference
to the first advent of Christ, in which He is preached as inglorious, obscure, and of mortal

<head>Chapter XV.—In what the true fasting consists</head>
<p>“Learn, therefore, to keep the true fast of God, as Isaiah says, that you may please God.
Isaiah has cried thus: ‘Shout vehemently, and do not spare: lift up thy voice as with a trumpet,
and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. They seek Me
from day to day, and desire to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook
not the judgment of God. They ask of Me now righteous judgment, and desire to draw near
to God, saying, Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not? and afflicted our souls, and
Thou hast not known? Because in the days of your fasting you find your own pleasure, and
oppress all those who are subject to you. Behold, ye fast for strifes and debates, and smite
the humble with your fists. Why do ye fast for Me, as to-day, so that your voice is heard
aloud? This is not the fast which I have chosen, the day in which a man shall afflict his soul.
And not even if you bend your neck like a ring, or clothe yourself in sackcloth and ashes,
shall you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord. This is not the fast which I have
chosen, saith the Lord; but loose every unrighteous bond, dissolve the terms of wrongous
covenants, let the oppressed go free, and avoid every iniquitous contract. Deal thy bread to
the hungry, and lead the homeless poor under thy dwelling; if thou seest the naked, clothe
him; and do not hide thyself from thine own flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as the
morning, and thy garments216 shall rise up quickly: and thy righteousness shall go before
thee, and the glory of God shall envelope thee. Then shalt thou cry, and the Lord shall hear
thee: while thou art speaking, He will say, Behold, I am here. And if thou take away from
thee the yoke, and the stretching out of the hand, and the word of murmuring; and shalt
give heartily thy bread to the hungry, and shalt satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light
arise in the darkness, and thy darkness shall be as the noon-day: and thy God shall be with
thee continually, and thou shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desireth, and thy bones
shall become fat, and shall be as a watered garden, and as a fountain of water, or as a land
where water fails not.’217 ‘Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart,’ as the words
of God in all these passages demand.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Circumcision given as a sign, that the Jews might be driven away
for their evil deeds done to Christ and the Christians.</head>
<p>“And God himself proclaimed by Moses, speaking thus: ‘And circumcise the hardness
of your hearts, and no longer stiffen the neck. For the Lord your God is both Lord of lords,
and a great, mighty, and terrible God, who regardeth not persons, and taketh not rewards.’218
And in Leviticus: ‘Because they have transgressed against Me, and despised Me, and because
they have walked contrary to Me, I also walked contrary to them, and I shall cut them off
in the land of their enemies. Then shall their uncircumcised heart be turned.219 For the
circumcision according to the flesh, which is from Abraham, was given for a sign; that you
may be separated from other nations, and from us; and that you alone may suffer that which
you now justly suffer; and that your land may be desolate, and your cities burned with fire;
and that strangers may eat your fruit in your presence, and not one of you may go up to
Jerusalem.’220 For you are not recognised among the rest of men by any other mark than
your fleshly circumcision. For none of you, I suppose, will venture to say that God neither
did nor does foresee the events, which are future, nor foreordained his deserts for each one.
Accordingly, these things have happened to you in fairness and justice, for you have slain
the Just One, and His prophets before Him; and now you reject those who hope in Him,
and in Him who sent Him—God the Almighty and Maker of all things —cursing in your
synagogues those that believe on Christ. For you have not the power to lay hands upon us,
on account of those who now have the mastery. But as often as you could, you did so.
Wherefore God, by Isaiah, calls to you, saying, ‘Behold how the righteous man perished,
and no one regards it. For the righteous man is taken away from before iniquity. His grave
shall be in peace, he is taken away from the midst. Draw near hither, ye lawless children,
seed of the adulterers, and children of the whore. Against whom have you sported yourselves,

as you have, who in very deed are the authors of the wicked prejudice against the Just One,
and us who hold by Him. For after that you had crucified Him, the only blameless and
righteous Man,— through whose stripes those who approach the Father by Him are healed,
—when you knew that He had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven, as the prophets
foretold He would, you not only did not repent of the wickedness which you had committed,
but at that time you selected and sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the land
to tell that the godless heresy of the Christians had sprung up, and to publish those things
which all they who knew us not speak against us. So that you are the cause not only of your
own unrighteousness, but in fact of that of all other men. And Isaiah cries justly: ‘By reason
of you, My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles.’222 And: ‘Woe unto their soul! because
they have devised an evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind the righteous, for
he is distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked!
evil shall be rendered to him according to the works of his hands.’ And again, in other
words:223 ‘Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and their transgressions
as with the harness of a heifer’s yoke: who say, Let his speed come near; and let the
counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. Woe unto them that call evil
good, and good evil; that put light for darkness, and darkness for light; that put bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter!’224 Accordingly, you displayed great zeal in publishing
throughout all the land bitter and dark and unjust things against the only blameless and
righteous Light sent by God.</p>
<p>For He appeared distasteful to you when He cried among you, ‘It is written, My house
is the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves!’225 He overthrew also the tables
of the money-changers in the temple, and exclaimed, ‘Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye pay tithe of mint and rue, but do not observe the love of God and
justice. Ye whited sepulchres! appearing beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s

circumcision. For we too would observe the fleshly circumcision, and the Sabbaths, and in
short all the feasts, if we did not know for what reason they were enjoined you,—namely,
on account of your transgressions and the hardness of your hearts. For if we patiently endure
all things contrived against us by wicked men and demons, so that even amid cruelties unutterable,
death and torments, we pray for mercy to those who inflict such things upon us,
and do not wish to give the least retort to any one, even as the new Lawgiver commanded

Moses on account of the hardness of their hearts.</head>
<p>“It is this about which we are at a loss, and with reason, because, while you endure such
things, you do not observe all the other customs which we are now discussing.”</p>
<p>“This circumcision is not, however, necessary for all men, but for you alone, in order
that, as I have already said, you may suffer these things which you now justly suffer. Nor do
we receive that useless baptism of cisterns, for it has nothing to do with this baptism of life.
Wherefore also God has announced that you have forsaken Him, the living fountain, and
digged for yourselves broken cisterns which can hold no water. Even you, who are the circumcised
according to the flesh, have need of our circumcision; but we, having the latter,
do not require the former. For if it were necessary, as you suppose, God would not have
made Adam uncircumcised; would not have had respect to the gifts of Abel when, being
uncircumcised, he offered sacrifice, and would not have been pleased with the uncircumcision
of Enoch, who was not found, because God had translated him. Lot, being uncircumcised,
was saved from Sodom, the angels themselves and the Lord sending him out. Noah was the
beginning of our race; yet, uncircumcised, along with his children he went into the ark.
Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High, was uncircumcised; to whom also Abraham the
first who received circumcision after the flesh, gave tithes, and he blessed him: after whose
order God declared, by the mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting priest.
Therefore to you alone this circumcision was necessary, in order that the people may be no
people, and the nation no nation; as also Hosea,227 one of the twelve prophets, declares.
Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned, though they kept no Sabbaths,228
were pleasing to God; and after them Abraham with all his descendants until Moses, under
whom your nation appeared unrighteous and ungrateful to God, making a calf in the wilderness:
wherefore God, accommodating Himself to that nation, enjoined them also to offer
sacrifices, as if to His name, in order that you might not serve idols. Which precept, however,
you have not observed; nay, you sacrificed your children to demons. And you were commanded
to keep Sabbaths, that you might retain the memorial of God. For His word makes

<p>“Moreover, you were commanded to abstain from certain kinds of food, in order that
you might keep God before your eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that you were prone
and very ready to depart from His knowledge, as Moses also affirms: ‘The people ate and
drank, and rose up to play.’230 And again: ‘Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and waxed fat; and
he who was beloved kicked: he waxed fat, he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he forsook
God who had made him.’231 For it was told you by Moses in the book of Genesis, that God
granted to Noah, being a just man, to eat of every animal, but not of flesh with the blood,
which is dead.”232 And as he was ready to say, “as the green herbs,” I anticipated him: “Why
do you not receive this statement, ‘as the green herbs,’ in the sense in which it was given by
God, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to man, even so has He
given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a distinction was laid down thereafter
to Noah, because we do not eat certain herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible.
And first I shall not occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that every vegetable
is food, and fit to be eaten. But although we discriminate between green herbs, not
eating all, we refrain from eating some, not because they are common or unclean, but because
they are bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take of all herbs which are
sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine or land plants. Thus also God by
the mouth of Moses commanded you to abstain from unclean and improper233 and violent
animals: when, moreover, though you were eating manna in the desert, and were seeing all
those wondrous acts wrought for you by God, you made and worshipped the golden calf.234
Hence he cries continually, and justly, ‘They are foolish children, in whom is no faith.’235</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Sabbaths were instituted on account of the people’s sins, and not
for a work of righteousness.</head>
<p>“Moreover, that God enjoined you to keep the Sabbath, and impose on you other precepts
for a sign, as I have already said, on account of your unrighteousness, and that of your
fathers,—as He declares that for the sake of the nations, lest His name be profaned among
them, therefore He permitted some of you to remain alive,—these words of His can prove
to you: they are narrated by Ezekiel thus: ‘I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and
keep My judgments, and take no part in the customs of Egypt; and hallow My Sabbaths;
and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your
God. Notwithstanding ye rebelled against Me, and your children walked not in My statutes,
neither kept My judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shall live in them. But they
polluted My Sabbaths. And I said that I would pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness,
to accomplish My anger upon them; yet I did it not; that My name might not be altogether
profaned in the sight of the heathen. I led them out before their eyes, and I lifted up Mine
hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse
them through the countries; because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised
My statutes, and polluted My Sabbaths, and their eyes were after the devices of their fathers.
Wherefore I gave them also statutes which were not good, and judgments whereby they
shall not live. And I shall pollute them in their own gifts, that I may destroy all that openeth
the womb, when I pass through them.’236</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—So also were sacrifices and oblations.</head>
<p>“And that you may learn that it was for the sins of your own nation, and for their idolatries
and not because there was any necessity for such sacrifices, that they were likewise
enjoined, listen to the manner in which He speaks of these by Amos, one of the twelve,
saying: ‘Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is this day of the Lord
for you? It is darkness and not light, as when a man flees from the face of a lion, and a bear
meets him; and he goes into his house, and leans his hands against the wall, and the serpent
bites him. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light, even very dark, and no
brightness in it? I have hated, I have despised your feast-days, and I will not smell in your
solemn assemblies: wherefore, though ye offer Me your burnt-offerings and sacrifices, I will
not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your presence. Take thou away
from Me the multitude of thy songs and psalms; I will not hear thine instruments. But let
judgment be rolled down as water, and righteousness as an impassable torrent. Have ye
offered unto Me victims and sacrifices in the wilderness, O house of Israel? saith the Lord.
And have ye taken up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Raphan, the figures
which ye made for yourselves? And I will carry you away beyond Damascus, saith the Lord,
whose name is the Almighty God. Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
mountain of Samaria: those who are named among the chiefs have plucked away the firstfruits
of the nations: the house of Israel have entered for themselves. Pass all of you unto
Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye unto Hamath the great, and go down thence to Gath
of the strangers, the noblest of all these kingdoms, if their boundaries are greater than your
boundaries. Ye who come to the evil day, who are approaching, and who hold to false Sabbaths;
who lie on beds of ivory, and are at ease upon their couches; who eat the lambs out
of the flock, and the sucking calves out of the midst of the herd; who applaud at the sound
of the musical instruments; they reckon them as stable, and not as fleeting, who drink wine
in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not grieved for the
affliction of Joseph. Wherefore now they shall be captives, among the first of the nobles who
are carried away; and the house of evil-doers shall be removed, and the neighing of horses
shall be taken away from Ephraim.’237 And again by Jeremiah: ‘Collect your flesh, and sacrifices,
and eat: for concerning neither sacrifices nor libations did I command your fathers
in the day in which I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt.’238 And again by
David, in the forty-ninth Psalm, He thus said: ‘The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken, and
called the earth, from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion is the
perfection of His beauty. God, even our God, shall come openly, and shall not keep silence.
Fire shall burn before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call

to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people. Assemble to Him His
saints; those that have made a covenant with Him by sacrifices. And the heavens shall declare
His righteousness, for God is judge. Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee; O Israel,
and I will testify to thee, I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;
thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. I will take no bullocks out of thy house, nor
he-goats out of thy folds: for all the beasts of the field are Mine, the herds and the oxen on
the mountains. I know all the fowls of the heavens, and the beauty of the field is Mine. If I
were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof. Will I eat
the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and
pay thy vows unto the Most High, and call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
declare My statutes, and to take My covenant into thy mouth? But thou hast hated instruction,
and cast My words behind thee. When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him; and
hast been partaker with the adulterer. Thy mouth has framed evil, and thy tongue has enfolded
deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s
son. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I would be like
thyself in wickedness. I will reprove thee, and set thy sins in order before thine eyes. Now
consider this, ye that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me; and there is the way in which I shall show him My
salvation.’239 Accordingly He neither takes sacrifices from you nor commanded them at
first to be offered because they are needful to Him, but because of your sins. For indeed the
temple, which is called the temple in Jerusalem, He admitted to be His house or court, not
as though He needed it, but in order that you, in this view of it, giving yourselves to Him,
might not worship idols. And that this is so, Isaiah says: ‘What house have ye built Me? saith
the Lord. Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.’240</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The opinion of the Jews regarding the law does an injury to
God.</head>
<p>“But if we do not admit this, we shall be liable to fall into foolish opinions, as if it were
not the same God who existed in the times of Enoch and all the rest, who neither were circumcised
after the flesh, nor observed Sabbaths, nor any other rites, seeing that Moses enjoined
such observances; or that God has not wished each race of mankind continually to
perform the same righteous actions: to admit which, seems to be ridiculous and absurd.
Therefore we must confess that He, who is ever the same, has commanded these and such
like institutions on account of sinful men, and we must declare Him to be benevolent,
foreknowing, needing nothing, righteous and good. But if this be not so, tell me, sir, what
you think of those matters which we are investigating.” And when no one responded:
“Wherefore, Trypho, I will proclaim to you, and to those who wish to become proselytes,
the divine message which I heard from that man.241 Do you see that the elements are not
idle, and keep no Sabbaths? Remain as you were born. For if there was no need of circumcision
before Abraham, or of the observance of Sabbaths, of feasts and sacrifices, before
Moses; no more need is there of them now, after that, according to the will of God, Jesus
Christ the Son of God has been born without sin, of a virgin sprung from the stock of Abraham.
For when Abraham himself was in uncircumcision, he was justified and blessed by
reason of the faith which he reposed in God, as the Scripture tells. Moreover, the Scriptures
and the facts themselves compel us to admit that He received circumcision for a sign, and
not for righteousness. So that it was justly recorded concerning the people, that the soul
which shall not be circumcised on the eighth day shall be cut off from his family. And, furthermore,
the inability of the female sex to receive fleshly circumcision, proves that this
circumcision has been given for a sign, and not for a work of righteousness. For God has
given likewise to women the ability to observe all things which are righteous and virtuous;
but we see that the bodily form of the male has been made different from the bodily form
of the female; yet we know that neither of them is righteous or unrighteous merely for this
cause, but [is considered righteous] by reason of piety and righteousness.</p>

<p>“Now, sirs,” I said, “it is possible for us to show how the eighth day possessed a certain
mysterious import, which the seventh day did not possess, and which was promulgated by
God through these rites. But lest I appear now to diverge to other subjects, understand what
I say: the blood of that circumcision is obsolete, and we trust in the blood of salvation; there
is now another covenant, and another law has gone forth from Zion. Jesus Christ circumcises
all who will—as was declared above —with knives of stone;242 that they may be a righteous
nation, a people keeping faith, holding to the truth, and maintaining peace. Come then with
me, all who fear God, who wish to see the good of Jerusalem. Come, let us go to the light of
the Lord; for He has liberated His people, the house of Jacob. Come, all nations; let us
gather ourselves together at Jerusalem, no longer plagued by war for the sins of her people.

which walked in a way that was not good, but after their own sins. It is a people that provoketh

<p>“Those who justify themselves, and say they are sons of Abraham, shall be desirous even
in a small degree to receive the inheritance along with you;245 as the Holy Spirit, by the
mouth of Isaiah, cries, speaking thus while he personates them: ‘Return from heaven, and
behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and glory. Where is Thy zeal and strength?
Where is the multitude of Thy mercy? for Thou hast sustained us, O Lord. For Thou art
our Father, because Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel has not recognised us. But Thou,
O Lord, our Father, deliver us: from the beginning Thy name is upon us. O Lord, why hast
Thou made us to err from Thy way? and hardened our hearts, so that we do not fear Thee?
Return for Thy servants’ sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we may inherit for a little
Thy holy mountain. We were as from the beginning, when Thou didst not bear rule over
us, and when Thy name was not called upon us. If Thou wilt open the heavens, trembling
shall seize the mountains before Thee: and they shall be melted, as wax melts before the fire;
and fire shall consume the adversaries, and Thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries;
the nations shall be put into disorder before Thy face. When Thou shalt do glorious
things, trembling shall seize the mountains before Thee. From the beginning we have not
heard, nor have our eyes seen a God besides Thee: and Thy works,246 the mercy which Thou
shall show to those who repent. He shall meet those who do righteousness, and they shall
remember Thy ways. Behold, Thou art wroth, and we were sinning. Therefore we have erred
and become all unclean, and all our righteousness is as the rags of a woman set apart: and
we have faded away like leaves by reason of our iniquities; thus the wind will take us away.
And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, or remembers to take hold of Thee; for Thou
hast turned away Thy face from us, and hast given us up on account of our sins. And now
return, O Lord, for we are all Thy people. The city of Thy holiness has become desolate.
Zion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse; the house, our holiness, and the glory
which our fathers blessed, has been burned with fire; and all the glorious nations247 have
fallen along with it. And in addition to these [misfortunes], O Lord, Thou hast refrained

<p>And I replied, “I do not say so; but those who have persecuted and do persecute Christ,
if they do not repent, shall not inherit anything on the holy mountain. But the Gentiles, who
have believed on Him, and have repented of the sins which they have committed, they shall
receive the inheritance along with the patriarchs and the prophets, and the just men who
are descended from Jacob, even although they neither keep the Sabbath, nor are circumcised,
nor observe the feasts. Assuredly they shall receive the holy inheritance of God. For God
speaks by Isaiah thus: ‘I, the Lord God, have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold
Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant of the people,
for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound
from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house.’249 And again: ‘Lift
up a standard250 for the people; for, lo, the Lord has made it heard unto the end of the earth.
Say ye to the daughters of Zion, Behold, thy Saviour has come; having His reward, and His
work before His face: and He shall call it a holy nation, redeemed by the Lord. And thou
shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken. Who is this that cometh from Edom? in
red garments from Bosor? This that is beautiful in apparel, going up with great strength? I
speak righteousness, and the judgment of salvation. Why are Thy garments red, and Thine
apparel as from the trodden wine-press? Thou art full of the trodden grape. I have trodden
the wine-press all alone, and of the people there is no man with Me; and I have trampled
them in fury, and crushed them to the ground, and spilled their blood on the earth. For the
day of retribution has come upon them, and the year of redemption is present. And I looked,

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Why God taught the same things by the prophets as by Moses.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “Why do you select and quote whatever you wish from the prophetic
writings, but do not refer to those which expressly command the Sabbath to be observed?
For Isaiah thus speaks: ‘If thou shalt turn away thy foot from the Sabbaths, so as not to do
thy pleasure on the holy day, and shalt call the Sabbaths the holy delights of thy God; if thou
shalt not lift thy foot to work, and shalt not speak a word from thine own mouth; then thou
shalt trust in the Lord, and He shall cause thee to go up to the good things of the land; and
He shall feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.’ ”252</p>
<p>And I replied, “I have passed them by, my friends, not because such prophecies were
contrary to me, but because you have understood, and do understand, that although God
commands you by all the prophets to do the same things which He also commanded by
Moses, it was on account of the hardness of your hearts, and your ingratitude towards Him,
that He continually proclaims them, in order that, even in this way, if you repented, you
might please Him, and neither sacrifice your children to demons, nor be partakers with
thieves, nor lovers of gifts, nor hunters after revenge, nor fail in doing judgment for orphans,
nor be inattentive to the justice due to the widow, nor have your hands full of blood. ‘For
the daughters of Zion have walked with a high neck, both sporting by winking with their
eyes, and sweeping along their dresses.253 For they are all gone aside,’ He exclaims, ‘they
are all become useless. There is none that understands, there is not so much as one. With
their tongues they have practised deceit, their throat is an open sepulchre, the poison of
asps is under their lips, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the way of peace they
have not known.’254 So that, as in the beginning, these things were enjoined you because of
your wickedness, in like manner because of your stedfastness in it, or rather your increased
proneness to it, by means of the same precepts He calls you to a remembrance or knowledge
of it. But you are a people hard-hearted and without understanding, both blind and lame,
children in whom is no faith, as He Himself says, honouring Him only with your lips, far
from Him in your hearts, teaching doctrines that are your own and not His. For, tell me,
did God wish the priests to sin when they offer the sacrifices on the Sabbaths? or those to
sin, who are circumcised and do circumcise on the Sabbaths; since He commands that on
the eighth day—even though it happen to be a Sabbath— those who are born shall be always
circumcised? or could not the infants be operated upon one day previous or one day subsequent
to the Sabbath, if He knew that it is a sinful act upon the Sabbaths? Or why did He
not teach those—who are called righteous and pleasing to Him, who lived before Moses

have given it attention: for, to tell the truth, it is worthy of attention; and that answer which
pleases most —namely, that so it seemed good to Him—does not satisfy me. For this is ever
the shift to which those have recourse who are unable to answer the question.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “Since I bring from the Scriptures and the facts themselves both the proofs
and the inculcation of them, do not delay or hesitate to put faith in me, although I am an
uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to become proselytes. If Christ’s
coming shall have anticipated you, in vain you will repent, in vain you will weep; for He will
not hear you. ‘Break up your fallow ground,’ Jeremiah has cried to the people, ‘and sow not
among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and circumcise the foreskin of your
heart.’255 Do not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can
have no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and fat, is in your
hearts. ‘For, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will visit all them that are circumcised
in their foreskins; Egypt, and Judah,256 and Edom, and the sons of Moab. For all the
nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts.’257
Do you see how that God does not mean this circumcision which is given for a sign? For it
is of no use to the Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a man
be a Scythian or a Persian, if he has the knowledge of God and of His Christ, and keeps the
everlasting righteous decrees, he is circumcised with the good and useful circumcision, and
is a friend of God, and God rejoices in his gifts and offerings. But I will lay before you, my
friends, the very words of God, when He said to the people by Malachi, one of the twelve
prophets, ‘I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; and I shall not accept your sacrifices at
your hands: for from the rising of the sun unto its setting My name shall be glorified among
the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto My name, even a pure sacrifice:
for My name is honoured among the Gentiles, saith the Lord; but ye profane it.’258 And by
David He said, ‘A people whom I have not known, served Me; at the hearing of the ear they
obeyed Me.’259</p>

have I of circumcision, who have been witnessed to by God? What need have I of that other
baptism, who have been baptized with the Holy Ghost? I think that while I mention this, I
would persuade even those who are possessed of scanty intelligence. For these words have
neither been prepared by me, nor embellished by the art of man; but David sung them,
Isaiah preached them, Zechariah proclaimed them, and Moses wrote them. Are you acquainted
with them, Trypho? They are contained in your Scriptures, or rather not yours, but
ours.260 For we believe them; but you, though you read them, do not catch the spirit that is
in them. Be not offended at, or reproach us with, the bodily uncircumcision with which
God has created us; and think it not strange that we drink hot water on the Sabbaths, since
God directs the government of the universe on this day equally as on all others; and the
priests, as on other days, so on this, are ordered to offer sacrifices; and there are so many
righteous men who have performed none of these legal ceremonies, and yet are witnessed
to by God Himself.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Christians possess the true righteousness.</head>
<p>“But impute it to your own wickedness, that God even can be accused by those who

For such institutions seemed to be unreasonable and unworthy of God to many men, who
had not received grace to know that your nation were called to conversion and repentance
of spirit,261 while they were in a sinful condition and labouring under spiritual disease; and
that the prophecy which was announced subsequent to the death of Moses is everlasting.
And this is mentioned in the Psalm, my friends.262 And that we, who have been made wise
by them, confess that the statutes of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honey-comb,
is manifest from the fact that, though threatened with death, we do not deny His name.
Moreover, it is also manifest to all, that we who believe in Him pray to be kept by Him from
strange, i.e., from wicked and deceitful, spirits; as the word of prophecy, personating one
of those who believe in Him, figuratively declares. For we do continually beseech God by
Jesus Christ to preserve us from the demons which are hostile to the worship of God, and
whom we of old time served, in order that, after our conversion by Him to God, we may be
blameless. For we call Him Helper and Redeemer, the power of whose name even the demons
do fear; and at this day, when they are exorcised in the name of Jesus Christ, crucified under
Pontius Pilate, governor of Judæa, they are overcome. And thus it is manifest to all, that His
Father has given Him so great power, by virtue of which demons are subdued to His name,
and to the dispensation of His suffering.</p>

of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow His glorious advent! For
He shall come on the clouds as the Son of man, so Daniel foretold, and His angels shall come
with Him. These are the words: ‘I beheld till the thrones were set; and the Ancient of days
did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His
throne was like a fiery flame, His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came
forth from before Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand stood before Him. The books were opened, and the judgment was set. I beheld
then the voice of the great words which the horn speaks: and the beast was beat down, and
his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. And the rest of the beasts were taken
away from their dominion, and a period of life was given to the beasts until a season and
time. I saw in the vision of the night, and, behold, one like the Son of man coming with the
clouds of heaven; and He came to the Ancient of days, and stood before Him. And they who
stood by brought Him near; and there were given Him power and kingly honour, and all
nations of the earth by their families, and all glory, serve Him. And His dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which shall not be taken away; and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.
And my spirit was chilled within my frame, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came
near unto one of them that stood by, and inquired the precise meaning of all these things.
In answer he speaks to me, and showed me the judgment of the matters: These great beasts
are four kingdoms, which shall perish from the earth, and shall not receive dominion for
ever, even for ever and ever. Then I wished to know exactly about the fourth beast, which
destroyed all [the others] and was very terrible, its teeth of iron, and its nails of brass; which
devoured, made waste, and stamped the residue with its feet: also about the ten horns upon
its head, and of the one which came up, by means of which three of the former fell. And
that horn had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things; and its countenance excelled the
rest. And I beheld that horn waging war against the saints, and prevailing against them,
until the Ancient of days came; and He gave judgment for the saints of the Most High. And
the time came, and the saints of the Most High possessed the kingdom. And it was told me
concerning the fourth beast: There shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall prevail
over all these kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall destroy and make it
thoroughly waste. And the ten horns are ten kings that shall arise; and one shall arise after
them;263 and he shall surpass the first in evil deeds, and he shall subdue three kings, and he
shall speak words against the Most High, and shall overthrow the rest of the saints of the
Most High, and shall expect to change the seasons and the times. And it shall be delivered

into his hands for a time, and times, and half a time. And the judgment sat, and they shall
take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom, and
the power, and the great places of the kingdoms under the heavens, were given to the holy
people of the Most High, to reign in an everlasting kingdom: and all powers shall be subject
to Him, and shall obey Him. Hitherto is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was possessed with
a very great astonishment, and my speech was changed in me; yet I kept the matter in my

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Trypho objecting that Christ is described as glorious by Daniel,
Justin distinguishes two advents.</head>
<p>And when I had ceased, Trypho said, “These and such like Scriptures, sir, compel us to
wait for Him who, as Son of man, receives from the Ancient of days the everlasting kingdom.
But this so-called Christ of yours was dishonourable and inglorious, so much so that the
last curse contained in the law of God fell on him, for he was crucified.”</p>
<p>Then I replied to him, “If, sirs, it were not said by the Scriptures which I have already
quoted, that His form was inglorious, and His generation not declared, and that for His
death the rich would suffer death, and with His stripes we should be healed, and that He
would be led away like a sheep; and if I had not explained that there would be two advents
of His,—one in which He was pierced by you; a second, when you shall know Him whom
you have pierced, and your tribes shall mourn, each tribe by itself, the women apart, and
the men apart,—then I must have been speaking dubious and obscure things. But now, by
means of the contents of those Scriptures esteemed holy and prophetic amongst you, I attempt
to prove all [that I have adduced], in the hope that some one of you may be found to be of
that remnant which has been left by the grace of the Lord of Sabaoth for the eternal salvation.
In order, therefore, that the matter inquired into may be plainer to you, I will mention to
you other words also spoken by the blessed David, from which you will perceive that the
Lord is called the Christ by the Holy Spirit of prophecy; and that the Lord, the Father of all,
has brought Him again from the earth, setting Him at His own right hand, until He makes
His enemies His footstool; which indeed happens from the time that our Lord Jesus Christ
ascended to heaven, after He rose again from the dead, the times now running on to their
consummation; and he whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time, and times,
and an half, is even already at the door, about to speak blasphemous and daring things
against the Most High. But you, being ignorant of how long he will have dominion, hold
another opinion. For you interpret the ‘time’ as being a hundred years. But if this is so, the
man of sin must, at the shortest, reign three hundred and fifty years, in order that we may
compute that which is said by the holy Daniel— ‘and times’—to be two times only. All this
I have said to you in digression, in order that you at length may be persuaded of what has
been declared against you by God, that you are foolish sons; and of this, ‘Therefore, behold,
I will proceed to take away this people, and shall take them away; and I will strip the wise
of their wisdom, and will hide the understanding of their prudent men;’265 and may cease
to deceive yourselves and those who hear you, and may learn of us, who have been taught
wisdom by the grace of Christ. The words, then, which were spoken by David, are these:266
‘The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy

footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of Thy strength out of Sion: rule Thou also in the
midst of Thine enemies. With Thee shall be, in the day, the chief of Thy power, in the
beauties of Thy saints. From the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten Thee. The
Lord hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord is at Thy right hand: He has crushed kings in the day of His wrath: He shall judge
among the heathen, He shall fill [with] the dead bodies.267 He shall drink of the brook in
the way; therefore shall He lift up the head.’</p>

<p>“And,” I continued, “I am not ignorant that you venture to expound this psalm as if it
referred to king Hezekiah; but that you are mistaken, I shall prove to you from these very
words forthwith. ‘The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,’ it is said; and, ‘Thou art a priest
forever, after the order of Melchizedek,’ with what follows and precedes. Not even you will
venture to object that Hezekiah was either a priest, or is the everlasting priest of God; but
that this is spoken of our Jesus, these expressions show. But your ears are shut up, and your
hearts are made dull.268 For by this statement, ‘The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent:
Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,’ with an oath God has shown Him
(on account of your unbelief) to be the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek; i.e., as
Melchizedek was described by Moses as the priest of the Most High, and he was a priest of
those who were in uncircumcision, and blessed the circumcised Abraham who brought him
tithes, so God has shown that His everlasting Priest, called also by the Holy Spirit Lord,
would be Priest of those in uncircumcision. Those too in circumcision who approach Him,
that is, believing Him and seeking blessings from Him, He will both receive and bless. And
that He shall be first humble as a man, and then exalted, these words at the end of the Psalm
show: ‘He shall drink of the brook in the way,’ and then, ‘Therefore shall He lift up the head.’</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Nor does Ps. lxxii. apply to Solomon, whose faults Christians
shudder at.</head>
<p>“Further, to persuade you that you have not understood anything of the Scriptures, I
will remind you of another psalm, dictated to David by the Holy Spirit, which you say refers
to Solomon, who was also your king. But it refers also to our Christ. But you deceive
yourselves by the ambiguous forms of speech. For where it is said, ‘The law of the Lord is
perfect,’ you do not understand it of the law which was to be after Moses, but of the law
which was given by Moses, although God declared that He would establish a new law and
a new covenant. And where it has been said, ‘O God, give Thy judgment to the king,’ since
Solomon was king, you say that the Psalm refers to him, although the words of the Psalm
expressly proclaim that reference is made to the everlasting King, i.e., to Christ. For Christ
is King, and Priest, and God, and Lord, and angel, and man, and captain, and stone, and a
Son born, and first made subject to suffering, then returning to heaven, and again coming
with glory, and He is preached as having the everlasting kingdom: so I prove from all the
Scriptures. But that you may perceive what I have said, I quote the words of the Psalm; they
are these: ‘O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness unto the king’s
son, to judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment. The mountains
shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor
of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall abase the slanderer. He
shall co-endure with the sun, and before the moon unto all generations. He shall come down
like rain upon the fleece, as drops falling on the earth. In His days shall righteousness
flourish, and abundance of peace until the moon be taken away. And He shall have dominion
from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth. Ethiopians shall fall down
before Him, and His enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and the isles shall
offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and Seba shall offer gifts; and all the kings of the earth shall
worship Him, and all the nations shall serve Him: for He has delivered the poor from the
man of power, and the needy that hath no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and
shall save the souls of the needy: He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice, and
His name shall be honourable before them. And He shall live, and to Him shall be given of
the gold of Arabia, and they shall pray continually for Him: they shall bless Him all the day.
And there shall be a foundation on the earth, it shall be exalted on the tops of the mountains:
His fruit shall be on Lebanon, and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. His
name shalt be blessed for ever. His name shall endure before the sun; and all tribes of the
earth shall be blessed in Him, all nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the
God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things; and blessed be His glorious name for ever,
and for ever and ever; and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen, amen.’269

And at the close of this Psalm which I have quoted, it is written, ‘The hymns of David the
son of Jesse are ended.’270 Moreover, that Solomon was a renowned and great king, by
whom the temple called that at Jerusalem was built, I know; but that none of those things
mentioned in the Psalm happened to him, is evident. For neither did all kings worship him;
nor did he reign to the ends of the earth; nor did his enemies, falling before him, lick the
dust. Nay, also, I venture to repeat what is written in the book of Kings as committed by
him, how through a woman’s influence he worshipped the idols of Sidon, which those of
the Gentiles who know God, the Maker of all things through Jesus the crucified, do not
venture to do, but abide every torture and vengeance even to the extremity of death, rather
than worship idols, or eat meat offered to idols.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Heretics confirm the Catholics in the faith.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus,
and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means
injured in consequence.” And I replied, “The fact that there are such men confessing
themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ,
yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples
of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and stedfast in the hope
announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we
do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, ‘Many shall come in My name,
clothed outwardly in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.’ ”271 And,
‘There shall be schisms and heresies.’272 And, ‘Beware of false prophets, who shall come to
you clothed outwardly in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.’273 And,
‘Many false Christs and false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.’274
There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name
of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called
by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For
some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ,
who was foretold by Him as coming, and the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob,
with whom we have nothing in common, since we know them to be atheists, impious, unrighteous,
and sinful, and confessors of Jesus in name only, instead of worshippers of Him.
Yet they style themselves Christians, just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name
of God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious rites.)
Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians,
and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion,
just as each one of those who consider themselves philosophers, as I said before, thinks he
must bear the name of the philosophy which he follows, from the name of the father of the
particular doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew
what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He
foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we
suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no
word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men
who hate us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him
who, by His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—He proves that Christ is called Lord of Hosts.</head>
<p>Then he replied, “Let these things be so as you say—namely, that it was foretold Christ
would suffer, and be called a stone; and after His first appearance, in which it had been announced
He would suffer, would come in glory, and be Judge finally of all, and eternal King
and Priest. Now show if this man be He of whom these prophecies were made.”</p>
<p>And I said, “As you wish, Trypho, I shall come to these proofs which you seek in the
fitting place; but now you will permit me first to recount the prophecies, which I wish to do
in order to prove that Christ is called both God and Lord of hosts, and Jacob, in parable by
the Holy Spirit; and your interpreters, as God says, are foolish, since they say that reference
is made to Solomon and not to Christ, when he bore the ark of testimony into the temple
which he built. The Psalm of David is this: ‘The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof;
the world, and all that dwell therein. He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon
the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place?
He that is clean of hands and pure of heart: who has not received his soul in vain, and has
not sworn guilefully to his neighbour: he shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy
from God his Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face
of the God of Jacob.275 Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;
and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty
in battle. Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King
of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of
glory.’276 Accordingly, it is shown that Solomon is not the Lord of hosts; but when our
Christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, the rulers in heaven, under appointment
of God, are commanded to open the gates of heaven, that He who is King of glory may enter
in, and having ascended, may sit on the right hand of the Father until He make the enemies
His footstool, as has been made manifest by another Psalm. For when the rulers of heaven
saw Him of uncomely and dishonoured appearance, and inglorious, not recognising Him,
they inquired, ‘Who is this King of glory?’ And the Holy Spirit, either from the person of
His Father, or from His own person, answers them, ‘The Lord of hosts, He is this King of
glory.’ For every one will confess that not one of those who presided over the gates of the
temple at Jerusalem would venture to say concerning Solomon, though he was so glorious
a king, or concerning the ark of testimony, ‘Who is this King of glory?’</p>
<note type="footnote">275 Maranus remarks from Thirlby: “As Justin wrote a little before, ‘and is called Jacob in parable,’ it seems
to convince us that Justin wrote, ‘thy face, O Jacob.’ ” [The meaning in this latter case becomes plain, if we observe

Him whom you do not wish to be king to be King and Lord, both of Samuel, and of Aaron,
and of Moses, and, in short, of all the others. And the words of the Psalm are these: ‘The

law that we should have no intercourse with any of you, and that we should not have even
any communication with you on these questions. For you utter many blasphemies, in that
you seek to persuade us that this crucified man was with Moses and Aaron, and spoke to
them in the pillar of the cloud; then that he became man, was crucified, and ascended up
to heaven, and comes again to earth, and ought to be worshipped.”</p>
<p>Then I answered, “I know that, as the word of God says, this great wisdom of God, the
Maker of all things, and the Almighty, is hid from you. Wherefore, in sympathy with you,
I am striving to the utmost that you may understand these matters which to you are paradoxical;
but if not, that I myself may be innocent in the day of judgment. For you shall hear
other words which appear still more paradoxical; but be not confounded, nay, rather remain
still more zealous hearers and investigators, despising the tradition of your teachers, since
they are convicted by the Holy Spirit of inability to perceive the truths taught by God, and
of preferring to teach their own doctrines. Accordingly, in the forty-fourth [forty-fifth]
Psalm, these words are in like manner referred to Christ: ‘My heart has brought forth a good
matter;280 I tell my works to the King. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Fairer in
beauty than the sons of men: grace is poured forth into Thy lips: therefore hath God blessed

distinction is between both!</head>
<p>“Now it is not surprising,” I continued, “that you hate us who hold these opinions, and
convict you of a continual hardness of heart.284 For indeed Elijah, conversing with God
concerning you, speaks thus: ‘Lord, they have slain Thy prophets, and digged down Thine
altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life.’ And He answers him: ‘I have still seven
thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.’285 Therefore, just as God did not inflict
His anger on account of those seven thousand men, even so He has now neither yet inflicted
judgment, nor does inflict it, knowing that daily some [of you] are becoming disciples in
the name of Christ, and quitting the path of error; who are also receiving gifts, each as he
is worthy, illumined through the name of this Christ. For one receives the spirit of understanding,
another of counsel, another of strength, another of healing, another of foreknowledge,
another of teaching, and another of the fear of God.”</p>
<p>To this Trypho said to me, “I wish you knew that you are beside yourself, talking these
sentiments.”</p>
<p>And I said to him, “Listen, O friend,286 for I am not mad or beside myself; but it was
prophesied that, after the ascent of Christ to heaven, He would deliver287 us from error and
give us gifts. The words are these: ‘He ascended up on high; He led captivity captive; He
gave gifts to men.’288 Accordingly, we who have received gifts from Christ, who has ascended
up on high, prove from the words of prophecy that you, ‘the wise in yourselves, and the
men of understanding in your own eyes,’289 are foolish, and honour God and His Christ
by lip only. But we, who are instructed in the whole truth,290 honour Them both in acts,
and in knowledge, and in heart, even unto death. But you hesitate to confess that He is
Christ, as the Scriptures and the events witnessed and done in His name prove, perhaps for
this reason, lest you be persecuted by the rulers, who, under the influence of the wicked and
deceitful spirit, the serpent, will not cease putting to death and persecuting those who confess
the name of Christ until He come again, and destroy them all, and render to each his deserts.”</p>
<p>And Trypho replied, “Now, then, render us the proof that this man who you say was

<p>“The mystery, then, of the lamb which God enjoined to be sacrificed as the passover,
was a type of Christ; with whose blood, in proportion to their faith in Him, they anoint their
houses, i.e., themselves, who believe on Him. For that the creation which God created—to
wit, Adam—was a house for the spirit which proceeded from God, you all can understand.
And that this injunction was temporary, I prove thus. God does not permit the lamb of the
passover to be sacrificed in any other place than where His name was named; knowing that
the days will come, after the suffering of Christ, when even the place in Jerusalem shall be
given over to your enemies, and all the offerings, in short, shall cease; and that lamb which
was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ
would undergo. For the lamb,291 which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of
the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and
one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb. And the two goats which
were ordered to be offered during the fast, of which one was sent away as the scape [goat],
and the other sacrificed, were similarly declarative of the two appearances of Christ: the
first, in which the elders of your people, and the priests, having laid hands on Him and put
Him to death, sent Him away as the scape [goat]; and His second appearance, because in
the same place in Jerusalem you shall recognise Him whom you have dishonoured, and who

loosening the terms292 of the violent contracts, and keeping the other precepts, likewise
enumerated by him, and which I have quoted,293 which those believing in Jesus do. And
further, you are aware that the offering of the two goats, which were enjoined to be sacrificed
at the fast, was not permitted to take place similarly anywhere else, but only in Jerusalem.</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—The oblation of fine flour was a figure of the Eucharist.</head>
<p>“And the offering of fine flour, sirs,” I said, “which was prescribed to be presented on
behalf of those purified from leprosy, was a type of the bread of the Eucharist, the celebration
of which our Lord Jesus Christ prescribed, in remembrance of the suffering which He endured
on behalf of those who are purified in soul from all iniquity, in order that we may at the
same time thank God for having created the world, with all things therein, for the sake of
man, and for delivering us from the evil in which we were, and for utterly overthrowing294
principalities and powers by Him who suffered according to His will. Hence God speaks by
the mouth of Malachi, one of the twelve [prophets], as I said before,295 about the sacrifices
at that time presented by you: ‘I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; and I will not accept
your sacrifices at your hands: for, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the
same, My name has been glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered
to My name, and a pure offering: for My name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord:
but ye profane it.’296 [So] He then speaks of those Gentiles, namely us, who in every place
offer sacrifices to Him, i.e., the bread of the Eucharist, and also the cup of the Eucharist, affirming
both that we glorify His name, and that you profane [it]. The command of circumcision,
again, bidding [them] always circumcise the children on the eighth day, was a type
of the true circumcision, by which we are circumcised from deceit and iniquity through
Him who rose from the dead on the first day after the Sabbath, [namely through] our Lord
Jesus Christ. For the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first297 of all the days, is
called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet]
remains the first.</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—The bells on the priest’s robe were a figure of the apostles.</head>
<p>“Moreover, the prescription that twelve bells298 be attached to the [robe] of the high
priest, which hung down to the feet, was a symbol of the twelve apostles, who depend on
the power of Christ, the eternal Priest; and through their voice it is that all the earth has
been filled with the glory and grace of God and of His Christ. Wherefore David also says:
‘Their sound has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.’299
And Isaiah speaks as if he were personating the apostles, when they say to Christ that they
believe not in their own report, but in the power of Him who sent them. And so he says:
‘Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have
preached before Him as if [He were] a child, as if a root in a dry ground.’300 (And what
follows in order of the prophecy already quoted.301) But when the passage speaks as from
the lips of many, ‘We have preached before Him,’ and adds, ‘as if a child,’ it signifies that
the wicked shall become subject to Him, and shall obey His command, and that all shall
become as one child. Such a thing as you may witness in the body: although the members
are enumerated as many, all are called one, and are a body. For, indeed, a commonwealth
and a church,302 though many individuals in number, are in fact as one, called and addressed
by one appellation. And in short, sirs,” said I, “by enumerating all the other appointments
of Moses, I can demonstrate that they were types, and symbols, and declarations of those
things which would happen to Christ, of those who it was foreknown were to believe in
Him, and of those things which would also be done by Christ Himself. But since what I have
now enumerated appears to me to be sufficient, I revert again to the order of the discourse.303</p>

<head>Chapter XLIII.—He concludes that the law had an end in Christ, who was born
of the Virgin.</head>
<p>“As, then, circumcision began with Abraham, and the Sabbath and sacrifices and offerings
and feasts with Moses, and it has been proved they were enjoined on account of the hardness
of your people’s heart, so it was necessary, in accordance with the Father’s will, that they
should have an end in Him who was born of a virgin, of the family of Abraham and tribe
of Judah, and of David; in Christ the Son of God, who was proclaimed as about to come to
all the world, to be the everlasting law and the everlasting covenant, even as the forementioned
prophecies show. And we, who have approached God through Him, have received
not carnal, but spiritual circumcision, which Enoch and those like him observed. And we
have received it through baptism, since we were sinners, by God’s mercy; and all men may
equally obtain it. But since the mystery of His birth now demands our attention I shall speak
of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the generation of Christ, that it could not be declared
by man, in words already quoted:304 ‘Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken
from the earth: for the transgressions of my people was He led305 to death.’306 The Spirit
of prophecy thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to die, that we sinful men
might be healed by His stripes, was such as could not be declared. Furthermore, that the
men who believe in Him may possess the knowledge of the manner in which He came into
the world,307 the Spirit of prophecy by the same Isaiah foretold how it would happen thus:
‘And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God,
in the depth, or in the height. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to contend with
men, and how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a
sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called
Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows or prefers the evil, and chooses
out the good;308 for before the child knows good or ill, he rejects evil309 by choosing out
the good. For before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall receive the power
of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall
be forsaken,310 which thou shalt with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of

father, days which have not yet come upon thee since the day in which Ephraim took away
from Judah the king of Assyria.’312 Now it is evident to all, that in the race of Abraham according
to the flesh no one has been born of a virgin, or is said to have been born [of a virgin],
save this our Christ. But since you and your teachers venture to affirm that in the prophecy
of Isaiah it is not said, ‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive,’ but, ‘Behold, the young woman
shall conceive, and bear a son;’ and [since] you explain the prophecy as if [it referred] to

<head>Chapter XLIV.—The Jews in vain promise themselves salvation, which cannot
be obtained except through Christ.</head>
<p>“For thus, so far as you are concerned, I shall be found in all respects innocent, if I strive
earnestly to persuade you by bringing forward demonstrations. But if you remain hardhearted,
or weak in [forming] a resolution, on account of death, which is the lot of the
Christians, and are unwilling to assent to the truth, you shall appear as the authors of your
own [evils]. And you deceive yourselves while you fancy that, because you are the seed of
Abraham after the flesh, therefore you shall fully inherit the good things announced to be
bestowed by God through Christ. For no one, not even of them,313 has anything to look
for, but only those who in mind are assimilated to the faith of Abraham, and who have recognised
all the mysteries: for I say,314 that some injunctions were laid on you in reference
to the worship of God and practice of righteousness; but some injunctions and acts were
likewise mentioned in reference to the mystery of Christ, on account of315 the hardness of
your people’s hearts. And that this is so, God makes known in Ezekiel, [when] He said
concerning it: ‘If Noah and Jacob316 and Daniel should beg either sons or daughters, the
request would not be granted them.’317 And in Isaiah, of the very same matter He spake
thus: ‘The Lord God said, they shall both go forth and look on the members [of the bodies]
of the men that have transgressed. For their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be
quenched, and they shall be a gazing-stock to all flesh.’318 So that it becomes you to eradicate
this hope from your souls, and hasten to know in what way forgiveness of sins, and a hope
of inheriting the promised good things, shall be yours. But there is no other [way] than this,
—to become acquainted with this Christ, to be washed in the fountain319 spoken of by
Isaiah for the remission of sins; and for the rest, to live sinless lives.”</p>

on the latter, but on the former; and without such recognition, a Jew would, as Justin says, rest his hopes on his

<p>And Trypho said, “If I seem to interrupt these matters, which you say must be investigated,
yet the question which I mean to put is urgent. Suffer me first.”</p>
<p>And I replied, “Ask whatever you please, as it occurs to you; and I shall endeavour, after
questions and answers, to resume and complete the discourse.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Tell me, then, shall those who lived according to the law given by Moses,
live in the same manner with Jacob, Enoch, and Noah, in the resurrection of the dead, or
not?”</p>
<p>I replied to him, “When I quoted, sir, the words spoken by Ezekiel, that ‘even if Noah
and Daniel and Jacob were to beg sons and daughters, the request would not be granted
them,’ but that each one, that is to say, shall be saved by his own righteousness, I said also,
that those who regulated their lives by the law of Moses would in like manner be saved. For
what in the law of Moses is naturally good, and pious, and righteous, and has been prescribed
to be done by those who obey it;320 and what was appointed to be performed by reason of
the hardness of the people’s hearts; was similarly recorded, and done also by those who were
under the law. Since those who did that which is universally, naturally, and eternally good
are pleasing to God, they shall be saved through this Christ in the resurrection equally with
those righteous men who were before them, namely Noah, and Enoch, and Jacob, and
whoever else there be, along with those who have known321 this Christ, Son of God, who
was before the morning star and the moon, and submitted to become incarnate, and be
born of this virgin of the family of David, in order that, by this dispensation, the serpent
that sinned from the beginning, and the angels like him, may be destroyed, and that death
may be contemned, and for ever quit, at the second coming of the Christ Himself, those

be saved. Justin proves that it contributes nothing to righteousness.</head>
<p>“But if some, even now, wish to live in the observance of the institutions given by Moses,
and yet believe in this Jesus who was crucified, recognising Him to be the Christ of God,
and that it is given to Him to be absolute Judge of all, and that His is the everlasting kingdom,
can they also be saved?” he inquired of me.</p>
<p>And I replied, “Let us consider that also together, whether one may now observe all the
Mosaic institutions.”</p>
<p>And he answered, “No. For we know that, as you said, it is not possible either anywhere
to sacrifice the lamb of the passover, or to offer the goats ordered for the fast; or, in short,
[to present] all the other offerings.”</p>
<p>And I said, “Tell [me] then yourself, I pray, some things which can be observed; for you
will be persuaded that, though a man does not keep or has not performed the eternal322
decrees, he may assuredly be saved.”</p>
<p>Then he replied, “To keep the Sabbath, to be circumcised, to observe months, and to
be washed if you touch anything prohibited by Moses, or after sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>And I said, “Do you think that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, and Job, and all the rest
before or after them equally righteous, also Sarah the wife of Abraham, Rebekah the wife
of Isaac, Rachel the wife of Jacob, and Leah, and all the rest of them, until the mother of
Moses the faithful servant, who observed none of these [statutes], will be saved?”</p>
<p>And Trypho answered, “Were not Abraham and his descendants circumcised?”</p>
<p>And I said, “I know that Abraham and his descendants were circumcised. The reason
why circumcision was given to them I stated at length in what has gone before; and if what
has been said does not convince you,323 let us again search into the matter. But you are
aware that, up to Moses, no one in fact who was righteous observed any of these rites at all
of which we are talking, or received one commandment to observe, except that of circumcision,
which began from Abraham.”</p>
<p>And he replied, “We know it, and admit that they are saved.”</p>
<p>Then I returned answer, “You perceive that God by Moses laid all such ordinances upon
you on account of the hardness of your people’s hearts, in order that, by the large number
of them, you might keep God continually, and in every action, before your eyes, and never
begin to act unjustly or impiously. For He enjoined you to place around you [a fringe] of

having sacrificed your children to idols. But we, because we refuse to sacrifice to those to
whom we were of old accustomed to sacrifice, undergo extreme penalties, and rejoice in
death,—believing that God will raise us up by His Christ, and will make us incorruptible,

these [institutions], will he be saved?”</p>
<p>I said, “In my opinion, Trypho, such an one will be saved, if he does not strive in every
way to persuade other men, —I mean those Gentiles who have been circumcised from error
by Christ, to observe the same things as himself, telling them that they will not be saved
unless they do so. This you did yourself at the commencement of the discourse, when you
declared that I would not be saved unless I observe these institutions.”</p>
<p>Then he replied, “Why then have you said, ‘In my opinion, such an one will be saved,’
unless there are some327 who affirm that such will not be saved?”</p>
<p>“There are such people, Trypho,” I answered; “and these do not venture to have any
intercourse with or to extend hospitality to such persons; but I do not agree with them. But
if some, through weak-mindedness, wish to observe such institutions as were given by Moses,
from which they expect some virtue, but which we believe were appointed by reason of the
hardness of the people’s hearts, along with their hope in this Christ, and [wish to perform]
the eternal and natural acts of righteousness and piety, yet choose to live with the Christians
and the faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either to be circumcised like themselves,
or to keep the Sabbath, or to observe any other such ceremonies, then I hold that we ought
to join ourselves to such, and associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren.
But if, Trypho,” I continued, “some of your race, who say they believe in this Christ, compel
those Gentiles who believe in this Christ to live in all respects according to the law given by
Moses, or choose not to associate so intimately with them, I in like manner do not approve
of them. But I believe that even those, who have been persuaded by them to observe the
legal dispensation along with their confession of God in Christ, shall probably be saved.
And I hold, further, that such as have confessed and known this man to be Christ, yet who
have gone back from some cause to the legal dispensation, and have denied that this man
is Christ, and have repented not before death, shall by no means be saved. Further, I hold
that those of the seed of Abraham who live according to the law, and do not believe in this

<p>And Trypho said, “We have heard what you think of these matters. Resume the discourse
where you left off, and bring it to an end. For some of it appears to me to be paradoxical,
and wholly incapable of proof. For when you say that this Christ existed as God before the
ages, then that He submitted to be born and become man, yet that He is not man of man,
this [assertion] appears to me to be not merely paradoxical, but also foolish.”</p>
<p>And I replied to this, “I know that the statement does appear to be paradoxical, especially
to those of your race, who are ever unwilling to understand or to perform the [requirements]
of God, but [ready to perform] those of your teachers, as God Himself declares.331 Now
assuredly, Trypho,"I continued,"[the proof] that this man332 is the Christ of God does not
fail, though I be unable to prove that He existed formerly as Son of the Maker of all things,
being God, and was born a man by the Virgin. But since I have certainly proved that this
man is the Christ of God, whoever He be, even if I do not prove that He pre-existed, and
submitted to be born a man of like passions with us, having a body, according to the Father’s
will; in this last matter alone is it just to say that I have erred, and not to deny that He is the
Christ, though it should appear that He was born man of men, and [nothing more] is proved

“of our race,333 who admit that He is Christ, while holding Him to be man of men; with
whom I do not agree, nor would I,334 even though most of those who have [now] the same

that he is the precursor of the first advent.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “Those who affirm him to have been a man, and to have been
anointed by election, and then to have become Christ, appear to me to speak more plausibly
than you who hold those opinions which you express. For we all expect that Christ will be
a man [born] of men, and that Elijah when he comes will anoint him. But if this man appear
to be Christ, he must certainly be known as man [born] of men; but from the circumstance
that Elijah has not yet come, I infer that this man is not He [the Christ].”</p>
<p>Then I inquired of him, “Does not Scripture, in the book of Zechariah,336 say that Elijah
shall come before the great and terrible day of the Lord?”</p>
<p>And he answered, “Certainly.”</p>
<p>“If therefore Scripture compels you to admit that two advents of Christ were predicted
to take place,—one in which He would appear suffering, and dishonoured, and without
comeliness; but the other in which He would come glorious and Judge of all, as has been
made manifest in many of the fore-cited passages,—shall we not suppose that the word of
God has proclaimed that Elijah shall be the precursor of the great and terrible day, that is,
of His second advent?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” he answered.</p>
<p>“And, accordingly, our Lord in His teaching,” I continued, “proclaimed that this very
thing would take place, saying that Elijah would also come. And we know that this shall take
place when our Lord Jesus Christ shall come in glory from heaven; whose first manifestation
the Spirit of God who was in Elijah preceded as herald in [the person of] John, a prophet
among your nation; after whom no other prophet appeared among you. He cried, as he sat
by the river Jordan: ‘I baptize you with water to repentance; but He that is stronger than I
shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
and with fire: whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor, and will
gather the wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.’337
And this very prophet your king Herod had shut up in prison; and when his birthday was
celebrated, and the niece338 of the same Herod by her dancing had pleased him, he told her
to ask whatever she pleased. Then the mother of the maiden instigated her to ask the head
of John, who was in prison; and having asked it, [Herod] sent and ordered the head of John
to be brought in on a charger. Wherefore also our Christ said, [when He was] on earth, to
those who were affirming that Elijah must come before Christ: ‘Elijah shall come, and restore
all things; but I say unto you, that Elijah has already come, and they knew him not, but have

done to him whatsoever they chose.’339 And it is written, ‘Then the disciples understood
that He spake to them about John the Baptist.’ ”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “This statement also seems to me paradoxical; namely, that the
prophetic Spirit of God, who was in Elijah, was also in John.”</p>
<p>To this I replied, “Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua
the son of Nave (Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when
Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, ‘I will take of the
spirit which is in thee, and put it on him?’ ”340</p>
<p>And he said, “Certainly.”</p>
<p>“As therefore,” I say, “while Moses was still among men, God took of the spirit which
was in Moses and put it on Joshua, even so God was able to cause [the spirit] of Elijah to
come upon John; in order that, as Christ at His first coming appeared inglorious, even so
the first coming of the spirit, which remained always pure in Elijah341 like that of Christ,
might be perceived to be inglorious. For the Lord said He would wage war against Amalek
with concealed hand; and you will not deny that Amalek fell. But if it is said that only in the
glorious advent of Christ war will be waged with Amalek, how great will the fulfilment342
of Scripture be which says, ‘God will wage war against Amalek with concealed hand!’ You
can perceive that the concealed power of God was in Christ the crucified, before whom
demons, and all the principalities and powers of the earth, tremble.”</p>

<p>And Trypho said, “You seem to me to have come out of a great conflict with many
persons about all the points we have been searching into, and therefore quite ready to return
answers to all questions put to you. Answer me then, first, how you can show that there is
another God besides the Maker of all things; and then you will show, [further], that He

before this our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

Good is the word of the Lord which He spake: Let there be peace and righteousness in my
days.’343 And, ‘Encourage the people; ye priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and encourage
her, because her humiliation is accomplished. Her sin is annulled; for she has received
of the Lord’s hand double for her sins. A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the
ways of the Lord; make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled up, and
every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
the rough way shall be plain ways; and the glory of the Lord shall be seen, and all flesh shall
see the salvation of God: for the Lord hath spoken it. A voice of one saying, Cry; and I said,
What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass
has withered, and the flower of it has fallen away; but the word of the Lord endureth for
ever. Thou that bringest good tidings to Zion, go up to the high mountain; thou that
bringest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift ye up, be not afraid;
tell the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold, the Lord comes with strength, and [His]
arm comes with authority. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him. As
a shepherd He will tend His flock, and will gather the lambs with [His] arm, and cheer on
her that is with young. Who has measured the water with [his] hand, and the heaven with
a span, and all the earth with [his] fist? Who has weighed the mountains, and [put] the valleys
into a balance? Who has known the mind of the Lord? And who has been His counsellor,
and who shall advise Him? Or with whom did He take counsel, and he instructed Him? Or
who showed Him judgment? Or who made Him to know the way of understanding? All the
nations are reckoned as a drop of a bucket, and as a turning of a balance, and shall be
reckoned as spittle. But Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts sufficient for a
burnt-offering; and all the nations are considered nothing, and for nothing.’ ”344</p>

<p>And when I ceased, Trypho said, “All the words of the prophecy you repeat, sir, are
ambiguous, and have no force in proving what you wish to prove.” Then I answered, “If
the prophets had not ceased, so that there were no more in your nation, Trypho, after this
John, it is evident that what I say in reference to Jesus Christ might be regarded perhaps as
ambiguous. But if John came first calling on men to repent, and Christ, while [John] still
sat by the river Jordan, having come, put an end to his prophesying and baptizing, and
preached also Himself, saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that He must
suffer many things from the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day
rise again, and would appear again in Jerusalem, and would again eat and drink with His
disciples; and foretold that in the interval between His [first and second] advent, as I previously
said,345 priests and false prophets would arise in His name, which things do actually
appear; then how can they be ambiguous, when you may be persuaded by the facts? Moreover,
He referred to the fact that there would be no longer in your nation any prophet, and to the
fact that men recognised how that the New Testament, which God formerly announced
[His intention of] promulgating, was then present, i.e., Christ Himself; and in the following
terms: ‘The law and the prophets were until John the Baptist; from that time the kingdom
of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. And if you can346 receive it,

<head>Chapter LII.—Jacob predicted two advents of Christ.</head>
<p>“And it was prophesied by Jacob the patriarch348 that there would be two advents of
Christ, and that in the first He would suffer, and that after He came there would be neither
prophet nor king in your nation (I proceeded), and that the nations who believed in the
suffering Christ would look for His future appearance. And for this reason the Holy Spirit
had uttered these truths in a parable, and obscurely: for,” I added, “it is said, ‘Judah, thy
brethren have praised thee: thy hands [shall be] on the neck of thine enemies; the sons of
thy father shall worship thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the germ, my son, thou art sprung
up. Reclining, he lay down like a lion, and like [a lion’s] whelp: who shall raise him up? A
ruler shall not depart from Judah, or a leader from his thighs, until that which is laid up in
store for him shall come; and he shall be the desire of nations, binding his foal to the vine,
and the foal of his ass to the tendril of the vine. He shall wash his garments in wine, and his
vesture in the blood of the grape. His eyes shall be bright with349 wine, and his teeth white
like milk.’350 Moreover, that in your nation there never failed either prophet or ruler, from
the time when they began until the time when this Jesus Christ appeared and suffered, you
will not venture shamelessly to assert, nor can you prove it. For though you affirm that
Herod, after351 whose [reign] He suffered, was an Ashkelonite, nevertheless you admit that
there was a high priest in your nation; so that you then had one who presented offerings
according to the law of Moses, and observed the other legal ceremonies; also [you had]
prophets in succession until John, (even then, too, when your nation was carried captive to
Babylon, when your land was ravaged by war, and the sacred vessels carried off); there
never failed to be a prophet among you, who was lord, and leader, and ruler of your nation.
For the Spirit which was in the prophets anointed your kings, and established them. But
after the manifestation and death of our Jesus Christ in your nation, there was and is nowhere
any prophet: nay, further, you ceased to exist under your own king, your land was laid waste,
and forsaken like a lodge in a vineyard; and the statement of Scripture, in the mouth of
Jacob, ‘And He shall be the desire of nations,’ meant symbolically His two advents, and that
the nations would believe in Him; which facts you may now at length discern. For those out
of all the nations who are pious and righteous through the faith of Christ, look for His future
appearance.</p>

<head>Chapter LIII.—Jacob predicted that Christ would ride on an ass, and Zechariah
confirms it.</head>
<p>“And that expression, ‘binding his foal to the vine, and the ass’s foal to the vine tendril,’
was a declaring beforehand both of the works wrought by Him at His first advent, and also
of that belief in Him which the nations would repose. For they were like an unharnessed
foal, which was not bearing a yoke on its neck, until this Christ came, and sent His disciples
to instruct them; and they bore the yoke of His word, and yielded the neck to endure all
[hardships], for the sake of the good things promised by Himself, and expected by them.
And truly our Lord Jesus Christ, when He intended to go into Jerusalem, requested His
disciples to bring Him a certain ass, along with its foal, which was bound in an entrance of
a village called Bethphage; and having seated Himself on it, He entered into Jerusalem. And
as this was done by Him in the manner in which it was prophesied in precise terms that it
would be done by the Christ, and as the fulfilment was recognised, it became a clear proof
that He was the Christ. And though all this happened and is proved from Scripture, you are
still hard-hearted. Nay, it was prophesied by Zechariah, one of the twelve [prophets], that
such would take place, in the following words: ‘Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, and
declare, daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come to thee, righteous, bringing
salvation, meek, and lowly, riding on an ass, and the foal of an ass.’352 Now, that the Spirit
of prophecy, as well as the patriarch Jacob, mentioned both an ass and its foal, which would
be used by Him; and, further, that He, as I previously said, requested His disciples to bring
both beasts; [this fact] was a prediction that you of the synagogue, along with the Gentiles,
would believe in Him. For as the unharnessed colt was a symbol of the Gentiles even so the
harnessed ass was a symbol of your nation. For you possess the law which was imposed
[upon you] by the prophets. Moreover, the prophet Zechariah foretold that this same Christ
would be smitten, and His disciples scattered: which also took place. For after His crucifixion,
the disciples that accompanied Him were dispersed, until He rose from the dead, and persuaded
them that so it had been prophesied concerning Him, that He would suffer; and
being thus persuaded, they went into all the world, and taught these truths. Hence also we
are strong in His faith and doctrine, since we have [this our] persuasion both from the
prophets, and from those who throughout the world are seen to be worshippers of God in
the name of that crucified One. The following is said, too, by Zechariah: ‘O sword, rise up
against My Shepherd, and against the man of My people, saith the Lord of hosts. Smite the
Shepherd, and His flock shall be scattered.’353</p>

<p>“And that expression which was committed to writing354 by Moses, and prophesied by
the patriarch Jacob, namely, ‘He shall wash His garments with wine, and His vesture with
the blood of the grape,’ signified that He would wash those that believe in Him with His
own blood. For the Holy Spirit called those who receive remission of sins through Him, His
garments; amongst whom He is always present in power, but will be manifestly present at
His second coming. That the Scripture mentions the blood of the grape has been evidently
designed, because Christ derives blood not from the seed of man, but from the power of
God. For as God, and not man, has produced the blood of the vine, so also [the Scripture]
has predicted that the blood of Christ would be not of the seed of man, but of the power of
God. But this prophecy, sirs, which I repeated, proves that Christ is not man of men, begotten
in the ordinary course of humanity.”</p>

<head>Chapter LV.—Trypho asks that Christ be proved God, but without metaphor.
Justin promises to do so.</head>
<p>And Trypho answered, “We shall remember this your exposition, if you strengthen
[your solution of] this difficulty by other arguments: but now resume the discourse, and
show us that the Spirit of prophecy admits another God besides the Maker of all things,
taking care not to speak of the sun and moon, which, it is written,355 God has given to the
nations to worship as gods; and oftentimes the prophets, employing356 this manner of
speech, say that ‘thy God is a God of gods, and a Lord of lords,’ adding frequently, ‘the great
and strong and terrible [God].’ For such expressions are used, not as if they really were gods,
but because the Scripture is teaching us that the true God, who made all things, is Lord alone
of those who are reputed gods and lords. And in order that the Holy Spirit may convince
[us] of this, He said by the holy David, ‘The gods of the nations, reputed gods, are idols of
demons, and not gods;’357 and He denounces a curse on those who worship them.”</p>
<p>And I replied, “I would not bring forward these proofs, Trypho, by which I am aware
those who worship these [idols] and such like are condemned, but such [proofs] as no one
could find any objection to. They will appear strange to you, although you read them every
day; so that even from this fact we358 understand that, because of your wickedness, God has
withheld from you the ability to discern the wisdom of His Scriptures; yet [there are] some
exceptions, to whom, according to the grace of His long-suffering, as Isaiah said, He has
left a seed of359 salvation, lest your race be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah.

<head>Chapter LVI.—God who appeared to Moses is distinguished from God the Father.</head>
<p>“Moses, then, the blessed and faithful servant of God, declares that He who appeared
to Abraham under the oak in Mamre is God, sent with the two angels in His company to
judge Sodom by Another who remains ever in the supercelestial places, invisible to all men,
holding personal intercourse with none, whom we believe to be Maker and Father of all
things; for he speaks thus: ‘God appeared to him under the oak in Mamre, as he sat at his
tent-door at noontide. And lifting up his eyes, he saw, and behold, three men stood before
him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent; and he bowed
himself toward the ground, and said;’ ”361 (and so on;)362 “ ‘Abraham gat up early in the
morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: and he looked toward Sodom and
Gomorrah, and toward the adjacent country, and beheld, and, lo, a flame went up from the
earth, like the smoke of a furnace.’ ” And when I had made an end of quoting these words,
I asked them if they had understood them.</p>
<p>And they said they had understood them, but that the passages adduced brought forward
no proof that there is any other God or Lord, or that the Holy Spirit says so, besides the
Maker of all things.</p>
<p>Then I replied, “I shall attempt to persuade you, since you have understood the Scriptures,
[of the truth] of what I say, that there is, and that there is said to be, another God and
Lord subject to363 the Maker of all things; who is also called an Angel, because He announces
to men whatsoever the Maker of all things—above whom there is no other God—wishes to
announce to them.” And quoting once more the previous passage, I asked Trypho, “Do you
think that God appeared to Abraham under the oak in Mamre, as the Scripture asserts?”</p>
<p>He said, “Assuredly.”</p>
<p>“Was He one of those three,” I said, “whom Abraham saw, and whom the Holy Spirit
of prophecy describes as men?”</p>
<p>He said, “No; but God appeared to him, before the vision of the three. Then those three
whom the Scripture calls men, were angels; two of them sent to destroy Sodom, and one to
announce the joyful tidings to Sarah, that she would bear a son; for which cause he was sent,
and having accomplished his errand, went away.”364</p>
<p>“How then,” said I, “does the one of the three, who was in the tent, and who said, ‘I shall
return to thee hereafte r, and Sarah shall have a son,’365 appear to have returned when Sarah

<pb n="596"/>
had begotten a son, and to be there declared, by the prophetic word, God? But that you may
clearly discern what I say, listen to the words expressly employed by Moses; they are these:
‘And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian bond-woman, whom she bore to Abraham,
sporting with Isaac her son, and said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son;
for the son of this bond-woman shall not share the inheritance of my son Isaac. And the
matter seemed very grievous in Abraham’s sight, because of his son. But God said to Abraham,
Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the son, and because of the bond-woman.
In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be
called.’366 Have you perceived, then, that He who said under the oak that He would return,
since He knew it would be necessary to advise Abraham to do what Sarah wished him, came
back as it is written; and is God, as the words declare, when they so speak: ‘God said to Abraham,
Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the son, and because of the bond-woman?’
” I inquired. And Trypho said, “Certainly; but you have not proved from this that
there is another God besides Him who appeared to Abraham, and who also appeared to the
other patriarchs and prophets. You have proved, however, that we were wrong in believing
that the three who were in the tent with Abraham were all angels.”</p>
<p>I replied again, “If I could not have proved to you from the Scriptures that one of those
three is God, and is called Angel,367 because, as I already said, He brings messages to those
to whom God the Maker of all things wishes [messages to be brought], then in regard to
Him who appeared to Abraham on earth in human form in like manner as the two angels
who came with Him, and who was God even before the creation of the world, it were reasonable
for you to entertain the same belief as is entertained by the whole of your nation.”</p>
<p>“Assuredly,” he said, “for up to this moment this has been our belief.”</p>
<p>Then I replied, “Reverting to the Scriptures, I shall endeavour to persuade you, that He
who is said to have appeared to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, and who is called
God, is distinct from Him who made all things,—numerically, I mean, not [distinct] in will.
For I affirm that He has never at any time done368 anything which He who made the
world—above whom there is no other God—has not wished Him both to do and to engage
Himself with.”</p>

<note type="footnote">367 Or, “Messenger.” [The “Jehovah-angel” of the Pentateuch, passim.] In the various passages in which Justin
assigns the reason for Christ being called angel or messenger, Justin uses also the verb ἀγγέλλω, to convey
messages, to announce. The similarity between ἄγγελος and ἀγγέλλω cannot be retained in English, and
therefore the point of Justin’s remarks is lost to the English reader.</note>
<note type="footnote">368 Some supply, “or said.”</note>

<pb n="597"/>
<p>And Trypho said, “Prove now that this is the case, that we also may agree with you. For
we do not understand you to affirm that He has done or said anything contrary to the will
of the Maker of all things.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “The Scripture just quoted by me will make this plain to you. It is thus: ‘The
sun was risen on the earth, and Lot entered into Segor (Zoar); and the Lord rained on Sodom
sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and overthrew these cities and all the neighbourhood.’
”369</p>
<p>Then the fourth of those who had remained with Trypho said, “It370 must therefore
necessarily be said that one of the two angels who went to Sodom, and is named by Moses
in the Scripture Lord, is different from Him who also is God, and appeared to Abraham.”371</p>
<p>“It is not on this ground solely,” I said, “that it must be admitted absolutely that some
other one is called Lord by the Holy Spirit besides Him who is considered Maker of all
things; not solely [for what is said] by Moses, but also [for what is said] by David. For there
is written by him: ‘The Lord says to my Lord, Sit on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies
Thy footstool,’372 as I have already quoted. And again, in other words: ‘Thy throne,
O God, is for ever and ever. A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Thy kingdom: Thou hast
loved righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee
with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.’373 If, therefore, you assert that the Holy Spirit
calls some other one God and Lord, besides the Father of all things and His Christ, answer
me; for I undertake to prove to you from Scriptures themselves, that He whom the Scripture
calls Lord is not one of the two angels that went to Sodom, but He who was with them, and
is called God, that appeared to Abraham.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “Prove this; for, as you see, the day advances, and we are not prepared
for such perilous replies; since never yet have we heard any man investigating, or searching
into, or proving these matters; nor would we have tolerated your conversation, had you not
referred everything to the Scriptures:374 for you are very zealous in adducing proofs from
them; and you are of opinion that there is no God above the Maker of all things.”</p>

<p>Then I replied, “You are aware, then, that the Scripture says, ‘And the Lord said to Abraham,
Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I truly conceive? for I am old. Is anything impossible
with God? At the time appointed shall I return to thee according to the time of life,
and Sarah shall have a son.’375 And after a little interval: ‘And the men rose up from thence,
and looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah; and Abraham went with them, to bring them
on the way. And the Lord said, I will not conceal from Abraham, my servant, what I do.’376
And again, after a little, it thus says: ‘The Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great,377 and their sins are very grievous. I will go down now, and see whether they have
done altogether according to their cry which has come unto me; and if not, that I may know.
And the men turned away thence, and went to Sodom. But Abraham was standing before
the Lord; and Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt Thou destroy the righteous with the
wicked?’ ”378 (and so on,379 for I do not think fit to write over again the same words, having
written them all before, but shall of necessity give those by which I established the proof to
Trypho and his companions. Then I proceeded to what follows, in which these words are
recorded:) “ ‘And the Lord went His way as soon as He had left communing with Abraham;
and [Abraham] went to his place. And there came two angels to Sodom at even. And Lot
sat in the gate of Sodom;’380 and what follows until, ‘But the men put forth their hands, and
pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door of the house;’381 and what follows
till, ‘And the angels laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hands of
his daughters, the Lord being merciful to him. And it came to pass, when they had brought
them forth abroad, that they said, Save, save thy life. Look not behind thee, nor stay in all
the neighbourhood; escape to the mountain, lest thou be taken along with [them]. And Lot
said to them, I beseech [Thee], O Lord, since Thy servant hath found grace in Thy sight,
and Thou hast magnified Thy righteousness, which Thou showest towards me in saving my
life; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. Behold, this city
is near to flee unto, and it is small: there I shall be safe, since it is small; and any soul shall
live. And He said to him, Behold, I have accepted thee382 also in this matter, so as not to
destroy the city for which thou hast spoken. Make haste to save thyself there; for I shall not
do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore he called the name of the city Segor (Zoar).

on Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew
these cities, and all the neighbourhood.’ ”383 And after another pause I added: “And now
have you not perceived, my friends, that one of the three, who is both God and Lord, and
ministers to Him who is in the heavens, is Lord of the two angels? For when [the angels]
proceeded to Sodom, He remained behind, and communed with Abraham in the words
recorded by Moses; and when He departed after the conversation, Abraham went back to
his place. And when he came [to Sodom], the two angels no longer conversed with Lot, but
Himself, as the Scripture makes evident; and He is the Lord who received commission from
the Lord who [remains] in the heavens, i.e., the Maker of all things, to inflict upon Sodom
and Gomorrah the [judgments] which the Scripture describes in these terms: ‘The Lord
rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.’ ”</p>

<head>Chapter LVII.—The Jew objects, why is He said to have eaten, if He be God?
Answer of Justin.</head>
<p>Then Trypho said when I was silent, “That Scripture compels us to admit this, is manifest;
but there is a matter about which we are deservedly at a loss —namely, about what was said
to the effect that [the Lord] ate what was prepared and placed before him by Abraham; and
you would admit this.”</p>
<p>I answered, “It is written that they ate; and if we believe384 that it is said the three ate,
and not the two alone—who were really angels, and are nourished in the heavens, as is
evident to us, even though they are not nourished by food similar to that which mortals
use—(for, concerning the sustenance of manna which supported your fathers in the desert,
Scripture speaks thus, that they ate angels’ food): [if we believe that three ate], then I would
say that the Scripture which affirms they ate bears the same meaning as when we would say
about fire that it has devoured all things; yet it is not certainly understood that they ate,
masticating with teeth and jaws. So that not even here should we be at a loss about anything,
if we are acquainted even slightly with figurative modes of expression, and able to rise above
them.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “It is possible that [the question] about the mode of eating may be
thus explained: [the mode, that is to say,] in which it is written, they took and ate what had
been prepared by Abraham: so that you may now proceed to explain to us how this God
who appeared to Abraham, and is minister to God the Maker of all things, being born of
the Virgin, became man, of like passions with all, as you said previously.”</p>
<p>Then I replied, “Permit me first, Trypho, to collect some other proofs on this head, so
that you, by the large number of them, may be persuaded of [the truth of] it, and thereafter
I shall explain what you ask.”</p>
<p>And he said, “Do as seems good to you; for I shall be thoroughly pleased.”</p>

<p>Then I continued, “I purpose to quote to you Scriptures, not that I am anxious to make
merely an artful display of words; for I possess no such faculty, but God’s grace alone has
been granted to me to the understanding of His Scriptures, of which grace I exhort all to
become partakers freely and bounteously, in order that they may not, through want of it,385
incur condemnation in the judgment which God the Maker of all things shall hold through
my Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “What you do is worthy of the worship of God; but you appear to me
to feign ignorance when you say that you do not possess a store of artful words.”
I again replied, “Be it so, since you think so; yet I am persuaded that I speak the truth.386
But give me your attention, that I may now rather adduce the remaining proofs.”
“Proceed,” said he.</p>
<p>And I continued: “It is again written by Moses, my brethren, that He who is called God
and appeared to the patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord, in order that from this you
may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all things, as you have already admitted,
and may remain firm, persuaded by additional arguments. The word of God, therefore,
[recorded] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: ‘And
it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And,
behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted
with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel of God said to
me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And He said, Lift up thine eyes,
and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with
white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban doeth unto
thee. I am the God who appeared to thee in Bethel,387 where thou anointedst a pillar and
vowedst a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get thee out of this land, and depart to
the land of thy birth, and I shall be with thee.’388 And again, in other words, speaking of the
same Jacob, it thus says: ‘And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and the two
women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took
them and went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was left behind
alone, and an Angel389 wrestled with him until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing
against him, and He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob’s thigh

grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaketh. But
he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is thy name?
And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall
be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt be powerful. And Jacob
asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he said, Why dost thou ask after My name?
And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of that place Peniel,390 for I saw God
face to face, and my soul rejoiced.’391 And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob,
it says the following: ‘And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and
all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that
place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother Esau.
And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and
Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz,
when he came out from Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him,
Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name.’392 He is called God,
and He is and shall be God.” And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued:
“Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who
is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled
in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are
as follows: ‘And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,393 and went toward Charran.394
And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones
of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and,
behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of
God ascended and descended upon it. And the Lord stood395 above it, and He said, I am
the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou
liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and
shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and in thy seed,
shall all families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, keeping thee in every
way wherein thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee,
until I have done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and
said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How
dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his head,

and who appeared in human form to Abraham and Isaac,397 appeared in a flame of fire

patiently, and eagerly, I went on: “These words are in the book which bears the title of Exodus:
‘And after many days the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned by reason
of the works;’398 and so on until, ‘Go and gather the elders of Israel, and thou shalt say unto
them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I am surely beholding you, and the things which have
befallen you in Egypt.’ ”399 In addition to these words, I went on: “Have you perceived, sirs,
that this very God whom Moses speaks of as an Angel that talked to him in the flame of fire,
declares to Moses that He is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob?”</p>

<head>Chapter LX.—Opinions of the Jews with regard to Him who appeared in the
bush.</head>
<p>Then Trypho said, “We do not perceive this from the passage quoted by you, but [only
this], that it was an angel who appeared in the flame of fire, but God who conversed with
Moses; so that there were really two persons in company with each other, an angel and God,
that appeared in that vision.”</p>
<p>I again replied, “Even if this were so, my friends, that an angel and God were together
in the vision seen by Moses, yet, as has already been proved to you by the passages previously
quoted, it will not be the Creator of all things that is the God that said to Moses that He was
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, but it will be He who has
been proved to you to have appeared to Abraham, ministering to the will of the Maker of
all things, and likewise carrying into execution His counsel in the judgment of Sodom; so
that, even though it be as you say, that there were two—an angel and God—he who has but
the smallest intelligence will not venture to assert that the Maker and Father of all things,
having left all supercelestial matters, was visible on a little portion of the earth.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “Since it has been previously proved that He who is called God and
Lord, and appeared to Abraham, received from the Lord, who is in the heavens, that which
He inflicted on the land of Sodom, even although an angel had accompanied the God who
appeared to Moses, we shall perceive that the God who communed with Moses from the
bush was not the Maker of all things, but He who has been shown to have manifested
Himself to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob; who also is called and is perceived to be the
Angel of God the Maker of all things, because He publishes to men the commands of the
Father and Maker of all things.”</p>
<p>And I replied, “Now assuredly, Trypho, I shall show that, in the vision of Moses, this
same One alone who is called an Angel, and who is God, appeared to and communed with
Moses. For the Scripture says thus: ‘The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of
fire from the bush; and he sees that the bush burns with fire, but the bush was not consumed.
And Moses said, I will turn aside and see this great sight, for the bush is not burnt. And
when the Lord saw that he is turning aside to behold, the Lord called to him out of the
bush.’400 In the same manner, therefore, in which the Scripture calls Him who appeared to
Jacob in the dream an Angel, then [says] that the same Angel who appeared in the dream
spoke to him,401 saying, ‘I am the God that appeared to thee when thou didst flee from the
face of Esau thy brother;’ and [again] says that, in the judgment which befell Sodom in the
days of Abraham, the Lord had inflicted the punishment402 of the Lord who [dwells] in the

heavens;—even so here, the Scripture, in announcing that the Angel of the Lord appeared
to Moses, and in afterwards declaring him to be Lord and God, speaks of the same One,

above the world, above whom there is no other [God].</p>

<head>Chapter LXI—Wisdom is begotten of the Father, as fire from fire.</head>
<p>“I shall give you another testimony, my friends,” said I, “from the Scriptures, that God
begat before all creatures a Beginning,403 [who was] a certain rational power [proceeding]
from Himself, who is called by the Holy Spirit, now the Glory of the Lord, now the Son,
again Wisdom, again an Angel, then God, and then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion
He calls Himself Captain, when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave
(Nun). For He can be called by all those names, since He ministers to the Father’s will, and
since He was begotten of the Father by an act of will;404 just as we see405 happening among
ourselves: for when we give out some word, we beget the word; yet not by abscission, so as
to lessen the word406 [which remains] in us, when we give it out: and just as we see also
happening in the case of a fire, which is not lessened when it has kindled [another], but remains
the same; and that which has been kindled by it likewise appears to exist by itself, not
diminishing that from which it was kindled. The Word of Wisdom, who is Himself this
God begotten of the Father of all things, and Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory
of the Begetter, will bear evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the following: ‘If I
shall declare to you what happens daily, I shall call to mind events from everlasting, and
review them. The Lord made me the beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting
He established me in the beginning, before He had made the earth, and before He had made
the deeps, before the springs of the waters had issued forth, before the mountains had been
established. Before all the hills He begets me. God made the country, and the desert, and
the highest inhabited places under the sky. When He made ready the heavens, I was along
with Him, and when He set up His throne on the winds: when He made the high clouds
strong, and the springs of the deep safe, when He made the foundations of the earth, I was
with Him arranging. I was that in which He rejoiced; daily and at all times I delighted in
His countenance, because He delighted in the finishing of the habitable world, and delighted
in the sons of men. Now, therefore, O son, hear me. Blessed is the man who shall listen to

<head>Chapter LXII.—The words “Let Us make man” agree with the testimony of
Proverbs.</head>
<p>“And the same sentiment was expressed, my friends, by the word of God [written] by
Moses, when it indicated to us, with regard to Him whom it has pointed out,409 that God
speaks in the creation of man with the very same design, in the following words: ‘Let Us
make man after our image and likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the
sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all
the creeping things that creep on the earth. And God created man: after the image of God
did He create him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and said, Increase
and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it.’410 And that you may not
change the [force of the] words just quoted, and repeat what your teachers assert,—either
that God said to Himself, ‘Let Us make,’ just as we, when about to do something, oftentimes
say to ourselves, ‘Let us make;’ or that God spoke to the elements, to wit, the earth and
other similar substances of which we believe man was formed, ‘Let Us make,’—I shall quote
again the words narrated by Moses himself, from which we can indisputably learn that
[God] conversed with some one who was numerically distinct from Himself, and also a rational
Being. These are the words: ‘And God said, Behold, Adam has become as one of us,
to know good and evil.’411 In saying, therefore, ‘as one of us,’ [Moses] has declared that
[there is a certain] number of persons associated with one another, and that they are at least
two. For I would not say that the dogma of that heresy412 which is said to be among you413
is true, or that the teachers of it can prove that [God] spoke to angels, or that the human
frame was the workmanship of angels. But this Offspring, which was truly brought forth
from the Father, was with the Father before all the creatures, and the Father communed
with Him; even as the Scripture by Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls

“in the beginning,” Moses indicated the Word, like many other writers. Hence also he says in Ap. i. 23, that

Menander and Saturninus invented, “exhorted themselves, saying, Let us make,” etc. (3.) The expression

Wisdom, was begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by God,
who has also declared this same thing in the revelation made by Joshua the son of Nave
(Nun). Listen, therefore, to the following from the book of Joshua, that what I say may become
manifest to you; it is this: ‘And it came to pass, when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted
up his eyes, and sees a man standing over against him. And Joshua approached to Him, and
said, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He said to him, I am Captain of the Lord’s
host: now have I come. And Joshua fell on his face on the ground, and said to Him, Lord,
what commandest Thou Thy servant? And the Lord’s Captain says to Joshua, Loose the
shoes off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. And Jericho was shut
up and fortified, and no one went out of it. And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I give into
thine hand Jericho, and its king, [and] its mighty men.’ ”414</p>

<head>Chapter LXIII.—It is proved that this God was incarnate.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “This point has been proved to me forcibly, and by many arguments,
my friend. It remains, then, to prove that He submitted to become man by the Virgin, according
to the will of His Father; and to be crucified, and to die. Prove also clearly, that after
this He rose again and ascended to heaven.”</p>
<p>I answered, “This, too, has been already demonstrated by me in the previously quoted
words of the prophecies, my friends; which, by recalling and expounding for your sakes, I
shall endeavour to lead you to agree with me also about this matter. The passage, then, which
Isaiah records, ‘Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken away from the
earth,’415—does it not appear to you to refer to One who, not having descent from men,
was said to be delivered over to death by God for the transgressions of the people?—of whose
blood, Moses (as I mentioned before), when speaking in parable, said, that He would wash
His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did not spring from the seed of man,
but from the will of God. And then, what is said by David, ‘In the splendours of Thy holiness
have I begotten Thee from the womb, before the morning star.416 The Lord hath sworn,
and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,’ 417—does
this not declare to you418 that [He was] from of old,419 and that the God and Father of all
things intended Him to be begotten by a human womb? And speaking in other words, which
also have been already quoted, [he says]: ‘Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre
of rectitude is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated
iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above
Thy fellows. [He hath anointed Thee] with myrrh, and oil, and cassia from Thy garments,
from the ivory palaces, whereby they made Thee glad. Kings’ daughters are in Thy honour.
The queen stood at Thy right hand, clad in garments embroidered with gold.420 Hearken,
O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy
father; and the King shall desire thy beauty: because he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship
Him.’421 Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him who established
these things,422 as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ. Moreover, that
the word of God speaks to those who believe in Him as being one soul, and one synagogue,

His name and partakes of His name (for we are all called Christians), is distinctly proclaimed

customs, when they speak thus:423 ‘Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear;

who are servants of God that made this same [Christ], do not require to confess or worship
Him.”</p>
<p>To this I replied, “If I were to be quarrelsome and light-minded like you, Trypho, I
would no longer continue to converse with you, since you are prepared not to understand
what has been said, but only to return some captious answer;424 but now, since I fear the
judgment of God, I do not state an untimely opinion concerning any one of your nation,
as to whether or not some of them may be saved by the grace of the Lord of Sabaoth.
Therefore, although you act wrongfully, I shall continue to reply to any proposition you
shall bring forward, and to any contradiction which you make; and, in fact, I do the very
same to all men of every nation, who wish to examine along with me, or make inquiry at
me, regarding this subject. Accordingly, if you had bestowed attention on the Scriptures
previously quoted by me, you would already have understood, that those who are saved of
your own nation are saved through this425 [man], and partake of His lot; and you would
not certainly have asked me about this matter. I shall again repeat the words of David previously
quoted by me, and beg of you to comprehend them, and not to act wrongfully, and
stir each other up to give merely some contradiction. The words which David speaks, then,
are these: ‘The Lord has reigned; let the nations be angry: [it is] He who sits upon the cherubim;
let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion; and He is high above all the nations.
Let them confess Thy great name, for it is fearful and holy; and the honour of the king loves
judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed
in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses
and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name; they called
on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spake to them; for they kept
His testimonies and His commandments which He gave them.’426 And from the other
words of David, also previously quoted, which you foolishly affirm refer to Solomon, [because]
inscribed for Solomon, it can be proved that they do not refer to Solomon, and that
this [Christ] existed before the sun, and that those of your nation who are saved shall be
saved through Him. [The words] are these: ‘O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy
righteousness unto the king’s son. He shall judge427 Thy people with righteousness, and

Thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little
hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the
needy, and shall abase the slanderer: and He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the
moon unto all generations;’ and so on until, ‘His name endureth before the sun, and all
tribes of the earth shalt be blessed in Him. All nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the
Lord, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things: and blessed be His glorious name
for ever and ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen, Amen.’428 And
you remember from other words also spoken by David, and which I have mentioned before,
how it is declared that He would come forth from the highest heavens, and again return to
the same places, in order that you may recognise Him as God coming forth from above,
and man living among men; and [how it is declared] that He will again appear, and they
who pierced Him shall see Him, and shall bewail Him. [The words] are these: ‘The heavens
declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. Day unto day uttereth
speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge: They are not speeches or words whose
voices are heard. Their sound has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the
ends of the world. In the sun has he set his habitation; and he, like a bridegroom going forth
from his chamber, will rejoice as a giant to run his race: from the highest heaven is his going
forth, and he returns to the highest heaven, and there is not one who shall be hidden from
his heat.’ ”429</p>

<head>Chapter LXV.—The Jew objects that God does not give His glory to another.
Justin explains the passage.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “Being shaken430 by so many Scriptures, I know not what to say about
the Scripture which Isaiah writes, in which God says that He gives not His glory to another,
speaking thus ‘I am the Lord God; this is my name; my glory will I not give to another, nor
my virtues.’ ”431</p>
<p>And I answered, “If you spoke these words, Trypho, and then kept silence in simplicity
and with no ill intent, neither repeating what goes before nor adding what comes after, you
must be forgiven; but if [you have done so] because you imagined that you could throw
doubt on the passage, in order that I might say the Scriptures contradicted each other, you
have erred. But I shall not venture to suppose or to say such a thing; and if a Scripture which
appears to be of such a kind be brought forward, and if there be a pretext [for saying] that
it is contrary [to some other], since I am entirely convinced that no Scripture contradicts
another, I shall admit rather that I do not understand what is recorded, and shall strive to
persuade those who imagine that the Scriptures are contradictory, to be rather of the same
opinion as myself. With what intent, then, you have brought forward the difficulty, God
knows. But I shall remind you of what the passage says, in order that you may recognise
even from this very [place] that God gives glory to His Christ alone. And I shall take up
some short passages, sirs, those which are in connection with what has been said by Trypho,
and those which are also joined on in consecutive order. For I will not repeat those of another
section, but those which are joined together in one. Do you also give me your attention.
[The words] are these: ‘Thus saith the Lord, the God that created the heavens, and made432
them fast, that established the earth, and that which is in it; and gave breath to the people
upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein: I the Lord God have called Thee in righteousness,
and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out
them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house.
I am the Lord God; this is my name: my glory will I not give to another, nor my virtues to
graven images. Behold, the former things are come to pass; new things which I announce,
and before they are announced they are made manifest to you. Sing unto the Lord a new
song: His sovereignty [is] from the end of the earth. [Sing], ye who descend into the sea,
and continually sail433 [on it]; ye islands, and inhabitants thereof. Rejoice, O wilderness,
and the villages thereof, and the houses; and the inhabitants of Cedar shall rejoice, and the

inhabitants of the rock shall cry aloud from the top of the mountains: they shall give glory
to God; they shall publish His virtues among the islands. The Lord God of hosts shall go
forth, He shall destroy war utterly, He shall stir up zeal, and He shall cry aloud to the enemies
with strength.’ ”434 And when I repeated this, I said to them, “Have you perceived, my
friends, that God says He will give Him whom He has established as a light of the Gentiles,
glory, and to no other; and not, as Trypho said, that God was retaining the glory to Himself?”
Then Trypho answered, “We have perceived this also; pass on therefore to the remainder
of the discourse.”</p>

<head>Chapter LXVI.—He proves from Isaiah that God was born from a virgin.</head>
<p>And I, resuming the discourse where I had left off435 at a previous stage, when proving
that He was born of a virgin, and that His birth of a virgin had been predicted by Isaiah,
quoted again the same prophecy. It is as follows ‘And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height. And Ahaz said
I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David;
Is it no small thing for you to contend with men? And how do you contend with the Lord?
Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall
bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat; before he
knows or prefers the evil he will choose out the good. For before the child knows ill or good,
he rejects evil by choosing out the good. For before the child knows how to call father or
mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoil of Samaria, in presence of
the king of Assyria. And the land shall be forsaken, which436 thou shalt with difficulty endure
in consequence of the presence of its two kings. But God shall bring on thee, and on thy
people, and on the house of thy father, days which have not yet come upon thee since the
day in which Ephraim took away from Judah the king of Assyria.’ ”437 And I continued:
“Now it is evident to all, that in the race of Abraham according to the flesh no one has been
born of a virgin, or is said to have been born [of a virgin], save this our Christ.”</p>

<head>Chapter LXVII.—Trypho compares Jesus with Perseus; and would prefer [to
say] that He was elected [to be Christ] on account of observance of the law. Justin
speaks of the law as formerly.</head>
<p>And Trypho answered, “The Scripture has not, ‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and
bear a son,’ but, ‘Behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son,’ and so on, as
you quoted. But the whole prophecy refers to Hezekiah, and it is proved that it was fulfilled
in him, according to the terms of this prophecy. Moreover, in the fables of those who are
called Greeks, it is written that Perseus was begotten of Danae, who was a virgin; he who
was called among them Zeus having descended on her in the form of a golden shower. And
you ought to feel ashamed when you make assertions similar to theirs, and rather [should]
say that this Jesus was born man of men. And if you prove from the Scriptures that He is
the Christ, and that on account of having led a life conformed to the law, and perfect, He
deserved the honour of being elected to be Christ, [it is well]; but do not venture to tell
monstrous phenomena, lest you be convicted of talking foolishly like the Greeks.”</p>
<p>Then I said to this, “Trypho, I wish to persuade you, and all men in short, of this, that
even though you talk worse things in ridicule and in jest, you will not move me from my
fixed design; but I shall always adduce from the words which you think can be brought
forward [by you] as proof [of your own views], the demonstration of what I have stated
along with the testimony of the Scriptures. You are not, however, acting fairly or truthfully
in attempting to undo those things in which there has been constantly agreement between
us; namely, that certain commands were instituted by Moses on account of the hardness of
your people’s hearts. For you said that, by reason of His living conformably to law, He was
elected and became Christ, if indeed He were proved to be so.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “You admitted438 to us that He was both circumcised, and observed
the other legal ceremonies ordained by Moses.”</p>
<p>And I replied, “I have admitted it, and do admit it: yet I have admitted that He endured
all these not as if He were justified by them, but completing the dispensation which His
Father, the Maker of all things, and Lord and God, wished Him [to complete]. For I admit
that He endured crucifixion and death, and the incarnation, and the suffering of as many
afflictions as your nation put upon Him. But since again you dissent from that to which you
but lately assented, Trypho, answer me: Are those righteous patriarchs who lived before
Moses, who observed none of those [ordinances] which, the Scripture shows, received the
commencement of [their] institution from Moses, saved, [and have they attained to] the
inheritance of the blessed?”</p>
<note type="footnote">438 We have not seen that Justin admitted this; but it is not to be supposed that the passage where he did
admit it has been lost, as Perionius suspected; for sometimes Justin refers to passages at other places, which he
did not relate in their own place. —Maranus.</note>

<pb n="619"/>
<p>And Trypho said, “The Scriptures compel me to admit it.”</p>
<p>“Likewise I again ask you,” said I, “did God enjoin your fathers to present the offerings
and sacrifices because He had need of them, or because of the hardness of their hearts and
tendency to idolatry?”</p>
<p>“The latter,” said he, “the Scriptures in like manner compel us to admit.”</p>
<p>“Likewise,” said I, “did not the Scriptures predict that God promised to dispense a new
covenant besides that which [was dispensed] in the mountain Horeb?”</p>
<p>This, too, he replied, had been predicted.</p>
<p>Then I said again, “Was not the old covenant laid on your fathers with fear and trembling,
so that they could not give ear to God?”</p>
<p>He admitted it.</p>
<p>“What then?” said I: “God promised that there would be another covenant, not like that
old one, and said that it would be laid on them without fear, and trembling, and lightnings,
and that it would be such as to show what kind of commands and deeds God knows to be
eternal and suited to every nation, and what commandments He has given, suiting them to
the hardness of your people’s hearts, as He exclaims also by the prophets.”</p>
<p>“To this also,” said he, “those who are lovers of truth and not lovers of strife must assuredly
assent.”</p>
<p>Then I replied, “I know not how you speak of persons very fond of strife, [since] you
yourself oftentimes were plainly acting in this very manner, frequently contradicting what
you had agreed to.”</p>

objection; he convicts the Jews of bad faith.</head>
<p>And Trypho said, “You endeavour to prove an incredible and well-nigh impossible
thing; [namely], that God endured to be born and become man.”</p>
<p>“If I undertook,” said I, “to prove this by doctrines or arguments of man, you should
not bear with me. But if I quote frequently Scriptures, and so many of them, referring to
this point, and ask you to comprehend them, you are hard-hearted in the recognition of the
mind and will of God. But if you wish to remain for ever so, I would not be injured at all;
and for ever retaining the same [opinions] which I had before I met with you, I shall leave
you.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “Look, my friend, you made yourself master of these [truths] with
much labour and toil.439 And we accordingly must diligently scrutinize all that we meet
with, in order to give our assent to those things which the Scriptures compel us [to believe].”</p>
<p>Then I said to this, “I do not ask you not to strive earnestly by all means, in making an
investigation of the matters inquired into; but [I ask you], when you have nothing to say,
not to contradict those things which you said you had admitted.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “So we shall endeavour to do.”</p>
<p>I continued again: “In addition to the questions I have just now put to you, I wish to
put more: for by means of these questions I shall strive to bring the discourse to a speedy
termination.”</p>
<p>And Trypho said, “Ask the questions.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “Do you think that any other one is said to be worthy of worship and called
Lord and God in the Scriptures, except the Maker of all, and Christ, who by so many
Scriptures was proved to you to have become man?”</p>
<p>And Trypho replied, “How can we admit this, when we have instituted so great an inquiry
as to whether there is any other than the Father alone?”</p>
<p>Then I again said, “I must ask you this also, that I may know whether or not you are of
a different opinion from that which you admitted some time ago.”440</p>
<p>He replied, “It is not, sir.”</p>

shall declare His generation?’ ought you not now to suppose that He is not the seed of a
human race?”</p>

<p>And Trypho said, “How then does the Word say to David, that out of his loins God
shall take to Himself a Son, and shall establish His kingdom, and shall set Him on the throne
of His glory?”</p>
<p>And I said, “Trypho, if the prophecy which Isaiah uttered, ‘Behold, the virgin shall
conceive,’ is said not to the house of David, but to another house of the twelve tribes, perhaps
the matter would have some difficulty; but since this prophecy refers to the house of David,
Isaiah has explained how that which was spoken by God to David in mystery would take
place. But perhaps you are not aware of this, my friends, that there were many sayings
written obscurely, or parabolically, or mysteriously, and symbolical actions, which the
prophets who lived after the persons who said or did them expounded.”</p>
<p>“Assuredly,” said Trypho.</p>
<p>“If therefore, I shall show that this prophecy of Isaiah refers to our Christ, and not to
Hezekiah, as you say, shall I not in this matter, too, compel you not to believe your teachers,
who venture to assert that the explanation which your seventy elders that were with Ptolemy
the king of the Egyptians gave, is untrue in certain respects? For some statements in the
Scriptures, which appear explicitly to convict them of a foolish and vain opinion, these they
venture to assert have not been so written. But other statements, which they fancy they can
distort and harmonize with human actions,441 these, they say, refer not to this Jesus Christ
of ours, but to him of whom they are pleased to explain them. Thus, for instance, they have
taught you that this Scripture which we are now discussing refers to Hezekiah, in which, as
I promised, I shall show they are wrong. And since they are compelled, they agree that some
Scriptures which we mention to them, and which expressly prove that Christ was to suffer,
to be worshipped, and [to be called] God, and which I have already recited to you, do refer
indeed to Christ, but they venture to assert that this man is not Christ. But they admit that
He will come to suffer, and to reign, and to be worshipped, and to be God;442 and this
opinion I shall in like manner show to be ridiculous and silly. But since I am pressed to answer

Bacchus, Hercules, and Æsculapius.</head>
<p>“Be well assured, then, Trypho,” I continued, “that I am established in the knowledge
of and faith in the Scriptures by those counterfeits which he who is called the devil is said
to have performed among the Greeks; just as some were wrought by the Magi in Egypt, and
others by the false prophets in Elijah’s days. For when they tell that Bacchus, son of Jupiter,
was begotten by [Jupiter’s] intercourse with Semele, and that he was the discoverer of the
vine; and when they relate, that being torn in pieces, and having died, he rose again, and
ascended to heaven; and when they introduce wine443 into his mysteries, do I not perceive
that [the devil] has imitated the prophecy announced by the patriarch Jacob, and recorded
by Moses? And when they tell that Hercules was strong, and travelled over all the world,
and was begotten by Jove of Alcmene, and ascended to heaven when he died, do I not perceive
that the Scripture which speaks of Christ, ‘strong as a giant to run his race,’444 has been in
like manner imitated? And when he [the devil] brings forward Æsculapius as the raiser of
the dead and healer of all diseases, may I not say that in this matter likewise he has imitated
the prophecies about Christ? But since I have not quoted to you such Scripture as tells that
Christ will do these things, I must necessarily remind you of one such: from which you can
understand, how that to those destitute of a knowledge of God, I mean the Gentiles, who,
‘having eyes, saw not, and having a heart, understood not,’ worshipping the images of wood,
[how even to them] Scripture prophesied that they would renounce these [vanities], and
hope in this Christ. It is thus written: ‘Rejoice, thirsty wilderness: let the wilderness be glad,
and blossom as the lily: the deserts of the Jordan shall both blossom and be glad: and the
glory of Lebanon was given to it, and the honour of Carmel. And my people shall see the
exaltation of the Lord, and the glory of God. Be strong, ye careless hands and enfeebled
knees. Be comforted, ye faint in soul: be strong, fear not. Behold, our God gives, and will
give, retributive judgment. He shall come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be
opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. Then the lame shall leap as an hart, and the
tongue of the stammerers shall be distinct: for water has broken forth in the wilderness, and
a valley in the thirsty land; and the parched ground shall become pools, and a spring of
water shall [rise up] in the thirsty land.’445 The spring of living water which gushed forth
from God in the land destitute of the knowledge of God, namely the land of the Gentiles,
was this Christ, who also appeared in your nation, and healed those who were maimed, and
deaf, and lame in body from their birth, causing them to leap, to hear, and to see, by His
word. And having raised the dead, and causing them to live, by His deeds He compelled the

men who lived at that time to recognise Him. But though they saw such works, they asserted
it was magical art. For they dared to call Him a magician, and a deceiver of the people. Yet
He wrought such works, and persuaded those who were [destined to] believe on Him; for
even if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be an observer of the doctrines delivered
by Him, He shall raise him up at His second advent perfectly sound, after He has

<head>Chapter LXX.—So also the mysteries of Mithras are distorted from the prophecies
of Daniel and Isaiah.</head>
<p>“And when those who record the mysteries of Mithras say that he was begotten of a
rock, and call the place where those who believe in him are initiated a cave, do I not perceive
here that the utterance of Daniel, that a stone without hands was cut out of a great mountain,
has been imitated by them, and that they have attempted likewise to imitate the whole of
Isaiah’s446 words?447 For they448 contrived that the words of righteousness be quoted also
by them.449 But I must repeat to you the words of Isaiah referred to, in order that from them
you may know that these things are so. They are these: ‘Hear, ye that are far off, what I have
done; those that are near shall know my might. The sinners in Zion are removed; trembling
shall seize the impious. Who shall announce to you the everlasting place? The man who
walks in righteousness, speaks in the right way, hates sin and unrighteousness, and keeps
his hands pure from bribes, stops the ears from hearing the unjust judgment of blood closes
the eyes from seeing unrighteousness: he shall dwell in the lofty cave of the strong rock.
Bread shall be given to him, and his water [shall be] sure. Ye shall see the King with glory,
and your eyes shall look far off. Your soul shall pursue diligently the fear of the Lord. Where
is the scribe? where are the counsellors? where is he that numbers those who are nourished,—
the small and great people? with whom they did not take counsel, nor knew the
depth of the voices, so that they heard not. The people who are become depreciated, and
there is no understanding in him who hears.’450 Now it is evident, that in this prophecy
[allusion is made] to the bread which our Christ gave us to eat,451 in remembrance of His
being made flesh for the sake of His believers, for whom also He suffered; and to the cup

and obvious. For since Mithras is the same as fire, it manifestly answers to the fire of which Isaiah speaks. And
since Justin reminded them who are initiated, that they are said to be initiated by Mithras himself, it was not
necessary to remind them that the words of Isaiah are imitated in this: “You shall see the King with glory.” Bread

name shall no more be remembered.’456 And since this passage from the sayings of
Jeremiah is still written in some copies [of the Scriptures] in the synagogues of the Jews
(for it is only a short time since they were cut out), and since from these words it is
demonstrated that the Jews deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and put Him
to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the slaughter, as was predicted
by Isaiah, and is here represented as a harmless lamb; but being in a difficulty about them,
they give themselves over to blasphemy. And again, from the sayings of the same Jeremiah
these have been cut out: ‘The Lord God remembered His dead people of Israel who lay in
the graves; and He descended to preach to them His own salvation.’457</p>

<head>Chapter LXXIII.—[The words] “From the wood” have been cut out of Ps. xcvi.</head>
<p>“And from the ninety-fifth (ninety-sixth) Psalm they have taken away this short saying
of the words of David: ‘From the wood.’458 For when the passage said, ‘Tell ye among the
nations, the Lord hath reigned from the wood,’ they have left, ‘Tell ye among the nations,
the Lord hath reigned.’ Now no one of your people has ever been said to have reigned as
God and Lord among the nations, with the exception of Him only who was crucified, of
whom also the Holy Spirit affirms in the same Psalm that He was raised again, and freed
from [the grave], declaring that there is none like Him among the gods of the nations: for
they are idols of demons. But I shall repeat the whole Psalm to you, that you may perceive
what has been said. It is thus: ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the
earth. Sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all people. For the Lord is great,
and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all the gods. For all the gods of the nations
are demons but the Lord made the heavens. Confession and beauty are in His presence;
holiness and magnificence are in His sanctuary. Bring to the Lord, O ye countries of the
nations, bring to the Lord glory and honour, bring to the Lord glory in His name. Take
sacrifices, and go into His courts; worship the Lord in His holy temple. Let the whole earth
be moved before Him: tell ye among the nations, the Lord hath reigned.459 For He hath established
the world, which shall not be moved; He shall judge the nations with equity. Let
the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad; let the sea and its fulness shake. Let the fields and
all therein be joyful. Let all the trees of the wood be glad before the Lord: for He comes, for
He comes to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with His truth.’ ”</p>
<p>Here Trypho remarked, “Whether [or not] the rulers of the people have erased any
portion of the Scriptures, as you affirm, God knows; but it seems incredible.”</p>
<p>“Assuredly,” said I, “it does seem incredible. For it is more horrible than the calf which
they made, when satisfied with manna on the earth; or than the sacrifice of children to
demons; or than the slaying of the prophets. But,” said I, “you appear to me not to have
heard the Scriptures which I said they had stolen away. For such as have been quoted are
more than enough to prove the points in dispute, besides those which are retained by us,460
and shall yet be brought forward.”</p>

the Lord,” etc.</head>
<p>Then Trypho said, “We know that you quoted these because we asked you. But it does
not appear to me that this Psalm which you quoted last from the words of David refers to
any other than the Father and Maker of the heavens and earth. You, however, asserted that
it referred to Him who suffered, whom you also are eagerly endeavouring to prove to be
Christ.”</p>
<p>And I answered, “Attend to me, I beseech you, while I speak of the statement which the
Holy Spirit gave utterance to in this Psalm; and you shall know that I speak not sinfully, and
that we461 are not really bewitched; for so you shall be enabled of yourselves to understand
many other statements made by the Holy Spirit. ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto
the Lord, all the earth: sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth His salvation
from day to day, His wonderful works among all people.’ He bids the inhabitants of all the
earth, who have known the mystery of this salvation, i.e., the suffering of Christ, by which
He saved them, sing and give praises to God the Father of all things, and recognise that He
is to be praised and feared, and that He is the Maker of heaven and earth, who effected this
salvation in behalf of the human race, who also was crucified and was dead, and who was
deemed worthy by Him (God) to reign over all the earth. As [is clearly seen462] also by the
land into which [He said] He would bring [your fathers]; [for He thus speaks]:463 ‘This
people [shall go a whoring after other gods], and shall forsake Me, and shall break my covenant
which I made with them in that day; and I will forsake them, and will turn away My
face from them; and they shall be devoured,464 and many evils and afflictions shall find
them out; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not amongst us, these
misfortunes have found us out. And I shall certainly turn away My face from them in that
day, on account of all the evils which they have committed, in that they have turned to
other gods.’465</p>

<head>Chapter LXXV.—It is proved that Jesus was the name of God in the book of
Exodus.</head>
<p>“Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the name of God Himself
which, He says, was not revealed to Abraham or to Jacob, was Jesus, and was declared
mysteriously through Moses. Thus it is written: ‘And the Lord spake to Moses, Say to this
people, Behold, I send My angel before thy face, to keep thee in the way, to bring thee into
the land which I have prepared for thee. Give heed to Him, and obey Him; do not disobey
Him. For He will not draw back from you; for My name is in Him.’466 Now understand that
He who led your fathers into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called Auses467
(Oshea). For if you shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him
who said to Moses, ‘for My name is in Him,’ was Jesus. For, indeed, He was also called Israel,
and Jacob’s name was changed to this also. Now Isaiah shows that those prophets who are
sent to publish tidings from God are called His angels and apostles. For Isaiah says in a
certain place, ‘Send me.’468 And that the prophet whose name was changed, Jesus [Joshua],
was strong and great, is manifest to all. If, then, we know that God revealed Himself in so
many forms to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, how are we at a loss, and do not believe
that, according to the will of the Father of all things, it was possible for Him to be born man
of the Virgin, especially after we have such469 Scriptures, from which it can be plainly perceived

<head>Chapter LXXVI.—From other passages the same majesty and government of
Christ are proved.</head>
<p>“For when Daniel speaks of ‘one like unto the Son of man’ who received the everlasting
kingdom, does he not hint at this very thing? For he declares that, in saying ‘like unto the
Son of man,’ He appeared, and was man, but not of human seed. And the same thing he
proclaimed in mystery when he speaks of this stone which was cut out without hands. For
the expression ‘it was cut out without hands’ signified that it is not a work of man, but [a
work] of the will of the Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when
Isaiah says, ‘Who shall declare His generation?’ he meant that His descent could not be declared.
Now no one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared. And when
Moses says that He will wash His garments in the blood of the grape, does not this signify
what I have now often told you is an obscure prediction, namely, that He had blood, but
not from men; just as not man, but God, has begotten the blood of the vine? And when
Isaiah calls Him the Angel of mighty counsel,470 did he not foretell Him to be the Teacher
of those truths which He did teach when He came [to earth]? For He alone taught openly
those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall
be well-pleasing to Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men
or angels, when He said: ‘They shall come from the east [and from the west471], and shall
sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the children
of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.’472 And, ‘Many shall say to Me in that
day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast out demons in Thy
name? And I will say to them, Depart from Me.’473 Again, in other words, by which He shall
condemn those who are unworthy of salvation, He said, ‘Depart into outer darkness, which
the Father has prepared for Satan and his, angels.’474 And again, in other words, He said, ‘I
give unto you power to tread on serpents, and on scorpions, and on scolopendras, and on
all the might of the enemy.’475 And now we, who believe on our Lord Jesus, who was crucified
under Pontius Pilate, when we exorcise all demons and evil spirits, have them subjected to
us. For if the prophets declared obscurely that Christ would suffer, and thereafter be Lord
of all, yet that [declaration] could not be understood by any man until He Himself persuaded
the apostles that such statements were expressly related in the Scriptures. For He exclaimed

<head>Chapter LXXVII.—He returns to explain the prophecy of Isaiah.</head>
<p>Then Trypho said, “I admit that such and so great arguments are sufficient to persuade
one; but I wish [you] to know that I ask you for the proof which you have frequently proposed
to give me. Proceed then to make this plain to us, that we may see how you prove that that
[passage] refers to this Christ of yours. For we assert that the prophecy relates to Hezekiah.”
And I replied, “I shall do as you wish. But show me yourselves first of all how it is said of
Hezekiah, that before he knew how to call father or mother, he received the power of
Damascus and the spoils of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria. For it will not
be conceded to you, as you wish to explain it, that Hezekiah waged war with the inhabitants
of Damascus and Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria. ‘For before the child knows
how to call father or mother,’ the prophetic word said, ‘He shall take the power of Damascus
and spoils of Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria.’ For if the Spirit of prophecy had
not made the statement with an addition, ‘Before the child knows how to call father or
mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,’ but had only said, ‘And
shall bear a son, and he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,’ then you
might say that God foretold that he would take these things, since He foreknew it. But now
the prophecy has stated it with this addition: ‘Before the child knows how to call father or
mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria.’ And you cannot prove
that such a thing ever happened to any one among the Jews. But we are able to prove that
it happened in the case of our Christ. For at the time of His birth, Magi who came from
Arabia worshipped Him, coming first to Herod, who then was sovereign in your land, and
whom the Scripture calls king of Assyria on account of his ungodly and sinful character.
For you know,” continued I, “that the Holy Spirit oftentimes announces such events by
parables and similitudes; just as He did towards all the people in Jerusalem, frequently saying
to them, ‘Thy father is an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.’478</p>

<pb n="634"/>
<head>Chapter LXXVIII.—He proves that this prophecy harmonizes with Christ alone,
from what is afterwards written.</head>
<p>“Now this king Herod, at the time when the Magi came to him from Arabia, and said
they knew from a star which appeared in the heavens that a King had been born in your
country, and that they had come to worship Him, learned from the elders of your people
that it was thus written regarding Bethlehem in the prophet: ‘And thou, Bethlehem, in the
land of Judah, art by no means least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall go
forth the leader who shall feed my people.’479 Accordingly the Magi from Arabia came to
Bethlehem and worshipped the Child, and presented Him with gifts, gold and frankincense,
and myrrh; but returned not to Herod, being warned in a revelation after worshipping the
Child in Bethlehem. And Joseph, the spouse of Mary, who wished at first to put away his
betrothed Mary, supposing her to be pregnant by intercourse with a man, i.e., from fornication,
was commanded in a vision not to put away his wife; and the angel who appeared to
him told him that what is in her womb is of the Holy Ghost. Then he was afraid, and did
not put her away; but on the occasion of the first census which was taken in Judæa, under
Cyrenius, he went up from Nazareth, where he lived, to Bethlehem, to which he belonged,
to be enrolled; for his family was of the tribe of Judah, which then inhabited that region.
Then along with Mary he is ordered to proceed into Egypt, and remain there with the Child
until another revelation warn them to return into Judæa. But when the Child was born in
Bethlehem, since Joseph could not find a lodging in that village, he took up his quarters in
a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and
placed Him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found Him. I have repeated
to you,” I continued, “what Isaiah foretold about the sign which foreshadowed the
cave; but for the sake of those who have come with us to-day, I shall again remind you of
the passage.” Then I repeated the passage from Isaiah which I have already written, adding
that, by means of those words, those who presided over the mysteries of Mithras were stirred
up by the devil to say that in a place, called among them a cave, they were initiated by him.480
“So Herod, when the Magi from Arabia did not return to him, as he had asked them to do,
but had departed by another way to their own country, according to the commands laid on
them; and when Joseph, with Mary and the Child, had now gone into Egypt, as it was revealed
to them to do; as he did not know the Child whom the Magi had gone to worship, ordered
simply the whole of the children then in Bethlehem to be massacred. And Jeremiah prophesied
that this would happen, speaking by the Holy Ghost thus: ‘A voice was heard in Ramah,
lamentation and much wailing, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be
<note type="footnote">479 Mic. v. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">480 Text has, by “them;” but Maranus says the artifice lay in the priest’s compelling the initiated to say that
Mithras himself was the initiator in the cave.</note>

<pb n="635"/>
comforted, because they are not.’481 Therefore, on account of the voice which would be
heard from Ramah, i.e., from Arabia (for there is in Arabia at this very time a place called
Rama), wailing would come on the place where Rachel the wife of Jacob called Israel, the
holy patriarch, has been buried, i.e., on Bethlehem; while the women weep for their own
slaughtered children, and have no consolation by reason of what has happened to them.
For that expression of Isaiah, ‘He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,’
foretold that the power of the evil demon that dwelt in Damascus should be overcome by
Christ as soon as He was born; and this is proved to have happened. For the Magi, who were
held in bondage482 for the commission of all evil deeds through the power of that demon,
by coming to worship Christ, shows that they have revolted from that dominion which held
them captive; and this [dominion] the Scripture has showed us to reside in Damascus.
Moreover, that sinful and unjust power is termed well in parable, Samaria.483 And none of
you can deny that Damascus was, and is, in the region of Arabia, although now it belongs
to what is called Syrophoenicia. Hence it would be becoming for you, sirs, to learn what you
have not perceived, from those who have received grace from God, namely, from us Christians;
and not to strive in every way to maintain your own doctrines, dishonouring those
of God. Therefore also this grace has been transferred to us, as Isaiah says, speaking to the
following effect: ‘This people draws near to Me, they honour Me with their lips, but their
heart is far from Me; but in vain they worship Me, teaching the commands and doctrines
of men. Therefore, behold, I will proceed484 to remove this people, and I shall remove them;
and I shall take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nothing the understanding
of the prudent men.’ ”485</p>

<p>On this, Trypho, who was somewhat angry, but respected the Scriptures, as was manifest
from his countenance, said to me, “The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions
are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies,
for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God.”</p>
<p>And I, wishing to get him to listen to me, answered in milder tones, thus: “I admire, sir,
this piety of yours; and I pray that you may entertain the same disposition towards Him to
whom angels are recorded to minister, as Daniel says; for [one] like the Son of man is led
to the Ancient of days, and every kingdom is given to Him for ever and ever. But that you
may know, sir,” continued I, “that it is not our audacity which has induced us to adopt this
exposition, which you reprehend, I shall give you evidence from Isaiah himself; for he affirms
that evil angels have dwelt and do dwell in Tanis, in Egypt. These are [his] words: ‘Woe to
the rebellious children! Thus saith the Lord, You have taken counsel, but not through Me;
and [made] agreements, but not through My Spirit, to add sins to sins; who have sinned486
in going down to Egypt (but they have not inquired at Me), that they may be assisted by
Pharaoh, and be covered with the shadow of the Egyptians. For the shadow of Pharaoh shall
be a disgrace to you, and a reproach to those who trust in the Egyptians; for the princes in
Tanis487 are evil angels. In vain will they labour for a people which will not profit them by
assistance, but [will be] for a disgrace and a reproach [to them].’488 And, further, Zechariah
tells, as you yourself have related, that the devil stood on the right hand of Joshua the priest,
to resist him; and [the Lord] said, ‘The Lord, who has taken489 Jerusalem, rebuke thee.’490
And again, it is written in Job,491 as you said yourself, how that the angels came to stand
before the Lord, and the devil came with them. And we have it recorded by Moses in the
beginning of Genesis, that the serpent beguiled Eve, and was cursed. And we know that in
Egypt there were magicians who emulated492 the mighty power displayed by God through
the faithful servant Moses. And you are aware that David said, ‘The gods of the nations are
demons.’ ”493</p>

another. I admitted to you formerly,494 that I and many others are of this opinion, and
[believe] that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware;495 but, on the other hand, I

a statement, so far as I can, of all the arguments which have passed between us; in which I
shall record myself as admitting the very same things which I admit to you.496 For I choose
to follow not men or men’s doctrines, but God and the doctrines [delivered] by Him. For
if you have fallen in with some who are called Christians, but who do not admit this
[truth],497 and venture to blaspheme the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that their souls, when they

the exception of human will; the Essenes making no exceptions, and submitting all to God. I believe therefore
that the Genistæ were so called because they believed the world to be in general governed by God; the Meristæ,
because they believed that a fate or providence belonged to each man.</note>

produce of them, and drink the wine. They shall not build, and others inhabit; they shall
not plant, and others eat. For according to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my
people; the works of their toil shall abound.504 Mine elect shall not toil fruitlessly, or beget
children to be cursed; for they shall be a seed righteous and blessed by the Lord, and their
offspring with them. And it shall come to pass, that before they call I will hear; while they
are still speaking, I shall say, What is it? Then shall the wolves and the lambs feed together,
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent [shall eat] earth as bread. They shall
not hurt or maltreat each other on the holy mountain, saith the Lord.’505 Now we have understood
that the expression used among these words, ‘According to the days of the tree [of
life506] shall be the days of my people; the works of their toil shall abound’ obscurely predicts
a thousand years. For as Adam was told that in the day he ate of the tree he would die, we
know that he did not complete a thousand years. We have perceived, moreover, that the
expression, ‘The day of the Lord is as a thousand years,’507 is connected with this subject.
And further, there was a certain man with us, whose name was John, one of the apostles of
Christ, who prophesied, by a revelation that was made to him, that those who believed in
our Christ would dwell508 a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that thereafter the general,

<head>Chapter LXXXII.—The prophetical gifts of the Jews were transferred to the
Christians.</head>
<p>“For the prophetical gifts remain with us, even to the present time. And hence you ought
to understand that [the gifts] formerly among your nation have been transferred to us. And
just as there were false prophets contemporaneous with your holy prophets, so are there
now many false teachers amongst us, of whom our Lord forewarned us to beware; so that
in no respect are we deficient, since we know that He foreknew all that would happen to us
after His resurrection from the dead and ascension to heaven. For He said we would be put
to death, and hated for His name’s sake; and that many false prophets and false Christs
would appear in His name, and deceive many: and so has it come about. For many have
taught godless, blasphemous, and unholy doctrines, forging them in His name; have taught,
too, and even yet are teaching, those things which proceed from the unclean spirit of the
devil, and which were put into their hearts. Therefore we are most anxious that you be
persuaded not to be misled by such persons, since we know that every one who can speak
the truth, and yet speaks it not, shall be judged by God, as God testified by Ezekiel, when
He said, ‘I have made thee a watchman to the house of Judah. If the sinner sin, and thou
warn him not, he himself shall die in his sin; but his blood will I require at thine hand. But
if thou warn him, thou shalt be innocent.’510 And on this account we are, through fear, very
earnest in desiring to converse [with men] according to the Scriptures, but not from love
of money, or of glory, or of pleasure. For no man can convict us of any of these [vices]. No
more do we wish to live like the rulers of your people, whom God reproaches when He says,
‘Your rulers are companions of thieves, lovers of bribes, followers of the rewards.’511 Now,
if you know certain amongst us to be of this sort, do not for their sakes blaspheme the
Scriptures and Christ, and do not assiduously strive to give falsified interpretations.</p>

<head>Chapter LXXXIII.—It is proved that the Psalm, “The Lord said to My Lord,”
etc., does not suit Hezekiah.</head>
<p>“For your teachers have ventured to refer the passage, ‘The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at
my right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,’ to Hezekiah; as if he were requested
to sit on the right side of the temple, when the king of Assyria sent to him and threatened
him; and he was told by Isaiah not to be afraid. Now we know and admit that what Isaiah
said took place; that the king of Assyria desisted from waging war against Jerusalem in
Hezekiah’s days, and the angel of the Lord slew about 185,000 of the host of the Assyrians.
But it is manifest that the Psalm does not refer to him. For thus it is written, ‘The Lord says
to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. He shall send
forth a rod of power over512 Jerusalem, and it shall rule in the midst of Thine513 enemies.
In the splendour of the saints before the morning star have I begotten Thee. The Lord hath
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.’ Who
does not admit, then, that Hezekiah is no priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek?
And who does not know that he is not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not know
that he neither sent a rod of power into Jerusalem, nor ruled in the midst of his enemies;
but that it was God who averted from him the enemies, after he mourned and was afflicted?
But our Jesus, who has not yet come in glory, has sent into Jerusalem a rod of power, namely,
the word of calling and repentance [meant] for all nations over which demons held sway,
as David says, ‘The gods of the nations are demons.’ And His strong word has prevailed on
many to forsake the demons whom they used to serve, and by means of it to believe in the
Almighty God because the gods of the nations are demons.514 And we mentioned formerly
that the statement, ‘In the splendour of the saints before the morning star have I begotten
Thee from the womb,’ is made to Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter LXXXIV.—That prophecy, “Behold, a virgin,” etc., suits Christ alone.</head>
<p>“Moreover, the prophecy, ‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,’ was uttered
respecting Him. For if He to whom Isaiah referred was not to be begotten of a virgin, of
whom515 did the Holy Spirit declare, ‘Behold, the Lord Himself shall give us a sign: behold,
the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son?’ For if He also were to be begotten of sexual intercourse,
like all other first-born sons, why did God say that He would give a sign which is
not common to all the first-born sons? But that which is truly a sign, and which was to be
made trustworthy to mankind,—namely, that the first-begotten of all creation should become
incarnate by the Virgin’s womb, and be a child,—this he anticipated by the Spirit of
prophecy, and predicted it, as I have repeated to you, in various ways; in order that, when
the event should take place, it might be known as the operation of the power and will of the
Maker of all things; just as Eve was made from one of Adam’s ribs, and as all living beings
were created in the beginning by the word of God. But you in these matters venture to pervert
the expositions which your elders that were with Ptolemy king of Egypt gave forth, since
you assert that the Scripture is not so as they have expounded it, but says, ‘Behold, the young
woman shall conceive,’ as if great events were to be inferred if a woman should beget from
sexual intercourse: which indeed all young women, with the exception of the barren, do;
but even these, God, if He wills, is able to cause [to bear]. For Samuel’s mother, who was
barren, brought forth by the will of God; and so also the wife of the holy patriarch Abraham;
and Elisabeth, who bore John the Baptist, and other such. So that you must not suppose
that it is impossible for God to do anything He wills. And especially when it was predicted
that this would take place, do not venture to pervert or misinterpret the prophecies, since
you will injure yourselves alone, and will not harm God.</p>

gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may enter,’516
as if it referred likewise to Hezekiah, and others of you [expound it] of Solomon; but neither
to the latter nor to the former, nor, in short, to any of your kings, can it be proved to have
reference, but to this our Christ alone, who appeared without comeliness, and inglorious,
as Isaiah and David and all the Scriptures said; who is the Lord of hosts, by the will of the
Father who conferred on Him [the dignity]; who also rose from the dead, and ascended to
heaven, as the Psalm and the other Scriptures manifested when they announced Him to be
Lord of hosts; and of this you may, if you will, easily be persuaded by the occurrences which
take place before your eyes. For every demon, when exorcised in the name of this very Son
of God —who is the First-born of every creature, who became man by the Virgin, who
suffered, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate by your nation, who died, who rose from
the dead, and ascended into heaven —is overcome and subdued. But though you exorcise
any demon in the name of any of those who were amongst you—either kings, or righteous
men, or prophets, or patriarchs—it will not be subject to you. But if any of you exorcise it
in [the name of] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, it will
perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly your exorcists, I have said,517 make use of craft
when they exorcise, even as the Gentiles do, and employ fumigations and incantations.518
But that they are angels and powers whom the word of prophecy by David [commands] to
lift up the gates, that He who rose from the dead, Jesus Christ, the Lord of hosts, according
to the will of the Father, might enter, the word of David has likewise showed; which I shall
again recall to your attention for the sake of those who were not with us yesterday, for whose
benefit, moreover, I sum up many things I said yesterday. And now, if I say this to you, although
I have repeated it many times, I know that it is not absurd so to do. For it is a ridiculous
thing to see the sun, and the moon, and the other stars, continually keeping the same
course, and bringing round the different seasons; and to see the computer who may be asked
how many are twice two, because he has frequently said that they are four, not ceasing to
say again that they are four; and equally so other things, which are confidently admitted, to
be continually mentioned and admitted in like manner; yet that he who founds his discourse

The passage, then, by which I proved that God reveals that there are both angels and hosts

all His angels: praise Him, all His hosts.’ ”519</p>

Mnaseas, said, “We are greatly pleased that you undertake to repeat the same things on our

commanded [us] to love even [our] enemies, as was predicted by Isaiah in many passages,
in which also is contained the mystery of our own regeneration, as well, in fact, as the regeneration
of all who expect that Christ will appear in Jerusalem, and by their works endeavour
earnestly to please Him. These are the words spoken by Isaiah: ‘Hear the word of the Lord,
ye that tremble at His word. Say, our brethren, to them that hate you and detest you, that
the name of the Lord has been glorified. He has appeared to your joy, and they shall be
ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple,520 a voice of the Lord who
rendereth recompense to the proud. Before she that travailed brought forth, and before the
pains of labour came, she brought forth a male child. Who hath heard such a thing? and
who hath seen such a thing? has the earth brought forth in one day? and has she produced
a nation at once? for Zion has travailed and borne her children. But I have given such an
expectation even to her that does not bring forth, said the Lord. Behold, I have made her
that begetteth, and her that is barren, saith the Lord. Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and hold a joyous
assembly, all ye that love her. Be glad, all ye that mourn for her, that ye may suck and be
filled with the breast of her consolation, that having suck ye may be delighted with the entrance

<head>Chapter LXXXVI.—There are various figures in the Old Testament of the wood
of the cross by which Christ reigned.</head>
<p>And when I had quoted this, I added, “Hear, then, how this Man, of whom the Scriptures
declare that He will come again in glory after His crucifixion, was symbolized both by the
tree of life, which was said to have been planted in paradise, and by those events which
should happen to all the just. Moses was sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the
people; and with this in his hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he
saw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah,
which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, caused
the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. With his rod the
same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the
Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the Father, we have
proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured oil on a stone in the same place, is
testified to by the very God who appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God
who appeared to him. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also
proved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil, or of stacte,522 or
of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also proved,523
inasmuch as the word says: ‘Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil
of gladness above Thy fellows.’524 For indeed all kings and anointed persons obtained from
Him their share in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the
Father the titles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which
He bears or did bear. Aaron’s rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the high priest.
Isaiah prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ.
And David says that the righteous man is ‘like the tree that is planted by the channels of
waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose leaf should not fade.’525 Again,
the righteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to Abraham,
as it is written, near the oak in Mamre. The people found seventy willows and twelve springs
after crossing the Jordan.526 David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff.
Elisha, by casting a stick527 into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with
which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they
wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being

<head>Chapter LXXXVII.—Trypho maintains in objection these words: “And shall
rest on Him,” etc. They are explained by Justin.</head>
<p>Hereupon Trypho, after I had spoken these words, said, “Do not now suppose that I
am endeavouring, by asking what I do ask, to overturn the statements you have made; but
I wish to receive information respecting those very points about which I now inquire. Tell
me, then, how, when the Scripture asserts by Isaiah, ‘There shall come forth a rod from the
root of Jesse; and a flower shall grow up from the root of Jesse; and the Spirit of God shall
rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and piety: and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him:’528
(now you admitted to me,” continued he, “that this referred to Christ, and you maintain
Him to be pre-existent God, and having become incarnate by God’s will, to be born man
by the Virgin:) how He can be demonstrated to have been pre-existent, who is filled with
the powers of the Holy Ghost, which the Scripture by Isaiah enumerates, as if He were in
lack of them?”</p>
<p>Then I replied, “You have inquired most discreetly and most prudently, for truly there
does seem to be a difficulty; but listen to what I say, that you may perceive the reason of this
also. The Scripture says that these enumerated powers of the Spirit have come on Him, not
because He stood in need of them, but because they would rest in Him, i.e., would find their
accomplishment in Him, so that there would be no more prophets in your nation after the
ancient custom: and this fact you plainly perceive. For after Him no prophet has arisen
among you. Now, that [you may know that] your prophets, each receiving some one or two
powers from God, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the Scriptures, attend
to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed the spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of
understanding and counsel, Moses that of might and piety, Elijah that of fear, and Isaiah
that of knowledge; and so with the others: each possessed one power, or one joined alternately
with another; also Jeremiah, and the twelve [prophets], and David, and, in short, the rest
who existed amongst you. Accordingly He529 rested, i.e., ceased, when He came, after whom,
in the times of this dispensation wrought out by Him amongst men,530 it was requisite that
such gifts should cease from you; and having received their rest in Him, should again, as
had been predicted, become gifts which, from the grace of His Spirit’s power, He imparts
to those who believe in Him, according as He deems each man worthy thereof. I have already
said, and do again say, that it had been prophesied that this would be done by Him after
His ascension to heaven. It is accordingly said,531 ‘He ascended on high, He led captivity

<head>Chapter LXXXVIII.—Christ has not received the Holy Spirit on account of
poverty.</head>
<p>“Now, it is possible to see amongst us women and men who possess gifts of the Spirit
of God; so that it was prophesied that the powers enumerated by Isaiah would come upon
Him, not because He needed power, but because these would not continue after Him. And
let this be a proof to you, namely, what I told you was done by the Magi from Arabia, who
as soon as the Child was born came to worship Him, for even at His birth He was in possession
of His power; and as He grew up like all other men, by using the fitting means, He assigned
its own [requirements] to each development, and was sustained by all kinds of
nourishment, and waited for thirty years, more or less, until John appeared before Him as
the herald of His approach, and preceded Him in the way of baptism, as I have already
shown. And then, when Jesus had gone to the river Jordan, where John was baptizing, and
when He had stepped into the water, a fire533 was kindled in the Jordan; and when He came
out of the water, the Holy Ghost lighted on Him like a dove, [as] the apostles of this very
Christ of ours wrote. Now, we know that he did not go to the river because He stood in need
of baptism, or of the descent of the Spirit like a dove; even as He submitted to be born and
to be crucified, not because He needed such things, but because of the human race, which
from Adam had fallen under the power of death and the guile of the serpent, and each one
of which had committed personal transgression. For God, wishing both angels and men,
who were endowed with free-will, and at their own disposal, to do whatever He had
strengthened each to do, made them so, that if they chose the things acceptable to Himself,
He would keep them free from death and from punishment; but that if they did evil, He
would punish each as He sees fit. For it was not His entrance into Jerusalem sitting on an
ass, which we have showed was prophesied, that empowered Him to be Christ, but it furnished
men with a proof that He is the Christ; just as it was necessary in the time of John
that men have proof, that they might know who is Christ. For when John remained534 by
the Jordan, and preached the baptism of repentance, wearing only a leathern girdle and a
vesture made of camels’ hair, eating nothing but locusts and wild honey, men supposed him
to be Christ; but he cried to them, ‘I am not the Christ, but the voice of one crying; for He
that is stronger than I shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.’535 And when Jesus

without comeliness, as the Scriptures declared; and He was deemed a carpenter (for He was
in the habit of working as a carpenter when among men, making ploughs and yokes; by
which He taught the symbols of righteousness and an active life); but then the Holy Ghost,
and for man’s sake, as I formerly stated, lighted on Him in the form of a dove, and there
came at the same instant from the heavens a voice, which was uttered also by David when
he spoke, personating Christ, what the Father would say to Him: ‘Thou art My Son: this day
have I begotten Thee;’536 [the Father] saying that His generation would take place for men,

the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called, has inclined me very
strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ should be so shamefully crucified, this we
are in doubt about. For whosoever is crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am
exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the Scriptures announce
that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn if you can prove it to us whether it was by the
suffering cursed in the law.”</p>
<p>I replied to him, “If Christ was not to suffer, and the prophets had not foretold that He
would be led to death on account of the sins of the people, and be dishonoured and scourged,
and reckoned among the transgressors, and as a sheep be led to the slaughter, whose generation,
the prophet says, no man can declare, then you would have good cause to wonder.
But if these are to be characteristic of Him and mark Him out to all, how is it possible for
us to do anything else than believe in Him most confidently? And will not as many as have

<p>“When the people,” replied I, “waged war with Amalek, and the son of Nave (Nun) by
name Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, Moses himself prayed to God, stretching out both hands,
and Hur with Aaron supported them during the whole day, so that they might not hang
down when he got wearied. For if he gave up any part of this sign, which was an imitation
of the cross, the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained
in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the
cross. For it was not because Moses so prayed that the people were stronger, but because,
while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the battle, he himself
made the sign of the cross. For who of you knows not that the prayer of one who accompanies
it with lamentation and tears, with the body prostrate, or with bended knees, propitiates
God most of all? But in such a manner neither he nor any other one, while sitting on a stone,
prayed. Nor even the stone symbolized Christ, as I have shown.</p>

<head>Chapter XCI.—The cross was foretold in the blessings of Joseph, and in the
serpent that was lifted up.</head>
<p>“And God by Moses shows in another way the force of the mystery of the cross, when
He said in the blessing wherewith Joseph was blessed, ‘From the blessing of the Lord is his
land; for the seasons of heaven, and for the dews, and for the deep springs from beneath,
and for the seasonable fruits of the sun,539 and for the coming together of the months, and
for the heights of the everlasting mountains, and for the heights of the hills, and for the everflowing
rivers, and for the fruits of the fatness of the earth; and let the things accepted by
Him who appeared in the bush come on the head and crown of Joseph. Let him be glorified
among his brethren;540 his beauty is [like] the firstling of a bullock; his horns the horns of
an unicorn: with these shall he push the nations from one end of the earth to another.’541
Now, no one could say or prove that the horns of an unicorn represent any other fact or
figure than the type which portrays the cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from
which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it,
and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn. And the part which
is fixed in the centre, on which are suspended those who are crucified, also stands out like
a horn; and it also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the other horns. And the expression,
‘With these shall he push as with horns the nations from one end of the earth to
another,’ is indicative of what is now the fact among all the nations. For some out of all the
nations, through the power of this mystery, having been so pushed, that is, pricked in their
hearts, have turned from vain idols and demons to serve God. But the same figure is revealed
for the destruction and condemnation of the unbelievers; even as Amalek was defeated and
Israel victorious when the people came out of Egypt, by means of the type of the stretching
out of Moses’ hands, and the name of Jesus (Joshua), by which the son of Nave (Nun) was
called. And it seems that the type and sign, which was erected to counteract the serpents
which bit Israel, was intended for the salvation of those who believe that death was declared
to come thereafter on the serpent through Him that would be crucified, but salvation to
those who had been bitten by him and had betaken themselves to Him that sent His Son
into the world to be crucified.542 For the Spirit of prophecy by Moses did not teach us to
believe in the serpent, since it shows us that he was cursed by God from the beginning; and

<head>Chapter XCII.—Unless the scriptures be understood through God’s great grace,
God will not appear to have taught always the same righteousness.</head>
<p>“Unless, therefore, a man by God’s great grace receives the power to understand what
has been said and done by the prophets, the appearance of being able to repeat the words
or the deeds will not profit him, if he cannot explain the argument of them. And will they
not assuredly appear contemptible to many, since they are related by those who understood
them not? For if one should wish to ask you why, since Enoch, Noah with his sons, and all
others in similar circumstances, who neither were circumcised nor kept the Sabbath, pleased
God, God demanded by other leaders, and by the giving of the law after the lapse of so many
generations, that those who lived between the times of Abraham and of Moses be justified
by circumcision, and that those who lived after Moses be justified by circumcision and the
other ordinances—to wit, the Sabbath, and sacrifices, and libations,543 and offerings; [God
will be slandered] unless you show, as I have already said, that God who foreknew was aware
that your nation would deserve expulsion from Jerusalem, and that none would be permitted
to enter into it. (For544 you are not distinguished in any other way than by the fleshly circumcision,
as I remarked previously. For Abraham was declared by God to be righteous,
not on account of circumcision, but on account of faith. For before he was circumcised the
following statement was made regarding him: ‘Abraham believed God, and it was accounted
unto him for righteousness.’545 And we, therefore, in the uncircumcision of our flesh, believing
God through Christ, and having that circumcision which is of advantage to us who
have acquired it —namely, that of the heart—we hope to appear righteous before and wellpleasing
to God: since already we have received His testimony through the words of the
prophets.) [And, further, God will be slandered unless you show] that you were commanded
to observe the Sabbath, and to present offerings, and that the Lord submitted to have a place
called by the name of God, in order that, as has been said, you might not become impious
and godless by worshipping idols and forgetting God, as indeed you do always appear to
have been. (Now, that God enjoined the ordinances of Sabbaths and offerings for these
reasons, I have proved in what I previously remarked; but for the sake of those who came
to-day, I wish to repeat nearly the whole.) For if this is not the case, God will be slandered,546
as having no foreknowledge, and as not teaching all men to know and to do the same acts
of righteousness (for many generations of men appear to have existed before Moses); and
the Scripture is not true which affirms that ‘God is true and righteous, and all His ways are

always willing that such even as you be neither foolish nor lovers of yourselves, in order that
you may obtain the salvation of Christ,547 who pleased God, and received testimony from
Him, as I have already said, by alleging proof from the holy words of prophecy.</p>

<head>Chapter XCIII.—The same kind of righteousness is bestowed on all. Christ
comprehends it in two precepts.</head>
<p>“For [God] sets before every race of mankind that which is always and universally just,
as well as all righteousness; and every race knows that adultery, and fornication, and homicide,
548 and such like, are sinful; and though they all commit such practices, yet they do
not escape from the knowledge that they act unrighteously whenever they so do, with the
exception of those who are possessed with an unclean spirit, and who have been debased
by education, by wicked customs, and by sinful institutions, and who have lost, or rather
quenched and put under, their natural ideas. For we may see that such persons are unwilling
to submit to the same things which they inflict upon others, and reproach each other with
hostile consciences for the acts which they perpetrate. And hence I think that our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ spoke well when He summed up all righteousness and piety in two
commandments. They are these: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.’549 For the man who loves God with all
the heart, and with all the strength, being filled with a God-fearing mind, will reverence no
other god; and since God wishes it, he would reverence that angel who is beloved by the
same Lord and God. And the man who loves his neighbour as himself will wish for him the
same good things that he wishes for himself, and no man will wish evil things for himself.
Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would pray and labour that his neighbour may be
possessed of the same benefits as himself. Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that
similarly-affectioned and reasonable being—man. Therefore, since all righteousness is divided
into two branches, namely, in so far as it regards God and men, whoever, says the Scripture,
loves the Lord God with all the heart, and all the strength, and his neighbour as himself,
would be truly a righteous man. But you were never shown to be possessed of friendship or
love either towards God, or towards the prophets, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident,
you are ever found to be idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you laid hands
even on Christ Himself; and to this very day you abide in your wickedness, execrating those
who prove that this man who was crucified by you is the Christ. Nay, more than this, you
suppose that He was crucified as hostile to and cursed by God, which supposition is the
product of your most irrational mind. For though you have the means of understanding
that this man is Christ from the signs given by Moses, yet you will not; but, in addition,
fancying that we can have no arguments, you put whatever question comes into your minds,
while you yourselves are at a loss for arguments whenever you meet with some firmly established
Christian.</p>

<head>Chapter XCIV.—In what sense he who hangs on a tree is cursed.</head>
<p>“For tell me, was it not God who commanded by Moses that no image or likeness of
anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should be made, and yet
who caused the brazen serpent to be made by Moses in the wilderness, and set it up for a
sign by which those bitten by serpents were saved? Yet is He free from unrighteousness. For
by this, as I previously remarked, He proclaimed the mystery, by which He declared that
He would break the power of the serpent which occasioned the transgression of Adam, and
[would bring] to them that believe on Him [who was foreshadowed] by this sign, i.e., Him
who was to be crucified, salvation from the fangs of the serpent, which are wicked deeds,
idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so understood, give me a reason
why Moses set up the brazen serpent for a sign, and bade those that were bitten gaze at it,
and the wounded were healed; and this, too, when he had himself commanded that no
likeness of anything whatsoever should be made.”</p>
<p>On this, another of those who came on the second day said, “You have spoken truly:
we cannot give a reason. For I have frequently interrogated the teachers about this matter,
and none of them gave me a reason: therefore continue what you are speaking; for we are
paying attention while you unfold the mystery, on account of which the doctrines of the
prophets are falsely slandered.”</p>
<p>Then I replied, “Just as God commanded the sign to be made by the brazen serpent,
and yet He is blameless; even so, though a curse lies in the law against persons who are
crucified, yet no curse lies on the Christ of God, by whom all that have committed things
worthy of a curse are saved.550</p>

<head>Chapter XCV.—Christ took upon Himself the curse due to us.</head>
<p>“For the whole human race will be found to be under a curse. For it is written in the law
of Moses, ‘Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book
of the law to do them.’551 And no one has accurately done all, nor will you venture to deny
this; but some more and some less than others have observed the ordinances enjoined. But
if those who are under this law appear to be under a curse for not having observed all the
requirements, how much more shall all the nations appear to be under a curse who practise
idolatry, who seduce youths, and commit other crimes? If, then, the Father of all wished
His Christ for the whole human family to take upon Him the curses of all, knowing that,
after He had been crucified and was dead, He would raise Him up, why do you argue about
Him, who submitted to suffer these things according to the Father’s will, as if He were accursed,
and do not rather bewail yourselves? For although His Father caused Him to suffer
these things in behalf of the human family, yet you did not commit the deed as in obedience
to the will of God. For you did not practise piety when you slew the prophets. And let none
of you say: If His Father wished Him to suffer this, in order that by His stripes the human
race might be healed, we have done no wrong. If, indeed, you repent of your sins, and recognise
Him to be Christ, and observe His commandments, then you may assert this; for, as I
have said before, remission of sins shall be yours. But if you curse Him and them that believe
on Him, and, when you have the power, put them to death, how is it possible that requisition
shall not be made of you, as of unrighteous and sinful men, altogether hard-hearted and
without understanding, because you laid your hands on Him?</p>

do.</head>
<p>“For the statement in the law, ‘Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,’552 confirms
our hope which depends on the crucified Christ, not because He who has been crucified is
cursed by God, but because God foretold that which would be done by you all, and by those
like to you, who do not know553 that this is He who existed before all, who is the eternal
Priest of God, and King, and Christ. And you clearly see that this has come to pass. For you
curse in your synagogues all those who are called554 from Him Christians; and other nations
effectively carry out the curse, putting to death those who simply confess themselves to be
Christians; to all of whom we say, You are our brethren; rather recognise the truth of God.
And while neither they nor you are persuaded by us, but strive earnestly to cause us to deny
the name of Christ, we choose rather and submit to death, in the full assurance that all the
good which God has promised through Christ He will reward us with. And in addition to
all this we pray for you, that Christ may have mercy upon you. For He taught us to pray for
our enemies also, saying, ‘Love your enemies; be kind and merciful, as your heavenly Father
is.’555 For we see that the Almighty God is kind and merciful, causing His sun to rise on the
unthankful and on the righteous, and sending rain on the holy and on the wicked; all of
whom He has taught us He will judge.</p>

<head>Chapter XCVII.—Other predictions of the cross of Christ.</head>
<p>“For it was not without design that the prophet Moses, when Hur and Aaron upheld
his hands, remained in this form until evening. For indeed the Lord remained upon the tree
almost until evening, and they buried Him at eventide; then on the third day He rose again.
This was declared by David thus: ‘With my voice I cried to the Lord, and He heard me out
of His holy hill. I laid me down, and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.’556 And
Isaiah likewise mentions concerning Him the manner in which He would die, thus: ‘I have
spread out My hands unto a people disobedient, and gainsaying, that walk in a way which
is not good.’557 And that He would rise again, Isaiah himself said: ‘His burial has been taken
away from the midst, and I will give the rich for His death.’558 And again, in other words,
David in the twenty-first559 Psalm thus refers to the suffering and to the cross in a parable
of mystery: ‘They pierced my hands and my feet; they counted all my bones. They considered
and gazed on me; they parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots upon my vesture.’
For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those
who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he
chose to have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot. And this very Psalm you
maintain does not refer to Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do not understand
that no one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has ever had his hands or
feet pierced while alive, or has died in this mysterious fashion—to wit, by the cross—save
this Jesus alone.</p>

and how He refers all things to Him, and prays to be delivered by Him from this death; at
the same time declaring in the Psalm who they are that rise up against Him, and showing
that He has truly become man capable of suffering. It is as follows: ‘O God, my God, attend
to me: why hast Thou forsaken me? The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation.
O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and Thou wilt not hear; and in the night-season,
and it is not for want of understanding in me. But Thou, the Praise of Israel, inhabitest the
holy place. Our fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. They
cried unto Thee, and were delivered: they trusted in Thee, and were not confounded. But I
am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. All they that see
me laughed me to scorn; they spake with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted on the
Lord: let Him deliver him, let Him save him, since he desires Him. For Thou art He that
took me out of the womb; my hope from the breasts of my mother: I was cast upon Thee
from the womb. Thou art my God from my mother’s belly: be not far from me, for trouble
is near; for there is none to help. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me
round. They opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones
are poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has become like wax melting in the midst
of my belly. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue has cleaved to my throat;
and Thou hast brought me into the dust of death. For many dogs have surrounded me; the
assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They pierced my hands and my feet, they did
tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me; they parted my garments among them,
and cast lots upon my vesture. But do not Thou remove Thine assistance from me, O Lord:
give heed to help me; deliver my soul from the sword, and my560 only-begotten from the
hand of the dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth, and my humility from the horns of the
unicorns. I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I praise

<p>And when I had said these words, I continued: “Now I will demonstrate to you that the
whole Psalm refers thus to Christ, by the words which I shall again explain. What is said at
first—‘O God, my God, attend to me: why hast Thou forsaken me?’—announced from the
beginning that which was to be said in the time of Christ. For when crucified, He spake: ‘O
God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?’ And what follows: ‘The words of my transgressions
are far from my salvation. O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and Thou
wilt not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me.’ These,
as well as the things which He was to do, were spoken. For on the day on which He was to
be crucified,561 having taken three of His disciples to the hill called Olivet, situated opposite
to the temple in Jerusalem, He prayed in these words: ‘Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me.’562 And again He prayed: ‘Not as I will, but as Thou wilt;’563 showing by this
that He had become truly a suffering man. But lest any one should say, He did not know
then that He had to suffer, He adds immediately in the Psalm: ‘And it is not for want of
understanding in me.’ Even as there was no ignorance on God’s part when He asked Adam
where he was, or asked Cain where Abel was; but [it was done] to convince each what kind
of man he was, and in order that through the record [of Scripture] we might have a knowledge
of all: so likewise Christ declared that ignorance was not on His side, but on theirs, who
thought that He was not the Christ, but fancied they would put Him to death, and that He,
like some common mortal, would remain in Hades.</p>

<p>“Then what follows —‘But Thou, the praise of Israel, inhabitest the holy place’—declared
that He is to do something worthy of praise and wonderment, being about to rise again
from the dead on the third day after the crucifixion; and this He has obtained from the
Father. For I have showed already that Christ is called both Jacob and Israel; and I have
proved that it is not in the blessing of Joseph and Judah alone that what relates to Him was
proclaimed mysteriously, but also in the Gospel it is written that He said: ‘All things are
delivered unto me by My Father;’ and, ‘No man knoweth the Father but the Son; nor the
Son but the Father, and they to whom the Son will reveal Him.’564 Accordingly He revealed
to us all that we have perceived by His grace out of the Scriptures, so that we know Him to
be the first-begotten of God, and to be before all creatures; likewise to be the Son of the
patriarchs, since He assumed flesh by the Virgin of their family, and submitted to become
a man without comeliness, dishonoured, and subject to suffering. Hence, also, among His
words He said, when He was discoursing about His future sufferings: ‘The Son of man must
suffer many things, and be rejected by the Pharisees and Scribes, and be crucified, and on
the third day rise again.’565 He said then that He was the Son of man, either because of His
birth by the Virgin, who was, as I said, of the family of David,566 and Jacob, and Isaac, and
Abraham; or because Adam567 was the father both of Himself and of those who have been
first enumerated from whom Mary derives her descent. For we know that the fathers of
women are the fathers likewise of those children whom their daughters bear. For [Christ]
called one of His disciples— previously known by the name of Simon—Peter; since he recognised
Him to be Christ the Son of God, by the revelation of His Father: and since we
find it recorded in the memoirs of His apostles that He is the Son of God, and since we call
Him the Son, we have understood that He proceeded before all creatures from the Father
by His power and will (for He is addressed in the writings of the prophets in one way or
another as Wisdom, and the Day,568 and the East, and a Sword, and a Stone, and a Rod,
and Jacob, and Israel); and that He became man by the Virgin, in order that the disobedience

word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received
faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the good tidings to her that the Spirit of
the Lord would come upon her, and the power of the Highest would overshadow her:
wherefore also the Holy Thing begotten of her is the Son of God;569 and she replied, ‘Be it
unto me according to thy word.’ ”570 And by her has He been born, to whom we have proved
so many Scriptures refer, and by whom God destroys both the serpent and those angels and
men who are like him; but works deliverance from death to those who repent of their
wickedness and believe upon Him.</p>

they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. They cried unto Thee, and were not confounded.
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people;’ which show
that He admits them to be His fathers, who trusted in God and were saved by Him, who
also were the fathers of the Virgin, by whom He was born and became man; and He foretells
that He shall be saved by the same God, but boasts not in accomplishing anything through
His own will or might. For when on earth He acted in the very same manner, and answered

he desires Him;’ this likewise He foretold should happen to Him. For they that saw Him
crucified shook their heads each one of them, and distorted their lips, and twisting their
noses to each other,572 they spake in mockery the words which are recorded in the memoirs
of His apostles: ‘He said he was the Son of God: let him come down; let God save him.’</p>

<head>Chapter CII.—The prediction of the events which happened to Christ when He
was born. Why God permitted it.</head>
<p>“And what follows —‘My hope from the breasts of my mother. On Thee have I been
cast from the womb; from my mother’s belly Thou art my God: for there is no helper. Many
calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth upon
me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water.
My heart has become like wax melting in the midst of my belly. My strength is become dry
like a potsherd; and my tongue has cleaved to my throat’ —foretold what would come to
pass; for the statement, ‘My hope from the breasts of my mother,’ [is thus explained]. As
soon as He was born in Bethlehem, as I previously remarked, king Herod, having learned
from the Arabian Magi about Him, made a plot to put Him to death, and by God’s command
Joseph took Him with Mary and departed into Egypt. For the Father had decreed that He
whom He had begotten should be put to death, but not before He had grown to manhood,
and proclaimed the word which proceeded from Him. But if any of you say to us, Could
not God rather have put Herod to death? I return answer by anticipation: Could not God
have cut off in the beginning the serpent, so that he exist not, rather than have said, ‘And I
will put enmity between him and the woman, and between his seed and her seed?’573 Could
He not have at once created a multitude of men? But yet, since He knew that it would be
good, He created both angels and men free to do that which is righteous, and He appointed
periods of time during which He knew it would be good for them to have the exercise of
free-will; and because He likewise knew it would be good, He made general and particular
judgments; each one’s freedom of will, however, being guarded. Hence Scripture says the
following, at the destruction of the tower, and division and alteration of tongues: ‘And the
Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they have begun
to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them of all which they have attempted to
do.’574 And the statement, ‘My strength is become dry like a potsherd, and my tongue has
cleaved to my throat,’ was also a prophecy of what would be done by Him according to the
Father’s will. For the power of His strong word, by which He always confuted the Pharisees
and Scribes, and, in short, all your nation’s teachers that questioned Him, had a cessation
like a plentiful and strong spring, the waters of which have been turned off, when He kept
silence, and chose to return no answer to any one in the presence of Pilate; as has been declared
in the memoirs of His apostles, in order that what is recorded by Isaiah might have
efficacious fruit, where it is written, ‘The Lord gives me a tongue, that I may know when I
ought to speak.’575 Again, when He said, ‘Thou art my God; be not far from me,’ He taught

that all men ought to hope in God who created all things, and seek salvation and help from
Him alone; and not suppose, as the rest of men do, that salvation can be obtained by birth,
or wealth, or strength, or wisdom. And such have ever been your practices: at one time you
made a calf, and always you have shown yourselves ungrateful, murderers of the righteous,
and proud of your descent. For if the Son of God evidently states that He can be saved,
[neither]576 because He is a son, nor because He is strong or wise, but that without God He
cannot be saved, even though He be sinless, as Isaiah declares in words to the effect that
even in regard to His very language He committed no sin (for He committed no iniquity
or guile with His mouth), how do you or others who expect to be saved without this hope,
suppose that you are not deceiving yourselves?</p>

<head>Chapter CIII.—The Pharisees are the bulls: the roaring lion is Herod or the devil.</head>
<p>“Then what is next said in the Psalm—‘For trouble is near, for there is none to help me.
Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth
upon me as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like
water,’—was likewise a prediction of the events which happened to Him. For on that night
when some of your nation, who had been sent by the Pharisees and Scribes, and teachers,577
came upon Him from the Mount578 of Olives, those whom Scripture called butting and
prematurely destructive calves surrounded Him. And the expression, ‘Fat bulls have beset
me round,’ He spoke beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was
led before your teachers. And the Scripture described them as bulls, since we know that
bulls are authors of calves’ existence. As therefore the bulls are the begetters of the calves,
so your teachers were the cause why their children went out to the Mount of Olives to take
Him and bring Him to them. And the expression, ‘For there is none to help,’ is also indicative
of what took place. For there was not even a single man to assist Him as an innocent person.
And the expression, ‘They opened their mouth upon me like a roaring lion,’ designates him
who was then king of the Jews, and was called Herod, a successor of the Herod who, when
Christ was born, slew all the infants in Bethlehem born about the same time, because he
imagined that amongst them He would assuredly be of whom the Magi from Arabia had
spoken; for he was ignorant of the will of Him that is stronger than all, how He had commanded
Joseph and Mary to take the Child and depart into Egypt, and there to remain until
a revelation should again be made to them to return into their own country. And there they
did remain until Herod, who slew the infants in Bethlehem, was dead, and Archelaus had
succeeded him. And he died before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross which was
given Him by His Father. And when Herod succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority
which had been allotted to him, Pilate sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound;
and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: ‘And they brought Him to
the Assyrian, a present to the king.’579 Or He meant the devil by the lion roaring against
Him: whom Moses calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he is called the devil, and by
Jesus is addressed as Satan, showing that a compounded name was acquired by him from
the deeds which he performed. For ‘Sata’ in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means apostate;
and ‘Nas’ is the word from which he is called by interpretation the serpent, i.e., according
to the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which there arises the single word
Satanas. For this devil, when [Jesus] went up from the river Jordan, at the time when the

voice spake to Him, ‘Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten Thee,’580 is recorded in the
memoirs of the apostles to have come to Him and tempted Him, even so far as to say to
Him, ‘Worship me;’ and Christ answered him, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan: thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.’581 For as he had deceived Adam, so he
hoped582 that he might contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the statement,
‘All my bones are poured out583 and dispersed like water; my heart has become like wax,
melting in the midst of my belly,’ was a prediction of that which happened to Him on that
night when men came out against Him to the Mount of Olives to seize Him. For in the
memoirs which I say were drawn up by His apostles and those who followed them, [it is
recorded] that His sweat fell down like drops of blood while He was praying, and saying, ‘If
it be possible, let this cup pass:’584 His heart and also His bones trembling; His heart being
like wax melting in His belly:585 in order that we may perceive that the Father wished His
Son really586 to undergo such sufferings for our sakes, and may not say that He, being the
Son of God, did not feel what was happening to Him and inflicted on Him. Further, the
expression, ‘My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my throat,’
was a prediction, as I previously remarked, of that silence, when He who convicted all your
teachers of being unwise returned no answer at all.</p>

<p>“And the statement, ‘Thou hast brought me into the dust of death; for many dogs have
surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They pierced my hands
and my feet. They did tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me. They parted my
garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture,’—was a prediction, as I said before,
of the death to which the synagogue of the wicked would condemn Him, whom He calls
both dogs and hunters, declaring that those who hunted Him were both gathered together
and assiduously striving to condemn Him. And this is recorded to have happened in the
memoirs of His apostles. And I have shown that, after His crucifixion, they who crucified
Him parted His garments among them.</p>

<head>Chapter CV.—The Psalm also predicts the crucifixion and the subject of the last
prayers of Christ on Earth.</head>
<p>“And what follows of the Psalm,—‘But Thou, Lord, do not remove Thine assistance
from me; give heed to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword, and my587 only-begotten
from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion’s mouth, and my humility from the horns
of the unicorns,’—was also information and prediction of the events which should befall
Him. For I have already proved that He was the only-begotten of the Father of all things,
being begotten in a peculiar manner Word and Power by Him, and having afterwards become
man through the Virgin, as we have learned from the memoirs. Moreover, it is similarly
foretold that He would die by crucifixion. For the passage, ‘Deliver my soul from the sword,
and my588 only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion’s mouth, and my
humility from the horns of the unicorns,’ is indicative of the suffering by which He should
die, i.e., by crucifixion. For the ‘horns of the unicorns,’ I have already explained to you, are
the figure of the cross only. And the prayer that His soul should be saved from the sword,
and lion’s mouth, and hand of the dog, was a prayer that no one should take possession of
His soul: so that, when we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition from God,
who is able to turn away every shameless evil angel from taking our souls. And that the souls
survive, I have shown589 to you from the fact that the soul of Samuel was called up by the
witch, as Saul demanded. And it appears also, that all the souls of similar righteous men
and prophets fell under the dominion of such powers, as is indeed to be inferred from the
very facts in the case of that witch. Hence also God by His Son teaches590 us for whose sake
these things seem to have been done, always to strive earnestly, and at death to pray that
our souls may not fall into the hands of any such power. For when Christ was giving up His
spirit on the cross, He said, ‘Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit,’591 as I have
learned also from the memoirs. For He exhorted His disciples to surpass the pharisaic way
of living, with the warning, that if they did not, they might be sure they could not be saved;
and these words are recorded in the memoirs: ‘Unless your righteousness exceed that of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.’592</p>

<head>Chapter CVI.—Christ’s resurrection is foretold in the conclusion of the Psalm.</head>
<p>“The remainder of the Psalm makes it manifest that He knew His Father would grant
to Him all things which He asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and that He urged
all who fear God to praise Him because He had compassion on all races of believing men,
through the mystery of Him who was crucified; and that He stood in the midst of His
brethren the apostles (who repented of their flight from Him when He was crucified, after
He rose from the dead, and after they were persuaded by Himself that, before His passion
He had mentioned to them that He must suffer these things, and that they were announced
beforehand by the prophets), and when living with them sang praises to God, as is made
evident in the memoirs of the apostles. The words are the following: ‘I will declare Thy name
to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise
Him; all ye, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.’ And when it
is said that He changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter; and when it is written in
the memoirs of Him that this so happened, as well as that He changed the names of other
two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of thunder; this was an
announcement of the fact that it was He by whom Jacob was called Israel, and Oshea called
Jesus (Joshua), under whose name the people who survived of those that came from Egypt
were conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs. And that He should arise like a
star from the seed of Abraham, Moses showed beforehand when he thus said, ‘A star shall
arise from Jacob, and a leader from Israel;’593 and another Scripture says, ‘Behold a man;
the East is His name.’594 Accordingly, when a star rose in heaven at the time of His birth,
as is recorded in the memoirs of His apostles, the Magi from Arabia, recognising the sign
by this, came and worshipped Him.</p>

<p>“And that He would rise again on the third day after the crucifixion, it is written595 in
the memoirs that some of your nation, questioning Him, said, ‘Show us a sign;’ and He
replied to them, ‘An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no sign shall
be given them, save the sign of Jonah.’ And since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood
by the audience that after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day.
And He showed that your generation was more wicked and more adulterous than the city
of Nineveh; for the latter, when Jonah preached to them, after he had been cast up on the
third day from the belly of the great fish, that after three (in other versions, forty)596 days
they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts, with sackcloth,
and with earnest lamentation, with true repentance from the heart, and turning away from
unrighteousness, in the belief that God is merciful and kind to all who turn from wickedness;
so that the king of that city himself, with his nobles also, put on sackcloth and remained
fasting and praying, and obtained their request that the city should not be overthrown. But
when Jonah was grieved that on the (fortieth) third day, as he proclaimed, the city was not
overthrown, by the dispensation of a gourd597 springing up from the earth for him, under
which he sat and was shaded from the heat (now the gourd had sprung up suddenly, and
Jonah had neither planted nor watered it, but it had come up all at once to afford him shade),
and by the other dispensation of its withering away, for which Jonah grieved, [God] convicted
him of being unjustly displeased because the city of Nineveh had not been overthrown, and
said, ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest
it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And shall I not spare Nineveh,

that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven. Moreover, you accuse Him of

exalted above the hills, and people shall flow unto it.601 And many nations shall go, and say,
Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and

forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many
peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more. And each man shall sit under his vine and under his
fig tree; and there shall be none to terrify: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken
it. For all people will walk in the name of their gods; but we will walk in the name of the
Lord our God for ever. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will assemble her that is
afflicted, and gather her that is driven out, and whom I had plagued; and I shall make her
that is afflicted a remnant, and her that is oppressed a strong nation. And the Lord shall
reign over them in Mount Zion from henceforth, and even for ever.’ ”602</p>

<head>Chapter CX.—A portion of the prophecy already fulfilled in the Christians: the
rest shall be fulfilled at the second advent.</head>
<p>And when I had finished these words, I continued: “Now I am aware that your teachers,
sirs, admit the whole of the words of this passage to refer to Christ; and I am likewise aware
that they maintain He has not yet come; or if they say that He has come, they assert that it
is not known who He is; but when He shall become manifest and glorious, then it shall be
known who He is. And then, they say, the events mentioned in this passage shall happen,
just as if there was no fruit as yet from the words of the prophecy. O unreasoning men! understanding
not what has been proved by all these passages, that two advents of Christ have
been announced: the one, in which He is set forth as suffering, inglorious, dishonoured,
and crucified; but the other, in which He shall come from heaven with glory, when the man
of apostasy,603 who speaks strange things against the Most High, shall venture to do unlawful
deeds on the earth against us the Christians, who, having learned the true worship of God
from the law, and the word which went forth from Jerusalem by means of the apostles of
Jesus, have fled for safety to the God of Jacob and God of Israel; and we who were filled with
war, and mutual slaughter, and every wickedness, have each through the whole earth changed
our warlike weapons,— our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into implements of
tillage, —and we cultivate piety, righteousness, philanthropy, faith, and hope, which we
have from the Father Himself through Him who was crucified; and sitting each under his
vine, i.e., each man possessing his own married wife. For you are aware that the prophetic
word says, ‘And his wife shall be like a fruitful vine.’604 Now it is evident that no one can
terrify or subdue us who have believed in Jesus over all the world. For it is plain that, though
beheaded, and crucified, and thrown to wild beasts, and chains, and fire, and all other kinds
of torture, we do not give up our confession; but the more such things happen, the more
do others and in larger numbers become faithful, and worshippers of God through the name
of Jesus. For just as if one should cut away the fruit-bearing parts of a vine, it grows up again,
and yields other branches flourishing and fruitful; even so the same thing happens with us.
For the vine planted by God and Christ the Saviour is His people. But the rest of the
prophecy shall be fulfilled at His second coming. For the expression, ‘He that is afflicted
[and driven out],’ i.e., from the world, [implies] that, so far as you and all other men have
it in your power, each Christian has been driven out not only from his own property, but
even from the whole world; for you permit no Christian to live. But you say that the same
fate has befallen your own nation. Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle, you
have suffered such treatment justly indeed, as all the Scriptures bear witness; but we, though
we have done no such [evil acts] after we knew the truth of God, are testified to by God,

of the first advent, in which the Gentiles are freed by the blood of Christ.</head>
<p>“And that it was declared by symbol, even in the time of Moses, that there would be two
advents of this Christ, as I have mentioned previously, [is manifest] from the symbol of the
goats presented for sacrifice during the fast. And again, by what Moses and Joshua did, the
same thing was symbolically announced and told beforehand. For the one of them,
stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and
this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross: and the other, whose name was altered
to Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, and Israel conquered. Now this took place in the case of both
those holy men and prophets of God, that you may perceive how one of them could not
bear up both the mysteries: I mean, the type of the cross and the type of the name. For this
is, was, and shall be the strength of Him alone, whose name every power dreads, being very
much tormented because they shall be destroyed by Him. Therefore our suffering and crucified
Christ was not cursed by the law, but made it manifest that He alone would save those
who do not depart from His faith. And the blood of the passover, sprinkled on each man’s
door-posts and lintel, delivered those who were saved in Egypt, when the first-born of the
Egyptians were destroyed. For the passover was Christ, who was afterwards sacrificed, as
also Isaiah said, ‘He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.’606 And it is written, that on the day
of the passover you seized Him, and that also during the passover you crucified Him. And
as the blood of the passover saved those who were in Egypt, so also the blood of Christ will
deliver from death those who have believed. Would God, then, have been deceived if this
sign had not been above the doors? I do not say that; but I affirm that He announced beforehand
the future salvation for the human race through the blood of Christ. For the sign of
the scarlet thread, which the spies, sent to Jericho by Joshua, son of Nave (Nun), gave to
Rahab the harlot, telling her to bind it to the window through which she let them down to
escape from their enemies, also manifested the symbol of the blood of Christ, by which those
who were at one time harlots and unrighteous persons out of all nations are saved, receiving
remission of sins, and continuing no longer in sin.</p>

already said) God had in the beginning cursed and cut off by the great sword, as Isaiah
says,607 be understood as having preserved at that time the people? and shall we receive
these things in the foolish acceptation of your teachers, and [regard] them not as signs? And
shall we not rather refer the standard to the resemblance of the crucified Jesus, since also
Moses by his outstretched hands, together with him who was named Jesus (Joshua), achieved
a victory for your people? For in this way we shall cease to be at a loss about the things which
the lawgiver did, when he, without forsaking God, persuaded the people to hope in a beast
through which transgression and disobedience had their origin. And this was done and said
by the blessed prophet with much intelligence and mystery; and there is nothing said or
done by any one of the prophets, without exception, which one can justly reprehend, if he
possess the knowledge which is in them. But if your teachers only expound to you why female
camels are spoken of in this passage, and are not in that; or why so many measures of fine
flour and so many measures of oil [are used] in the offerings; and do so in a low and sordid
manner, while they never venture either to speak of or to expound the points which are
great and worthy of investigation, or command you to give no audience to us while we expound
them, and to come not into conversation with us; will they not deserve to hear what
our Lord Jesus Christ said to them: ‘Whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward,
and within are full of dead men’s bones; which pay tithe of mint, and swallow a camel: ye
blind guides!’608 If, then, you will not despise the doctrines of those who exalt themselves
and wish to be called Rabbi, Rabbi, and come with such earnestness and intelligence to the
words of prophecy as to suffer the same inflictions from your own people which the
prophets themselves did, you cannot receive any advantage whatsoever from the prophetic

<head>Chapter CXIII.—Joshua was a figure of Christ.</head>
<p>“What I mean is this. Jesus (Joshua), as I have now frequently remarked, who was called
Oshea, when he was sent to spy out the land of Canaan, was named by Moses Jesus (Joshua).
Why he did this you neither ask, nor are at a loss about it, nor make strict inquiries. Therefore
Christ has escaped your notice; and though you read, you understand not; and even now,
though you hear that Jesus is our Christ, you consider not that the name was bestowed on
Him not purposelessly nor by chance. But you make a theological discussion as to why one
‘α’ was added to Abraham’s first name; and as to why one ‘ρ’ was added to Sarah’s name,
you use similar high-sounding disputations.609 But why do you not similarly investigate
the reason why the name of Oshea the son of Nave (Nun), which his father gave him, was
changed to Jesus (Joshua)? But since not only was his name altered, but he was also appointed
successor to Moses, being the only one of his contemporaries who came out from Egypt,
he led the surviving people into the Holy Land; and as he, not Moses, led the people into
the Holy Land, and as he distributed it by lot to those who entered along with him, so also
Jesus the Christ will turn again the dispersion of the people, and will distribute the good
land to each one, though not in the same manner. For the former gave them a temporary
inheritance, seeing he was neither Christ who is God, nor the Son of God; but the latter,
after the holy resurrection,610 shall give us the eternal possession. The former, after he had
been named Jesus (Joshua), and after he had received strength from His Spirit, caused the
sun to stand still. For I have proved that it was Jesus who appeared to and conversed with
Moses, and Abraham, and all the other patriarchs without exception, ministering to the will
of the Father; who also, I say, came to be born man by the Virgin Mary, and I lives for ever.
For the latter is He after611 whom and by whom the Father will renew both the heaven and
the earth; this is He who shall shine an eternal light in Jerusalem; this is he who is the king
of Salem after the order of Melchizedek, and the eternal Priest of the Most High. The former
is said to have circumcised the people a second time with knives of stone (which was a sign
of this circumcision with which Jesus Christ Himself has circumcised us from the idols
made of stone and of other materials), and to have collected together those who were circumcised
from the uncircumcision, i.e., from the error of the world, in every place by the
knives of stone, to wit, the words of our Lord Jesus. For I have shown that Christ was proclaimed
by the prophets in parables a Stone and a Rock. Accordingly the knives of stone we

shall take to mean His words, by means of which so many who were in error have been
circumcised from uncircumcision with the circumcision of the heart, with which God by
Jesus commanded those from that time to be circumcised who derived their circumcision
from Abraham, saying that Jesus (Joshua) would circumcise a second time with knives of
stone those who entered into that holy land.</p>

<head>Chapter CXIV.—Some rules for discerning what is said about Christ. The
circumcision of the Jews is very different from that which Christians receive.</head>
<p>“For the Holy Spirit sometimes brought about that something, which was the type of
the future, should be done clearly; sometimes He uttered words about what was to take
place, as if it was then taking place, or had taken place. And unless those who read perceive
this art, they will not be able to follow the words of the prophets as they ought. For example’s
sake, I shall repeat some prophetic passages, that you may understand what I say. When He
speaks by Isaiah, ‘He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the shearer,’612
He speaks as if the suffering had already taken place. And when He says again, ‘I have
stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;’613 and when He says, ‘Lord,
who hath believed our report?’614—the words are spoken as if announcing events which
had already come to pass. For I have shown that Christ is oftentimes called a Stone in parable,
and in figurative speech Jacob and Israel. And again, when He says, ‘I shall behold the
heavens, the works of Thy fingers,’615 unless I understand His method of using words,616
I shall not understand intelligently, but just as your teachers suppose, fancying that the
Father of all, the unbegotten God, has hands and feet, and fingers, and a soul, like a composite
being; and they for this reason teach that it was the Father Himself who appeared to Abraham
and to Jacob. Blessed therefore are we who have been circumcised the second time with
knives of stone. For your first circumcision was and is performed by iron instruments, for
you remain hard-hearted; but our circumcision, which is the second, having been instituted
after yours, circumcises us from idolatry and from absolutely every kind of wickedness by
sharp stones, i.e., by the words [preached] by the apostles of the corner-stone cut out without
hands. And our hearts are thus circumcised from evil, so that we are happy to die for the
name of the good Rock, which causes living water to burst forth for the hearts of those who
by Him have loved the Father of all, and which gives those who are willing to drink of the
water of life. But you do not comprehend me when I speak these things; for you have not
understood what it has been prophesied that Christ would do, and you do not believe us
who draw your attention to what has been written. For Jeremiah thus cries: ‘Woe unto you!
because you have forsaken the living fountain, and have digged for yourselves broken cisterns
that can hold no water. Shall there be a wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I gave
Jerusalem a bill of divorce in your sight?’617</p>

<head>Chapter CXV.—Prediction about the Christians in Zechariah. The malignant
way which the Jews have in disputations.</head>
<p>“But you ought to believe Zechariah when he shows in parable the mystery of Christ,
and announces it obscurely. The following are his words: ‘Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter
of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I shall dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations
shall be added to the Lord in that day. And they shall be my people, and I will dwell
in the midst of thee; and they shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. And
the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and He shall choose Jerusalem
again. Let all flesh fear before the Lord, for He is raised up out of His holy clouds. And He
showed me Jesus (Joshua) the high priest standing before the angel [of the Lord618]; and
the devil stood at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said to the devil, The Lord who
hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Behold, is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?’ ”619</p>
<p>As Trypho was about to reply and contradict me, I said, “Wait and hear what I say first:
for I am not to give the explanation which you suppose, as if there had been no priest of the
name of Joshua (Jesus) in the land of Babylon, where your nation were prisoners. But even
if I did, I have shown that if there620 was a priest named Joshua (Jesus) in your nation, yet
the prophet had not seen him in his revelation, just as he had not seen either the devil or
the angel of the Lord by eyesight, and in his waking condition, but in a trance, at the time
when the revelation was made to him.621 But I now say, that as [Scripture] said that the
Son of Nave (Nun) by the name Jesus (Joshua) wrought powerful works and exploits which
proclaimed beforehand what would be performed by our Lord; so I proceed now to show
that the revelation made among your people in Babylon in the days of Jesus (Joshua) the
priest, was an announcement of the things to be accomplished by our Priest, who is God,
and Christ the Son of God the Father of all.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I wondered,” continued I, “why a little ago you kept silence while I was
speaking, and why you did not interrupt me when I said that the son of Nave (Nun) was

<p>“But to give you the account of the revelation of the holy Jesus Christ, I take up again
my discourse, and I assert that even that revelation was made for us who believe on Christ
the High Priest, namely this crucified One; and though we lived in fornication and all kinds
of filthy conversation, we have by the grace of our Jesus, according to His Father’s will,
stripped ourselves of all those filthy wickednesses with which we were imbued. And though
the devil is ever at hand to resist us, and anxious to seduce all to himself, yet the Angel of
God, i.e., the Power of God sent to us through Jesus Christ, rebukes him, and he departs
from us. And we are just as if drawn out from the fire, when purified from our former sins,
and [rescued] from the affliction and the fiery trial by which the devil and all his coadjutors
try us; out of which Jesus the Son of God has promised again to deliver us,622 and invest us
with prepared garments, if we do His commandments; and has undertaken to provide an
eternal kingdom [for us]. For just as that Jesus (Joshua), called by the prophet a priest,
evidently had on filthy garments because he is said to have taken a harlot for a wife,623 and
is called a brand plucked out of the fire, because he had received remission of sins when the
devil that resisted him was rebuked; even so we, who through the name of Jesus have believed
as one man in God the Maker of all, have been stripped, through the name of His first-begotten
Son, of the filthy garments, i.e., of our sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the
word of His calling, we are the true high priestly race of God, as even God Himself bears
witness, saying that in every place among the Gentiles sacrifices are presented to Him wellpleasing
and pure. Now God receives sacrifices from no one, except through His priests.624</p>

It cannot be taken as referring to the prayers of Jews of the dispersion.</head>
<p>“Accordingly, God, anticipating all the sacrifices which we offer through this name, and
which Jesus the Christ enjoined us to offer, i.e., in the Eucharist of the bread and the cup,
and which are presented by Christians in all places throughout the world, bears witness that
they are well-pleasing to Him. But He utterly rejects those presented by you and by those
priests of yours, saying, ‘And I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands; for from the
rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles (He says); but ye
profane it.’625 Yet even now, in your love of contention, you assert that God does not accept
the sacrifices of those who dwelt then in Jerusalem, and were called Israelites; but says that
He is pleased with the prayers of the individuals of that nation then dispersed, and calls
their prayers sacrifices. Now, that prayers and giving of thanks, when offered by worthy
men, are the only perfect and well-pleasing sacrifices to God, I also admit. For such alone
Christians have undertaken to offer, and in the remembrance effected by their solid and liquid
food, whereby the suffering of the Son of God626 which He endured is brought to mind,
whose name the high priests of your nation and your teachers have caused to be profaned
and blasphemed over all the earth. But these filthy garments, which have been put by you
on all who have become Christians by the name of Jesus, God shows shall be taken away
from us, when He shall raise all men from the dead, and appoint some to be incorruptible,
immortal, and free from sorrow in the everlasting and imperishable kingdom; but shall send
others away to the everlasting punishment of fire. But as to you and your teachers deceiving
yourselves when you interpret what the Scripture says as referring to those of your nation
then in dispersion, and maintain that their prayers and sacrifices offered in every place are
pure and well-pleasing, learn that you are speaking falsely, and trying by all means to cheat
yourselves: for, first of all, not even now does your nation extend from the rising to the setting
of the sun, but there are nations among which none of your race ever dwelt. For there is not
one single race of men, whether barbarians, or Greeks, or whatever they may be called,
nomads, or vagrants, or herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and giving of thanks
are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus.627 And then,628 as the Scriptures

<head>Chapter CXVIII.—He exhorts to repentance before Christ comes; in whom
Christians, since they believe, are far more religious than Jews.</head>
<p>“So that you ought rather to desist from the love of strife, and repent before the great
day of judgment come, wherein all those of your tribes who have pierced this Christ shall
mourn, as I have shown has been declared by the Scriptures. And I have explained that the
Lord swore, ‘after the order of Melchizedek,’629 and what this prediction means; and the
prophecy of Isaiah which says, ‘His burial is taken away from the midst,’630 I have already
said, referred to the future burying and rising again of Christ; and I have frequently remarked
that this very Christ is the Judge of all the living and the dead. And Nathan likewise, speaking
to David about Him, thus continued: ‘I will be His Father, and He shall be my Son; and my
mercy shall I not take away from Him, as I did from them that went before Him; and I will
establish Him in my house, and in His kingdom for ever.’631 And Ezekiel says, ‘There shall
be no other prince in the house but He.’632 For He is the chosen Priest and eternal King,
the Christ, inasmuch as He is the Son of God; and do not suppose that Isaiah or the other
prophets speak of sacrifices of blood or libations being presented at the altar on His second
advent, but of true and spiritual praises and giving of thanks. And we have not in vain believed
in Him, and have not been led astray by those who taught us such doctrines; but this
has come to pass through the wonderful foreknowledge of God, in order that we, through
the calling of the new and eternal covenant, that is, of Christ, might be found more intelligent
and God-fearing than yourselves, who are considered to be lovers of God and men of understanding,
but are not. Isaiah, filled with admiration of this, said: ‘And kings shall shut their
mouths: for those to whom no announcement has been made in regard to Him633 shall see;
and those who heard not shall understand. Lord, who hath believed our report? and to
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?’634</p>

matters in the Scriptures, if we had not received grace to discern by the will of Him whose
pleasure it was? in order that the saying of Moses636 might come to pass, ‘They provoked
me with strange [gods], they provoked me to anger with their abominations. They sacrificed
to demons whom they knew not; new gods that came newly up, whom their fathers knew
not. Thou hast forsaken God that begat thee, and forgotten God that brought thee up. And
the Lord saw, and was jealous, and was provoked to anger by reason of the rage of His sons
and daughters: and He said, I will turn My face away from them, and I will show what shall
come on them at the last; for it is a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.
They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked Me to
anger with their idols; and I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a nation, I
will provoke them to anger with a foolish people. For a fire is kindled from Mine anger, and
it shall burn to Hades. It shall consume the earth and her increase, and set on fire the
foundations of the mountains; I will heap mischief on them.’637 And after that Righteous
One was put to death, we flourished as another people, and shot forth as new and prosperous
corn; as the prophets said, ‘And many nations shall betake themselves to the Lord in that
day for a people: and they shall dwell in the midst of all the earth.’638 But we are not only
a people, but also a holy people, as we have shown already.639 ‘And they shall call them the
holy people, redeemed by the Lord.’640 Therefore we are not a people to be despised, nor a
barbarous race, nor such as the Carian and Phrygian nations; but God has even chosen us,
and He has become manifest to those who asked not after Him. ‘Behold, I am God,’ He says,
‘to the nation which called not on My name.’641 For this is that nation which God of old
promised to Abraham, when He declared that He would make him a father of many nations;
not meaning, however, the Arabians, or Egyptians, or Idumæans, since Ishmael became the
father of a mighty nation, and so did Esau; and there is now a great multitude of Ammonites.
Noah, moreover, was the father of Abraham, and in fact of all men; and others were the
progenitors of others. What larger measure of grace, then, did Christ bestow on Abraham?
This, namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, telling him to quit the
land wherein he dwelt. And He has called all of us by that voice, and we have left already

Abraham through the like faith. For as he believed the voice of God, and it was imputed to
him for righteousness, in like manner we, having believed God’s voice spoken by the apostles
of Christ, and promulgated to us by the prophets, have renounced even to death all the

Jacob: ‘And in thee and in thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.’643 He says that
neither to Esau nor to Reuben, nor to any other; only to those of whom the Christ should
arise, according to the dispensation, through the Virgin Mary. But if you would consider
the blessing of Judah, you would perceive what I say. For the seed is divided from Jacob,
and comes down through Judah, and Phares, and Jesse, and David. And this was a symbol
of the fact that some of your nation would be found children of Abraham, and found, too,
in the lot of Christ; but that others, who are indeed children of Abraham, would be like the
sand on the sea-shore, barren and fruitless, much in quantity, and without number indeed,
but bearing no fruit whatever, and only drinking the water of the sea. And a vast multitude
in your nation are convicted of being of this kind, imbibing doctrines of bitterness and
godlessness, but spurning the word of God. He speaks therefore in the passage relating to
Judah: ‘A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a ruler from his thighs, till that which is laid
up for him come; and He shall be the expectation of the nations.’644 And it is plain that this
was spoken not of Judah, but of Christ. For all we out of all nations do expect not Judah,
but Jesus, who led your fathers out of Egypt. For the prophecy referred even to the advent
of Christ: ‘Till He come for whom this is laid up, and He shall be the expectation of nations.’
Jesus came, therefore, as we have shown at length, and is expected again to appear above
the clouds; whose name you profane, and labour hard to get it profaned over all the earth.
It were possible for me, sirs,” I continued, “to contend against you about the reading which
you so interpret, saying it is written, ‘Till the things laid up for Him come;’ though the Seventy
have not so explained it, but thus, ‘Till He comes for whom this is laid up.’ But since what
follows indicates that the reference is to Christ (for it is, ‘and He shall be the expectation of

Him.’ So it is here: ‘His name shall rise up for ever above the sun; and in Him shall all nations
be blessed.’648 But if all nations are blessed in Christ, and we of all nations believe in Him,
then He is indeed the Christ, and we are those blessed by Him. God formerly gave the sun
as an object of worship,649 as it is written, but no one ever was seen to endure death on account
of his faith in the sun; but for the name of Jesus you may see men of every nation who
have endured and do endure all sufferings, rather than deny Him. For the word of His truth
and wisdom is more ardent and more light-giving than the rays of the sun, and sinks down
into the depths of heart and mind. Hence also the Scripture said, ‘His name shall rise up
above the sun.’ And again, Zechariah says, ‘His name is the East.’650 And speaking of the
same, he says that ‘each tribe shall mourn.’651 But if He so shone forth and was so mighty
in His first advent (which was without honour and comeliness, and very contemptible), that
in no nation He is unknown, and everywhere men have repented of the old wickedness in
each nation’s way of living, so that even demons were subject to His name, and all powers
and kingdoms feared His name more than they feared all the dead, shall He not on His
glorious advent destroy by all means all those who hated Him, and who unrighteously departed
from Him, but give rest to His own, rewarding them with all they have looked for?
To us, therefore, it has been granted to hear, and to understand, and to be saved by this
Christ, and to recognise all the [truths revealed] by the Father. Wherefore He said to Him:
‘It is a great thing for Thee to be called my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and turn
again the dispersed of Israel. I have appointed Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou
mayest be their salvation unto the end of the earth.’652</p>

<head>Chapter CXXII.—The Jews understand this of the proselytes without reason.</head>
<p>“You think that these words refer to the stranger653 and the proselytes, but in fact they
refer to us who have been illumined by Jesus. For Christ would have borne witness even to
them; but now you are become twofold more the children of hell, as He said Himself.654
Therefore what was written by the prophets was spoken not of those persons, but of us,
concerning whom the Scripture speaks: ‘I will lead the blind by a way which they knew not;
and they shall walk in paths which they have not known. And I am witness, saith the Lord
God, and my servant whom I have chosen.’655 To whom, then, does Christ bear witness?
Manifestly to those who have believed. But the proselytes not only do not believe, but twofold
more than yourselves blaspheme His name, and wish to torture and put to death us who
believe in Him; for in all points they strive to be like you. And again in other words He cries:
‘I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen
Thee, and will give Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the
eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoners from their bonds.’656 These words, indeed, sirs,
refer also to Christ, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say again, He speaks
to them of the law and the proselytes?”</p>
<p>Then some of those who had come on the second day cried out as if they had been in a
theatre, “But what? does He not refer to the law, and to those illumined by it? Now these
are proselytes.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, looking towards Trypho, “since, if the law were able to enlighten the nations
and those who possess it, what need is there of a new covenant? But since God announced
beforehand that He would send a new covenant, and an everlasting law and commandment,
we will not understand this of the old law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes,
namely us Gentiles, whom He has illumined, as He says somewhere: ‘Thus saith the Lord,
In an acceptable time have I heard Thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped Thee, and
I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, and to inherit the
deserted.’657 What, then, is Christ’s inheritance? Is it not the nations? What is the covenant
of God? Is it not Christ? As He says in another place: ‘Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten
Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.’658</p>

<head>Chapter CXXIII.—Ridiculous interpretations of the Jews. Christians are the
true Israel.</head>
<p>“As, therefore, all these latter prophecies refer to Christ and the nations, you should
believe that the former refer to Him and them in like manner. For the proselytes have no
need of a covenant, if, since there is one and the same law imposed on all that are circumcised,
the Scripture speaks about them thus: ‘And the stranger shall also be joined with them, and
shall be joined to the house of Jacob;’659 and because the proselyte, who is circumcised that
he may have access to the people, becomes like one of themselves,660 while we who have
been deemed worthy to be called a people are yet Gentiles, because we have not been circumcised.
Besides, it is ridiculous for you to imagine that the eyes of the proselytes are to be
opened while your own are not, and that you be understood as blind and deaf while they
are enlightened. And it will be still more ridiculous for you, if you say that the law has been
given to the nations, but you have not known it. For you would have stood in awe of God’s
wrath, and would not have been lawless, wandering sons; being much afraid of hearing God
always say, ‘Children in whom is no faith. And who are blind, but my servants? and deaf,
but they that rule over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often,
but have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not heard.’661 Is God’s
commendation of you honourable? and is God’s testimony seemly for His servants? You
are not ashamed though you often hear these words. You do not tremble at God’s threats,
for you are a people foolish and hard-hearted. ‘Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove
this people,’ saith the Lord; ‘and I will remove them, and destroy the wisdom of the wise,
and hide the understanding of the prudent.’662 Deservedly too: for you are neither wise nor
prudent, but crafty and unscrupulous; wise only to do evil, but utterly incompetent to know
the hidden counsel of God, or the faithful covenant of the Lord, or to find out the everlasting
paths. ‘Therefore, saith the Lord, I will raise up to Israel and to Judah the seed of men and
the seed of beasts.’663 And by Isaiah He speaks thus concerning another Israel: ‘In that day
shall there be a third Israel among the Assyrians and the Egyptians, blessed in the land which
the Lord of Sabaoth hath blessed, saying, blessed shall my people in Egypt and in Assyria
be, and Israel mine inheritance.’664 Since then God blesses this people, and calls them Israel,
and declares them to be His inheritance, how is it that you repent not of the deception you
practise on yourselves, as if you alone were the Israel, and of execrating the people whom

God has blessed? For when He speaks to Jerusalem and its environs, He thus added: ‘And
I will beget men upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall inherit you, and you shall
be a possession for them; and you shall be no longer bereaved of them.’ ”665</p>
<p>“What, then?” says Trypho; “are you Israel? and speaks He such things of you?”</p>
<p>“If, indeed,” I replied to him, “we had not entered into a lengthy666 discussion on these
topics, I might have doubted whether you ask this question in ignorance; but since we have
brought the matter to a conclusion by demonstration and with your assent, I do not believe
that you are ignorant of what I have just said, or desire again mere contention, but that you
are urging me to exhibit the same proof to these men.” And in compliance with the assent
expressed in his eyes, I continued: “Again in Isaiah, if you have ears to hear it, God, speaking
of Christ in parable, calls Him Jacob and Israel. He speaks thus: ‘Jacob is my servant, I will
uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth
judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice
in the street: a bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench; but
He shall bring forth judgment to truth: He shall shine,667 and shall not be broken till He
have set judgment on the earth. And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.’668 As therefore
from the one man Jacob, who was surnamed Israel, all your nation has been called Jacob
and Israel; so we from Christ, who begat us unto God, like Jacob, and Israel, and Judah, and
Joseph, and David, are called and are the true sons of God, and keep the commandments
of Christ.”</p>

<head>Chapter CXXIV.—Christians are the sons of God.</head>
<p>And when I saw that they were perturbed because I said that we are the sons of God, I
anticipated their questioning, and said, “Listen, sirs, how the Holy Ghost speaks of this
people, saying that they are all sons of the Highest; and how this very Christ will be present
in their assembly, rendering judgment to all men. The words are spoken by David, and are,
according to your version of them, thus: ‘God standeth in the congregation of gods; He
judgeth among the gods. How long do ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
wicked? Judge for the orphan and the poor, and do justice to the humble and needy. Deliver
the needy, and save the poor out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither have
they understood; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.
I said, Ye are gods, and are all children of the Most High. But ye die like men, and fall like
one of the princes. Arise, O God! judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit all nations.’669 But
in the version of the Seventy it is written, ‘Behold, ye die like men, and fall like one of the
princes,’670 in order to manifest the disobedience of men,—I mean of Adam and Eve,—and
the fall of one of the princes, i.e., of him who was called the serpent, who fell with a great
overthrow, because he deceived Eve. But as my discourse is not intended to touch on this
point, but to prove to you that the Holy Ghost reproaches men because they were made like
God, free from suffering and death, provided that they kept His commandments, and were
deemed deserving of the name of His sons, and yet they, becoming like Adam and Eve, work
out death for themselves; let the interpretation of the Psalm be held just as you wish, yet
thereby it is demonstrated that all men are deemed worthy of becoming “gods,” and of
having power to become sons of the Highest; and shall be each by himself judged and condemned
like Adam and Eve. Now I have proved at length that Christ is called God.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXV.—He explains what force the word Israel has, and how it suits
Christ.</head>
<p>“I wish, sirs,” I said, “to learn from you what is the force of the name Israel.” And as
they were silent, I continued: “I shall tell you what I know: for I do not think it right, when
I know, not to speak; or, suspecting that you do know, and yet from envy or from voluntary
ignorance deceive yourselves,671 to be continually solicitous; but I speak all things simply
and candidly, as my Lord said: ‘A sower went forth to sow the seed; and some fell by the
wayside; and some among thorns, and some on stony ground, and some on good ground.’672
I must speak, then, in the hope of finding good ground somewhere; since that Lord of mine,
as One strong and powerful, comes to demand back His own from all, and will not condemn
His steward if He recognises that he, by the knowledge that the Lord is powerful and has
come to demand His own, has given it to every bank, and has not digged for any cause
whatsoever. Accordingly the name Israel signifies this, A man who overcomes power; for
Isra is a man overcoming, and El is power.673 And that Christ would act so when He became
man was foretold by the mystery of Jacob’s wrestling with Him who appeared to him, in
that He ministered to the will of the Father, yet nevertheless is God, in that He is the firstbegotten
of all creatures. For when He became man, as I previously remarked, the devil
came to Him—i.e., that power which is called the serpent and Satan—tempting Him, and
striving to effect His downfall by asking Him to worship him. But He destroyed and overthrew
the devil, having proved him to be wicked, in that he asked to be worshipped as God,
contrary to the Scripture; who is an apostate from the will of God. For He answers him, ‘It
is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.’674 Then,
overcome and convicted, the devil departed at that time. But since our Christ was to be
numbed, i.e., by pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation of this by
touching Jacob’s thigh, and causing it to shrink. But Israel was His name from the beginning,
to which He altered the name of the blessed Jacob when He blessed him with His own name,
proclaiming thereby that all who through Him have fled for refuge to the Father, constitute
the blessed Israel. But you, having understood none of this, and not being prepared to understand,
since you are the children of Jacob after the fleshly seed, expect that you shall be
assuredly saved. But that you deceive yourselves in such matters, I have proved by many
words.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXVI.—The various names of Christ according to both natures. It is
shown that He is God, and appeared to the patriarchs.</head>
<p>“But if you knew, Trypho,” continued I, “who He is that is called at one time the Angel
of great counsel,675 and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the Son of man by Daniel, and a Child
by Isaiah, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and Christ and a Stone by many,
and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a Star by Moses, and the East by
Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and Israel by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and
Flower, and Corner-Stone, and Son of God, you would not have blasphemed Him who has
now come, and been born, and suffered, and ascended to heaven; who shall also come again,
and then your twelve tribes shall mourn. For if you had understood what has been written
by the prophets, you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten,
unutterable God. For Moses says somewhere in Exodus the following: ‘The Lord spoke to
Moses, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established my covenant with
them.’676 And thus again he says, ‘A man wrestled with Jacob,’677 and asserts it was God;
narrating that Jacob said, ‘I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.’ And it is
recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him,
the Face of God (Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak
in Mamre, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on to say:
‘And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood before him; and when
he saw them, he ran to meet them.’678 After a little, one of them promises a son to Abraham:
‘Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything
impossible with God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of life, and
Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from Abraham.’679 Again he speaks of them
thus: ‘And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom.’680 Then to Abraham
He who was and is again speaks: ‘I will not hide from Abraham, my servant, what I intend
to do.’ ”681 And what follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and explained; “from which
I have demonstrated,” I said, “that He who is described as God appeared to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs, was appointed under the authority of the
Father and Lord, and ministers to His will.” Then I went on to say what I had not said before:

“And so, when the people desired to eat flesh, and Moses had lost faith in Him, who also
there is called the Angel, and who promised that God would give them to satiety, He who
is both God and the Angel, sent by the Father, is described as saying and doing these things.
For thus the Scripture says: ‘And the Lord said to Moses, Will the Lord’s hand not be sufficient?
thou shalt know now whether my word shall conceal thee or not.’682 And again, in
other words, it thus says: ‘But the Lord spake unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan:
the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy face, He shall cut off the nations.’683</p>

<head>Chapter CXXVII.—These passages of Scripture do not apply to the Father, but
to the Word.</head>
<p>“These and other such sayings are recorded by the lawgiver and by the prophets; and I
suppose that I have stated sufficiently, that wherever684 God says, ‘God went up from Abraham,’
685 or, ‘The Lord spake to Moses,’686 and ‘The Lord came down to behold the tower
which the sons of men had built,’687 or when ‘God shut Noah into the ark,’688 you must
not imagine that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from any place. For
the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither has come to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor
rises up, but remains in His own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to hear,
having neither eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and
knows all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not moved or confined
to a spot in the whole world, for He existed before the world was made. How, then, could
He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth,
when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent from
Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it
was filled with the glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple
when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it?
Therefore neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father and
ineffable Lord of all, and also of Christ, but [saw] Him who was according to His will His
Son, being God, and the Angel because He ministered to His will; whom also it pleased Him
to be born man by the Virgin; who also was fire when He conversed with Moses from the
bush. Since, unless we thus comprehend the Scriptures, it must follow that the Father and
Lord of all had not been in heaven when what Moses wrote took place: ‘And the Lord rained
upon Sodom fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven;’689 and again, when it is thus
said by David: ‘Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting gates; and the
King of glory shall enter;’690 and again, when He says: ‘The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My

<p>“And that Christ being Lord, and God the Son of God, and appearing formerly in power
as Man, and Angel, and in the glory of fire as at the bush, so also was manifested at the
judgment executed on Sodom, has been demonstrated fully by what has been said.” Then
I repeated once more all that I had previously quoted from Exodus, about the vision in the
bush, and the naming of Joshua (Jesus), and continued: “And do not suppose, sirs, that I
am speaking superfluously when I repeat these words frequently: but it is because I know
that some wish to anticipate these remarks, and to say that the power sent from the Father
of all which appeared to Moses, or to Abraham, or to Jacob, is called an Angel because He
came to men (for by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to men); is
called Glory, because He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be borne; is called a
Man, and a human being, because He appears arrayed in such forms as the Father pleases;
and they call Him the Word, because He carries tidings from the Father to men: but maintain
that this power is indivisible and inseparable from the Father, just as they say that the light
of the sun on earth is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in the heavens; as when it
sinks, the light sinks along with it; so the Father, when He chooses, say they, causes His
power to spring forth, and when He chooses, He makes it return to Himself. In this way,
they teach, He made the angels. But it is proved that there are angels who always exist, and
are never reduced to that form out of which they sprang. And that this power which the
prophetic word calls God, as has been also amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not numbered
[as different] in name only like the light of the sun, but is indeed something numerically
distinct, I have discussed briefly in what has gone before; when I asserted that this power
was begotten from the Father, by His power and will, but not by abscission, as if the essence
of the Father were divided; as all other things partitioned and divided are not the same after
as before they were divided: and, for the sake of example, I took the case of fires kindled
from a fire, which we see to be distinct from it, and yet that from which many can be kindled
is by no means made less, but remains the same.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXIX.—That is confirmed from other passages of Scripture.</head>
<p>“And now I shall again recite the words which I have spoken in proof of this point.
When Scripture says, ‘The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven,’ the prophetic word
indicates that there were two in number: One upon the earth, who, it says, descended to
behold the cry of Sodom; Another in heaven, who also is Lord of the Lord on earth, as He
is Father and God; the cause of His power and of His being Lord and God. Again, when the
Scripture records that God said in the beginning, ‘Behold, Adam has become like one of
Us,’692 this phrase, ‘like one of Us,’ is also indicative of number; and the words do not admit
of a figurative meaning, as the sophists endeavour to affix on them, who are able neither to
tell nor to understand the truth. And it is written in the book of Wisdom: ‘If I should tell
you daily events, I would be mindful to enumerate them from the beginning. The Lord
created me the beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He established me
in the beginning, before He formed the earth, and before He made the depths, and before
the springs of waters came forth, before the mountains were settled; He begets me before
all the hills.’ ”693 When I repeated these words, I added: “You perceive, my hearers, if you
bestow attention, that the Scripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten by the
Father before all things created; and that which is begotten is numerically distinct from that
which begets, any one will admit.”</p>

not recounted before. They are recorded by the faithful servant Moses in parable, and are
as follows: ‘Rejoice, O ye heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him;’
”694 and I added what follows of the passage: “ ‘Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people, and
let all the angels of God be strengthened in Him: for the blood of His sons He avenges, and
will avenge, and will recompense His enemies with vengeance, and will recompense those
that hate Him; and the Lord will purify the land of His people.’ And by these words He declares
that we, the nations, rejoice with His people, —to wit, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
and the prophets, and, in short, all of that people who are well-pleasing to God, according
to what has been already agreed on between us. But we will not receive it of all your nation;
since we know from Isaiah695 that the members of those who have transgressed shall be
consumed by the worm and unquenchable fire, remaining immortal; so that they become
a spectacle to all flesh. But in addition to these, I wish, sirs,” said I, “to add some other passages
from the very words of Moses, from which you may understand that God has from
of old dispersed all men according to their kindreds and tongues; and out of all kindreds
has taken to Himself your kindred, a useless, disobedient, and faithless generation; and has
shown that those who were selected out of every nation have obeyed His will through
Christ,—whom He calls also Jacob, and names Israel, —and these, then, as I mentioned
fully previously, must be Jacob and Israel. For when He says, ‘Rejoice, O ye nations, with
His people,’ He allots the same inheritance to them, and does not call them by the same
name;696 but when He says that they as Gentiles rejoice with His people, He calls them
Gentiles to reproach you. For even as you provoked Him to anger by your idolatry, so also
He has deemed those who were idolaters worthy of knowing His will, and of inheriting His
inheritance.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXXI.—How much more faithful to God the Gentiles are who are
converted to Christ than the Jews.</head>
<p>“But I shall quote the passage by which it is made known that God divided all the nations.
It is as follows: ‘Ask thy father, and he will show thee; thine elders, and they will tell thee;
when the Most High divided the nations, as He dispersed the sons of Adam. He set the
bounds of the nations according to the numbers of the children of Israel; and the Lord’s
portion became His people Jacob, and Israel was the lot of His inheritance.’ ”697 And having
said this, I added: “The Seventy have translated it, ‘He set the bounds of the nations according
to the number of the angels of God.’ But because my argument is again in nowise weakened
by this, I have adopted your exposition. And you yourselves, if you will confess the truth,
must acknowledge that we, who have been called by God through the despised and shameful
mystery of the cross (for the confession of which, and obedience to which, and for our piety,
punishments even to death have been inflicted on us by demons, and by the host of the
devil, through the aid ministered to them by you), and endure all torments rather than deny
Christ even by word, through whom we are called to the salvation prepared beforehand by
the Father, are more faithful to God than you, who were redeemed from Egypt with a high
hand and a visitation of great glory, when the sea was parted for you, and a passage left dry,
in which [God] slew those who pursued you with a very great equipment, and splendid
chariots, bringing back upon them the sea which had been made a way for your sakes; on
whom also a pillar of light shone, in order that you, more than any other nation in the world,
might possess a peculiar light, never-failing and never-setting; for whom He rained manna
as nourishment, fit for the heavenly angels, in order that you might have no need to prepare
your food; and the water at Marah was made sweet; and a sign of Him that was to be crucified
was made, both in the matter of the serpents which bit you, as I already mentioned (God
anticipating before the proper times these mysteries, in order to confer grace upon you, to
whom you are always convicted of being thankless), as well as in the type of the extending
of the hands of Moses, and of Oshea being named Jesus (Joshua); when you fought against
Amalek: concerning which God enjoined that the incident be recorded, and the name of
Jesus laid up in your understandings; saying that this is He who would blot out the memorial
of Amalek from under heaven. Now it is clear that the memorial of Amalek remained after
the son of Nave (Nun): but He makes it manifest through Jesus, who was crucified, of whom
also those symbols were fore-announcements of all that would happen to Him, the demons
would be destroyed, and would dread His name, and that all principalities and kingdoms
would fear Him; and that they who believe in Him out of all nations would be shown as
God-fearing and peaceful men; and the facts already quoted by me, Trypho, indicate this.

God’s power on account of the ark, and if God wished it to be taken back to the place from
which it had been carried away. And when they had done this, the cows, led by no man,
went not to the place whence the ark had been taken, but to the fields of a certain man whose
name was Oshea, the same as his whose name was altered to Jesus (Joshua), as has been
previously mentioned, who also led the people into the land and meted it out to them: and
when the cows had come into these fields they remained there, showing to you thereby that
they were guided by the name of power;701 just as formerly the people who survived of those
that came out of Egypt, were guided into the land by him who had received the name Jesus
(Joshua), who before was called Oshea.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXXIII.—The hard-heartedness of the Jews, for whom the Christians
pray.</head>
<p>“Now, although these and all other such unexpected and marvellous works were wrought
amongst and seen by you at different times, yet you are convicted by the prophets of having
gone to such a length as offering your own children to demons; and besides all this, of having
dared to do such things against Christ; and you still dare to do them: for all which may it
be granted to you to obtain mercy and salvation from God and His Christ. For God, knowing
before that you would do such things, pronounced this curse upon you by the prophet
Isaiah: ‘Woe unto their soul! they have devised evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let
us bind the righteous man, for he is distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of
their own doings. Woe to the wicked! evil, according to the works of his hands, shall befall
him. O my people, your exactors glean you, and those who extort from you shall rule over
you. O my people, they who call you blessed cause you to err, and disorder the way of your
paths. But now the Lord shall assist His people to judgment, and He shall enter into judgment
with the elders of the people and the princes thereof. But why have you burnt up my vineyard?
and why is the spoil of the poor found in your houses? Why do you wrong my people, and
put to shame the countenance of the humble?’702 Again, in other words, the same prophet
spake to the same effect: ‘Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and
their transgressions as with the harness of an heifer’s yoke: who say, Let His speed come
near, and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. Woe unto
them that call evil good, and good evil! that put light for darkness, and darkness for light!
that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own
eyes, and prudent in their own sight! Woe unto those that are mighty among you, who drink
wine, who are men of strength, who mingle strong drink! who justify the wicked for a reward,
and take away justice from the righteous! Therefore, as the stubble shall be burnt by the coal
of fire, and utterly consumed by the burning flame, their root shall be as wool, and their
flower shall go up like dust. For they would not have the law of the Lord of Sabaoth, but
despised703 the word of the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. And the Lord of Sabaoth was very
angry, and laid His hands upon them, and smote them; and He was provoked against the
mountains, and their carcases were in the midst like dung on the road. And for all this they
have not repented,704 but their hand is still high.’705 For verily your hand is high to commit
evil, because ye slew the Christ, and do not repent of it; but so far from that, ye hate and
murder us who have believed through Him in the God and Father of all, as often as ye can;

<head>Chapter CXXXIV.—The marriages of Jacob are a figure of the Church.</head>
<p>“If, then, the teaching of the prophets and of Himself moves you, it is better for you to
follow God than your imprudent and blind masters, who even till this time permit each
man to have four or five wives; and if any one see a beautiful woman and desire to have her,
they quote the doings of Jacob [called] Israel, and of the other patriarchs, and maintain that
it is not wrong to do such things; for they are miserably ignorant in this matter. For, as I
before said, certain dispensations of weighty mysteries were accomplished in each act of
this sort. For in the marriages of Jacob I shall mention what dispensation and prophecy
were accomplished, in order that you may thereby know that your teachers never looked at
the divine motive which prompted each act, but only at the grovelling and corrupting passions.
Attend therefore to what I say. The marriages of Jacob were types of that which Christ
was about to accomplish. For it was not lawful for Jacob to marry two sisters at once. And
he serves Laban for [one of] the daughters; and being deceived in [the obtaining of] the
younger, he again served seven years. Now Leah is your people and synagogue; but Rachel
is our Church. And for these, and for the servants in both, Christ even now serves. For while
Noah gave to the two sons the seed of the third as servants, now on the other hand Christ
has come to restore both the free sons and the servants amongst them, conferring the same
honour on all of them who keep His commandments; even as the children of the free women
and the children of the bond women born to Jacob were all sons, and equal in dignity. And
it was foretold what each should be according to rank and according to fore-knowledge.
Jacob served Laban for speckled and many-spotted sheep; and Christ served, even to the
slavery of the cross, for the various and many-formed races of mankind, acquiring them by
the blood and mystery of the cross. Leah was weak-eyed; for the eyes of your souls are excessively
weak. Rachel stole the gods of Laban, and has hid them to this day; and we have
lost our paternal and material gods. Jacob was hated for all time by his brother; and we now,
and our Lord Himself, are hated by you and by all men, though we are brothers by nature.
Jacob was called Israel; and Israel has been demonstrated to be the Christ, who is, and is
called, Jesus.</p>

<head>Chapter CXXXV.—Christ is king of Israel, and Christians are the Israelitic race.</head>
<p>“And when Scripture says, ‘I am the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who have made
known Israel your King,’706 will you not understand that truly Christ is the everlasting King?
For you are aware that Jacob the son of Isaac was never a king. And therefore Scripture
again, explaining to us, says what king is meant by Jacob and Israel: ‘Jacob is my Servant, I
will uphold Him; and Israel is mine Elect, my soul shall receive Him. I have given Him my
Spirit; and He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, and His voice
shall not be heard without. The bruised reed He shall not break, and the smoking flax He
shall not quench, until He shall bring forth judgment to victory. He shall shine, and shall
not be broken, until He set judgment on the earth. And in His name shall the Gentiles
trust.’707 Then is it Jacob the patriarch in whom the Gentiles and yourselves shall trust? or
is it not Christ? As, therefore, Christ is the Israel and the Jacob, even so we, who have been
quarried out from the bowels of Christ, are the true Israelitic race. But let us attend rather
to the very word: ‘And I will bring forth,’ He says, ‘the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah:
and it shall inherit My holy mountain; and Mine Elect and My servants shall possess the
inheritance, and shall dwell there; and there shall be folds of flocks in the thicket, and the
valley of Achor shall be a resting-place of cattle for the people who have sought Me. But as
for you, who forsake Me, and forget My holy mountain, and prepare a table for demons,
and fill out drink for the demon, I shall give you to the sword. You shall all fall with a
slaughter; for I called you, and you hearkened not, and did evil before me, and did choose
that wherein I delighted not.’708 Such are the words of Scripture; understand, therefore,
that the seed of Jacob now referred to is something else, and not, as may be supposed, spoken
of your people. For it is not possible for the seed of Jacob to leave an entrance for the descendants
of Jacob, or for [God] to have accepted the very same persons whom He had reproached
with unfitness for the inheritance, and promise it to them again; but as there the
prophet says, ‘And now, O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the Lord; for
He has sent away His people, the house of Jacob, because their land was full, as at the first,
of soothsayers and divinations;’709 even so it is necessary for us here to observe that there
are two seeds of Judah, and two races, as there are two houses of Jacob: the one begotten by
blood and flesh, the other by faith and the Spirit.</p>

be found in the cluster, and they will say, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do
for My servant’s sake: for His sake I will not destroy them all.’710 And thereafter He adds:
‘And I shall bring forth the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah.’ It is plain then that if He
thus be angry with them, and threaten to leave very few of them, He promises to bring forth
certain others, who shall dwell in His mountain. But these are the persons whom He said
He would sow and beget. For you neither suffer Him when He calls you, nor hear Him when
He speaks to you, but have done evil in the presence of the Lord. But the highest pitch of
your wickedness lies in this, that you hate the Righteous One, and slew Him; and so treat
those who have received from Him all that they are and have, and who are pious, righteous,
and humane. Therefore ‘woe unto their soul,’ says the Lord,711 ‘for they have devised an
evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful
to us.’ For indeed you are not in the habit of sacrificing to Baal, as were your fathers, or of
placing cakes in groves and on high places for the host of heaven: but you have not accepted
God’s Christ. For he who knows not Him, knows not the will of God; and he who insults
and hates Him, insults and hates Him that sent Him. And whoever believes not in Him,
believes not the declarations of the prophets, who preached and proclaimed Him to all.</p>

you have from the tenets that are put into you; for that was given for a sign, and not for a

no ridicule on the Son of God; obey not the Pharisaic teachers, and scoff not at the King of

which says, ‘Woe unto them! for they have devised evil counsel against themselves, saying’714

<p>“You know, then, sirs,” I said, “that God has said in Isaiah to Jerusalem: ‘I saved thee
in the deluge of Noah.’715 By this which God said was meant that the mystery of saved men
appeared in the deluge. For righteous Noah, along with the other mortals at the deluge, i.e.,
with his own wife, his three sons and their wives, being eight in number, were a symbol of
the eighth day, wherein Christ appeared when He rose from the dead, for ever the first in
power. For Christ, being the first-born of every creature, became again the chief of another
race regenerated by Himself through water, and faith, and wood, containing the mystery of
the cross; even as Noah was saved by wood when he rode over the waters with his household.
Accordingly, when the prophet says, ‘I saved thee in the times of Noah,’ as I have already
remarked, he addresses the people who are equally faithful to God, and possess the same
signs. For when Moses had the rod in his hands, he led your nation through the sea. And
you believe that this was spoken to your nation only, or to the land. But the whole earth, as
the Scripture says, was inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above all the
mountains: so that it is evident this was not spoken to the land, but to the people who obeyed
Him: for whom also He had before prepared a resting-place in Jerusalem, as was previously
demonstrated by all the symbols of the deluge; I mean, that by water, faith, and wood, those
who are afore-prepared, and who repent of the sins which they have committed, shall escape
from the impending judgment of God.</p>
<note type="footnote">715 Isa. liv. 9 comes nearer to these words than any other passage; but still the exact quotation is not in Isaiah,

<head>Chapter CXXXIX.—The blessings, and also the curse, pronounced by Noah were
prophecies of the future.</head>
<p>“For another mystery was accomplished and predicted in the days of Noah, of which
you are not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith Noah blessed his two sons, and in
the curse pronounced on his son’s son. For the Spirit of prophecy would not curse the son
that had been by God blessed along with [his brothers]. But since the punishment of the sin
would cleave to the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father’s nakedness, he made
the curse originate with his son.716 Now, in what he said, he foretold that the descendants
of Shem would keep in retention the property and dwellings of Canaan: and again that the
descendants of Japheth would take possession of the property of which Shem’s descendants
had dispossessed Canaan’s descendants; and spoil the descendants of Shem, even as they
plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in which it has so come to pass. For
you, who have derived your lineage from Shem, invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan
by the will of God; and you possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth, having
invaded you in turn by the judgment of God, have taken your land from you, and have
possessed it. Thus it is written: ‘And Noah awoke from the wine, and knew what his
younger son had done unto him; and he said, Cursed be Canaan, the servant; a servant shall
he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall
be his servant. May the Lord enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the houses of Shem; and
let Canaan be his servant.’717 Accordingly, as two peoples were blessed,—those from Shem,
and those from Japheth,—and as the offspring of Shem were decreed first to possess the
dwellings of Canaan, and the offspring of Japheth were predicted as in turn receiving the
same possessions, and to the two peoples there was the one people of Canaan handed over
for servants; so Christ has come according to the power given Him from the Almighty
Father, and summoning men to friendship, and blessing, and repentance, and dwelling together,
has promised, as has already been proved, that there shall be a future possession for
all the saints in this same land. And hence all men everywhere, whether bond or free, who
believe in Christ, and recognise the truth in His own words and those of His prophets, know
that they shall be with Him in that land, and inherit everlasting and incorruptible good.</p>

the two handmaids of his two free wives, and of them begat sons, for the purpose of indicating
beforehand that Christ would receive even all those who amongst Japheth’s race are descendants
of Canaan, equally with the free, and would have the children fellow-heirs. And we are
such; but you cannot comprehend this, because you cannot drink of the living fountain of
God, but of broken cisterns which can hold no water, as the Scripture says.718 But they are
cisterns broken, and holding no water, which your own teachers have digged, as the Scripture
also expressly asserts, ‘teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.’719 And besides,
they beguile themselves and you, supposing that the everlasting kingdom will be assuredly
given to those of the dispersion who are of Abraham, after the flesh, although they be sinners,
and faithless, and disobedient towards God, which the Scriptures have proved is not the
case. For if so, Isaiah would never have said this: ‘And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left
us a seed, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.’720 And Ezekiel: ‘Even if Noah,
and Jacob, and Daniel were to pray for sons or daughters, their request should not be granted.’
721 ‘But neither shall the father perish for the son, nor the son for the father; but every
one for his own sin, and each shall be saved for his own righteousness.’722 And again Isaiah
says: ‘They shall look on the carcases723 of them that have transgressed: their worm shall
not cease, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.’724
And our Lord, according to the will of Him that sent Him, who is the Father and Lord of
all, would not have said, ‘They shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall sit
down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of
the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.’725 Furthermore, I have proved in what
has preceded,726 that those who were foreknown to be unrighteous, whether men or angels,
are not made wicked by God’s fault, but each man by his own fault is what he will appear
to be.</p>

<p>“But that you may not have a pretext for saying that Christ must have been crucified,
and that those who transgressed must have been among your nation, and that the matter
could not have been otherwise, I said briefly by anticipation, that God, wishing men and
angels to follow His will, resolved to create them free to do righteousness; possessing reason,
that they may know by whom they are created, and through whom they, not existing formerly,
do now exist; and with a law that they should be judged by Him, if they do anything contrary
to right reason: and of ourselves we, men and angels, shall be convicted of having acted
sinfully, unless we repent beforehand. But if the word of God foretells that some angels and
men shall be certainly punished, it did so because it foreknew that they would be unchangeably
[wicked], but not because God had created them so. So that if they repent, all who wish
for it can obtain mercy from God: and the Scripture foretells that they shall be blessed, saying,
‘Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin;’727 that is, having repented of his
sins, that he may receive remission of them from God; and not as you deceive yourselves,
and some others who resemble you in this, who say, that even though they be sinners, but
know God, the Lord will not impute sin to them. We have as proof of this the one fall of
David, which happened through his boasting, which was forgiven then when he so mourned
and wept, as it is written. But if even to such a man no remission was granted before repentance,
and only when this great king, and anointed one, and prophet, mourned and conducted
himself so, how can the impure and utterly abandoned, if they weep not, and mourn not,
and repent not, entertain the hope that the Lord will not impute to them sin? And this one
fall of David, in the matter of Uriah’s wife, proves, sirs,” I said, “that the patriarchs had many
wives, not to commit fornication, but that a certain dispensation and all mysteries might
be accomplished by them; since, if it were allowable to take any wife, or as many wives as
one chooses, and how he chooses, which the men of your nation do over all the earth,
wherever they sojourn, or wherever they have been sent, taking women under the name of
marriage, much more would David have been permitted to do this.”</p>

conference; and I think that these are of quite the same opinion as myself. For we have found

<pb n="721"/>
<head>Chapter I.—Justin justifies his departure from Greek customs.</head>
<p>Do not suppose, ye Greeks, that my separation from your customs is unreasonable and
unthinking; for I found in them nothing that is holy or acceptable to God. For the very
compositions of your poets are monuments of madness and intemperance. For any one
who becomes the scholar of your most eminent instructor, is more beset by difficulties than
all men besides. For first they say that Agamemnon, abetting the extravagant lust of his
brother, and his madness and unrestrained desire, readily gave even his daughter to be sacrificed,
and troubled all Greece that he might rescue Helen, who had been ravished by the
leprous729 shepherd. But when in the course of the war they took captives, Agamemnon
was himself taken captive by Chryseis, and for Briseis’ sake kindled a feud with the son of
Thetis. And Pelides himself, who crossed the river,730 overthrew Troy, and subdued Hector,
this your hero became the slave of Polyxena, and was conquered by a dead Amazon; and
putting off the god-fabricated armour, and donning the hymeneal robe, he became a sacrifice
of love in the temple of Apollo. And the Ithacan Ulysses made a virtue of a vice.731 And
indeed his sailing past the Sirens732 gave evidence that he was destitute of worthy prudence,
because he could not depend on his prudence for stopping his ears. Ajax, son of Telamon,
who bore the shield of sevenfold ox-hide, went mad when he was defeated in the contest
with Ulysses for the armour. Such things I have no desire to be instructed in. Of such virtue
I am not covetous, that I should believe the myths of Homer. For the whole rhapsody, the
beginning and end both of the Iliad and the Odyssey is—a woman.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Greek theogony exposed.</head>
<p>But since, next to Homer, Hesiod wrote his Works and Days, who will believe his drivelling
theogony? For they say that Chronos, the son of Ouranos,733 in the beginning slew
his father, and possessed himself of his rule; and that, being seized with a panic lest he should
himself suffer in the same way, he preferred devouring his children; but that, by the craft of
the Curetes, Jupiter was conveyed away and kept in secret, and afterwards bound his father
with chains, and divided the empire; Jupiter receiving, as the story goes, the air, and Neptune
the deep, and Pluto the portion of Hades. But Pluto ravished Proserpine; and Ceres sought
her child wandering through the deserts. And this myth was celebrated in the Eleusinian
fire.734 Again, Neptune ravished Melanippe when she was drawing water, besides abusing
a host of Nereids not a few, whose names, were we to recount them, would cost us a multitude
of words. And as for Jupiter, he was a various adulterer, with Antiope as a satyr, with Danaë
as gold, and with Europa as a bull; with Leda, moreover, he assumed wings. For the love of
Semele proved both his unchastity and the jealousy of Semele. And they say that he carried
off the Phrygian Ganymede to be his cup-bearer. These, then, are the exploits of the sons
of Saturn. And your illustrious son of Latona [Apollo], who professed soothsaying, convicted
himself of lying. He pursued Daphne, but did not gain possession of her; and to Hyacinthus,
735 who loved him, he did not foretell his death. And I say nothing of the masculine
character of Minerva, nor of the feminine nature of Bacchus, nor of the fornicating disposition
of Venus. Read to Jupiter, ye Greeks, the law against parricides, and the penalty of
adultery, and the ignominy of pæderasty. Teach Minerva and Diana the works of women,
and Bacchus the works of men. What seemliness is there in a woman’s girding herself with
armour, or in a man’s decorating himself with cymbals, and garlands, and female attire, and
accompanied by a herd of bacchanalian women?</p>

to death the fierce and mighty boar, and was able to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and
brought up from Hades the three-headed dog; who effectually cleansed the huge Augean
building from its dung, and killed the bulls and the stag whose nostrils breathed fire, and
plucked the golden fruit from the tree, and slew the poisonous serpent (and for some reason,
which it is not lawful to utter, killed Achelous, and the guest-slaying Busiris), and crossed
the mountains that he might get water which gave forth an articulate speech, as the story
goes: he who was able to do so many and such like and so great deeds as these, how childishly
he was delighted to be stunned by the cymbals of the satyrs, and to be conquered by the love
of woman, and to be struck on the hips by the laughing Lyda! And at last, not being able to
put off the tunic of Nessus, himself kindling his own funeral pile, so he died. Let Vulcan lay
aside his envy, and not be jealous if he is hated because he is old and club-footed, and Mars
loved, because young and beautiful. Since, therefore, ye Greeks, your gods are convicted of
intemperance, and your heroes are effeminate, as the histories on which your dramas are
founded have declared, such as the curse of Atreus, the bed of Thyestes737 and the taint in
the house of Pelops, and Danaus murdering through hatred and making Ægyptus childless
in the intoxication of his rage, and the Thyestean banquet spread by the Furies.738 And
Procne is to this day flitting about, lamenting; and her sister of Athens shrills with her tongue

<head>Chapter V.—Closing appeal.</head>
<p>Henceforth, ye Greeks, come and partake of incomparable wisdom, and be instructed
by the Divine Word, and acquaint yourselves with the King immortal; and do not recognise
those men as heroes who slaughter whole nations. For our own Ruler,740 the Divine Word,
who even now constantly aids us, does not desire strength of body and beauty of feature,
nor yet the high spirit of earth’s nobility, but a pure soul, fortified by holiness, and the
watchwords of our King, holy actions, for through the Word power passes into the soul. O
trumpet of peace to the soul that is at war! O weapon that puttest to flight terrible passions!
O instruction that quenches the innate fire of the soul! The Word exercises an influence
which does not make poets: it does not equip philosophers nor skilled orators, but by its
instruction it makes mortals immortal, mortals gods; and from the earth transports them
to the realms above Olympus. Come, be taught; become as I am, for I, too, was as ye are.741
These have conquered me—the divinity of the instruction, and the power of the Word: for
as a skilled serpent-charmer lures the terrible reptile from his den and causes it to flee, so
the Word drives the fearful passions of our sensual nature from the very recesses of the soul;
first driving forth lust, through which every ill is begotten—hatreds, strife, envy, emulations,
anger, and such like. Lust being once banished, the soul becomes calm and serene. And being
set free from the ills in which it was sunk up to the neck, it returns to Him who made it. For
it is fit that it be restored to that state whence it departed, whence every soul was or is.742</p>

  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="727"/>
<head>Chapter I.—Reasons for addressing the Greeks.</head>
<p>As I begin this hortatory address to you, ye men of Greece, I pray God that I may know
what I ought to say to you, and that you, shaking off your habitual743 love of disputing, and
being delivered from the error of your fathers, may now choose what is profitable; not
fancying that you commit any offence against your forefathers, though the things which
you formerly considered by no means salutary should now seem useful to you. For accurate
investigation of matters, putting truth to the question with a more searching scrutiny, often
reveals that things which have passed for excellent are of quite another sort. Since, then, we
propose to discourse of the true religion (than which, I think, there is nothing which is
counted more valuable by those who desire to pass through life without danger, on account
of the judgment which is to be after the termination of this life, and which is announced
not only by our forefathers according to God, to wit the prophets and lawgivers, but also
by those among yourselves who have been esteemed wise, not poets alone, but also philosophers,
who professed among you that they had attained the true and divine knowledge),
I think it well first of all to examine the teachers of religion, both our own and yours, who
they were, and how great, and in what times they lived; in order that those who have formerly
received from their fathers the false religion, may now, when they perceive this, be extricated
from that inveterate error; and that we may clearly and manifestly show that we ourselves
follow the religion of our forefathers according to God.</p>

  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="728"/>
<head>Chapter II—The poets are unfit to be religious teachers.</head>
<p>Whom, then, ye men of Greece, do ye call your teachers of religion? The poets? It will
do your cause no good to say so to men who know the poets; for they know how very ridiculous
a theogony they have composed,—as we can learn from Homer, your most distinguished
and prince of poets. For he says, first, that the gods were in the beginning generated from
water; for he has written thus:744—
<lg>
<l>"Both ocean, the origin of the gods, and their mother Tethys”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And then we must also remind you of what he further says of him whom ye consider
the first of the gods, and whom he often calls “the father of gods and men;” for he said:745—
<lg>
<l>“Zeus, who is the dispenser of war to men.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Indeed, he says that he was not only the dispenser of war to the army, but also the cause
of perjury to the Trojans, by means of his daughter;746 and Homer introduces him in love,
and bitterly complaining, and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the other gods, and
at one time exclaiming concerning his own son:747—
<lg>
<l>“Alas! he falls, my most beloved of men!</l>
<l>Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls.</l>
<l>So will the fates.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And at another time concerning Hector:748—
<lg>
<l>“Ah! I behold a warrior dear to me</l>
<l>Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve</l>
<l>For Hector.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And what he says of the conspiracy of the other gods against Zeus, they know who read
these words:749 “When the other Olympians—Juno, and Neptune, and Minerva —wished
<note type="footnote">744 Iliad, xiv. 302.</note>

to bind him.” And unless the blessed gods had feared him whom gods call Briareus, Zeus
would have been bound by them. And what Homer says of his intemperate loves, we must
remind you in the very words he used. For he said that Zeus spake thus to Juno:750—
<lg>
<l>“For never goddess pour’d, nor woman yet,</l>
<l>So full a tide of love into my breast;</l>
<l>I never loved Ixion’s consort thus,</l>
<l>Nor sweet Acrisian Danaë, from whom</l>
<l>Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;</l>
<l>Nor Phoenix’ daughter fair, of whom were born</l>
<l>Minos, unmatch’d but by the powers above,</l>
<l>And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,</l>
<l>Nor yet Alcmene, who in Thebes produced</l>
<l>The valiant Hercules; and though my son</l>
<l>By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man;</l>
<l>Nor Ceres golden-hair’d, nor high-enthron’d</l>
<l>Latona in the skies; no—nor thyself</l>
<l>As now I love thee, and my soul perceive</l>
<l>O’erwhelm’d with sweetness of intense desire.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>It is fit that we now mention what one can learn from the work of Homer of the other
gods, and what they suffered at the hands of men. For he says that Mars and Venus were
wounded by Diomed, and of many others of the gods he relates the sufferings. For thus we
can gather from the case of Dione consoling her daughter; for she said to her:751—
<lg>
<l>“Have patience, dearest child; though much enforc’d</l>
<l>Restrain thine anger: we, in heav’n who dwell,</l>
<l>Have much to bear from mortals; and ourselves</l>
<l>Too oft upon each other suff’rings lay:</l>
<l>Mars had his suff’rings; by Alöeus' sons,</l>
<l>Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,</l>
<l>He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay:</l>
<l>Juno, too, suffer’d, when Amphitryon’s son</l>
<l>Thro’ her right breast a three-barb’d arrow sent:</l>
<l>Dire, and unheard of, were the pangs she bore,</l>

two lines are omitted.)</note>

<pb n="730"/>
<lg>
<l>Great Pluto’s self the stinging arrow felt,</l>
<l>When that same son of Ægis-bearing Jove</l>
<l>Assail’d him in the very gates of hell,</l>
<l>And wrought him keenest anguish; pierced with pain,</l>
<l>To high Olympus, to the courts of Jove,</l>
<l>Groaning, he came; the bitter shaft remain’d</l>
<l>Deep in his shoulder fix’d, and griev’d his soul."</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But if it is right to remind you of the battle of the gods, opposed to one another, your
own poet himself will recount it, saying:752—
<lg>
<l>“Such was the shock when gods in battle met;</l>
<l>For there to royal Neptune stood oppos’d</l>
<l>Phoebus Apollo with his arrows keen;</l>
<l>The blue-eyed Pallas to the god of war;</l>
<l>To Juno, Dian, heav’nly archeress,</l>
<l>Sister of Phoebus, golden-shafted queen.</l>
<l>Stout Hermes, helpful god, Latona fac’d.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>These and such like things did Homer teach you; and not Homer only, but also Hesiod.
So that if you believe your most distinguished poets, who have given the genealogies of your
gods, you must of necessity either suppose that the gods are such beings as these, or believe
that there are no gods at all.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Opinions of the school of Thales.</head>
<p>And if you decline citing the poets, because you say it is allowable for them to frame
myths, and to relate in a mythical way many things about the gods which are far from true,
do you suppose you have some others for your religious teachers, or how do you say that
they themselves753 have learned this religion of yours? For it is impossible that any should
know matters so great and divine, who have not themselves learned them first from the
initiated.754 You will no doubt say, “The sages and philosophers.” For to them, as to a fortified
wall, you are wont to flee, when any one quotes the opinions of your poets about the gods.
Therefore, since it is fit that we commence with the ancients and the earliest, beginning
thence I will produce the opinion of each, much more ridiculous as it is than the theology
of the poets. For Thales of Miletus, who took the lead in the study of natural philosophy,
declared that water was the first principle of all things; for from water he says that all things
are, and that into water all are resolved. And after him Anaximander, who came from the
same Miletus, said that the infinite was the first principle of all things; for that from this
indeed all things are produced, and into this do all decay. Thirdly, Anaximenes—and he
too was from Miletus—says that air is the first principle of all things; for he says that from
this all things are produced, and into this all are resolved. Heraclitus and Hippasus, from
Metapontus, say that fire is the first principle of all things; for from fire all things proceed,
and in fire do all things terminate. Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ said that the homogeneous
parts are the first principles of all things. Archelaus, the son of Apollodorus, an Athenian,
says that the infinite air and its density and rarity are the first principle of all things. All
these, forming a succession from Thales, followed the philosophy called by themselves
physical.</p>

  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="732"/>
<head>Chapter IV.—Opinions of Pythagoras and Epicurus.</head>
<p>Then, in regular succession from another starting-point, Pythagoras the Samian, son
of Mnesarchus, calls numbers, with their proportions and harmonies, and the elements
composed of both, the first principles; and he includes also unity and the indefinite binary.755
Epicurus, an Athenian, the son of Neocles, says that the first principles of the things that
exist are bodies perceptible by reason, admitting no vacuity,756 unbegotten, indestructible,
which can neither be broken, nor admit of any formation of their parts, nor alteration, and
are therefore perceptible by reason. Empedocles of Agrigentum, son of Meton, maintained
that there were four elements—fire, air, water, earth; and two elementary powers —love
and hate,757 of which the former is a power of union, the latter of separation. You see, then,
the confusion of those who are considered by you to have been wise men, whom you assert
to be your teachers of religion: some of them declaring that water is the first principle of all
things; others, air, others, fire; and others, some other of these fore-mentioned elements;
and all of them employing persuasive arguments for the establishment of their own errors,
and attempting to prove their own peculiar dogma to be the most valuable. These things
were said by them. How then, ye men of Greece, can it be safe for those who desire to be
saved, to fancy that they can learn the true religion from these philosophers, who were
neither able so to convince themselves as to prevent sectarian wrangling with one another,
and not to appear definitely opposed to one another’s opinions?</p>
<note type="footnote">755 μονάδα καὶ τὴν ἀόριστον δυάδα. One, or unity, was considered by Pythagoras as the essence of number,
and also as God. Two, or the indefinite binary, was the equivalent of evil. So Plutarch, De placit. philosoph., c.

<head>Chapter V.—Opinions of Plato and Aristotle.</head>
<p>But possibly those who are unwilling to give up the ancient and inveterate error, maintain
that they have received the doctrine of their religion not from those who have now been
mentioned, but from those who are esteemed among them as the most renowned and finished
philosophers, Plato and Aristotle. For these, they say, have learned the perfect and true religion.
But I would be glad to ask, first of all, from those who say so, from whom they say that
these men have learned this knowledge; for it is impossible that men who have not learned
these so great and divine matters from some who knew them, should either themselves
know them, or be able correctly to teach others; and, in the second place, I think we ought
to examine the opinions even of these sages. For we shall see whether each of these does not
manifestly contradict the other. But if we find that even they do not agree with each other,
I think it is easy to see clearly that they too are ignorant. For Plato, with the air of one that
has descended from above, and has accurately ascertained and seen all that is in heaven,
says that the most high God exists in a fiery substance.758 But Aristotle, in a book addressed
to Alexander of Macedon, giving a compendious explanation of his own philosophy, clearly
and manifestly overthrows the opinion of Plato, saying that God does not exist in a fiery
substance: but inventing, as a fifth substance, some kind of ætherial and unchangeable body,
says that God exists in it. Thus, at least, he wrote: “Not, as some of those who have erred
regarding the Deity say, that God exists in a fiery substance.” Then, as if he were not satisfied
with this blasphemy against Plato, he further, for the sake of proving what he says about the
ætherial body, cites as a witness him whom Plato had banished from his republic as a liar,
and as being an imitator of the images of truth at three removes,759 for so Plato calls Homer;
for he wrote: “Thus at least did Homer speak,760 ‘And Zeus obtained the wide heaven in
the air and the clouds,’ ” wishing to make his own opinion appear more worthy of credit by
the testimony of Homer; not being aware that if he used Homer as a witness to prove that
he spoke truth, many of his tenets would be proved untrue. For Thales of Miletus, who was
the founder of philosophy among them, taking occasion from him,761 will contradict his
first opinions about first principles. For Aristotle himself, having said that God and matter
are the first principles of all things, Thales, the eldest of all their sages, says that water is the
first principle of the things that exist; for he says that all things are from water, and that all
<note type="footnote">758 Or, “is of a fiery nature.”</note>
<note type="footnote">759 See the Platonic doctrine, the ideas of things in the mind of God were the realities;
the things themselves, as seen by us, were the images of these realities; and poetry, therefore, describing the
images of realities, was only at the third remove from nature. As Plato puts it briefly in this same passage, “the
painter, the bed-maker, God—these three are the masters of three species of beds.”</note>

things are resolved into water. And he conjectures this, first, from the fact that the seed of
all living creatures, which is their first principle, is moist; and secondly, because all plants
grow and bear fruit in moisture, but when deprived of moisture, wither. Then, as if not
satisfied with his conjectures, he cites Homer as a most trustworthy testimony, who speaks
thus:—
<lg>
<l>“Ocean, who is the origin of all.”762</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>May not Thales, then, very fairly say to him, “What is the reason, Aristotle, why you
give heed to Homer, as if he spoke truth, when you wish to demolish the opinions of Plato;
but when you promulgate an opinion contrary to ours, you think Homer untruthful?”</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Further disagreements between Plato and Aristotle.</head>
<p>And that these very wonderful sages of yours do not even agree in other respects, can
be easily learned from this. For while Plato says that there are three first principles of all
things, God, and matter, and form,—God, the maker of all; and matter, which is the subject
of the first production of all that is produced, and affords to God opportunity for His
workmanship; and form, which is the type of each of the things produced,— Aristotle makes
no mention at all of form as a first principle, but says that there are two, God and matter.
And again, while Plato says that the highest God and the ideas exist in the first place of the
highest heavens, and in fixed sphere, Aristotle says that, next to the most high God, there
are, not ideas, but certain gods, who can be perceived by the mind. Thus, then, do they differ
concerning things heavenly. So that one can see that they not only are unable to understand
our earthly matters, but also, being at variance among themselves regarding these things,
they will appear unworthy of credit when they treat of things heavenly. And that even their
doctrine regarding the human soul as it now is does not harmonize, is manifest from what
has been said by each of them concerning it. For Plato says that it is of three parts, having
the faculty of reason, of affection, and of appetite.763 But Aristotle says that the soul is not
so comprehensive as to include also corruptible parts, but only reason. And Plato loudly
maintains that “the whole soul is immortal.” But Aristotle, naming it “the actuality,”764
would have it to be mortal, not immortal. And the former says it is always in motion; but
Aristotle says that it is immoveable, since it must itself precede all motion.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Inconsistencies of Plato’s doctrine.</head>
<p>But in these things they are convicted of thinking in contradiction to each other. And
if any one will accurately criticise their writings, they have chosen to abide in harmony not
even with their own opinions. Plato, at any rate, at one time says that there are three first
principles of the universe—God, and matter, and form; but at another time four, for he adds
the universal soul. And again, when he has already said that matter is eternal,765 he afterwards
says that it is produced; and when he has first given to form its peculiar rank as a first principle,
and has asserted for its self-subsistence, he afterwards says that this same thing is
among the things perceived by the understanding. Moreover, having first declared that
everything that is made is mortal766 he afterwards states that some of the things that are
made are indestructible and immortal. What, then, is the cause why those who have been
esteemed wise among you disagree not only with one another but also with themselves?
Manifestly, their unwillingness to learn from those who know, and their desire to attain
accurate knowledge of things heavenly by their own human excess of wisdom though they
were able to understand not even earthly matters. Certainly some of your philosophers say
that the human soul is in us; others, that it is around us. For not even in this did they choose
to agree with one another, but, distributing, as it were, ignorance in various ways among
themselves, they thought fit to wrangle and dispute with one another even about the soul.
For some of them say that the soul is fire, and some that it is the air; and others, the mind;
and others, motion; and others, an exhalation; and certain others say that it is a power
flowing from the stars; and others, number capable of motion; and others, a generating
water. And a wholly confused and inharmonious opinion has prevailed among them, which
only in this one respect appears praiseworthy to those who can form a right judgment, that
they have been anxious to convict one another of error and falsehood.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Antiquity, inspiration, and harmony of Christian teachers.</head>
<p>Since therefore it is impossible to learn anything true concerning religion from your
teachers, who by their mutual disagreement have furnished you with sufficient proof of
their own ignorance, I consider it reasonable to recur to our progenitors, who both in point
of time have by a great way the precedence of your teachers, and who have taught us nothing
from their own private fancy, nor differed with one another, nor attempted to overturn one
another’s positions, but without wrangling and contention received from God the knowledge
which also they taught to us. For neither by nature nor by human conception is it possible
for men to know things so great and divine, but by the gift which then descended from
above upon the holy men, who had no need of rhetorical art,767 nor of uttering anything
in a contentious or quarrelsome manner, but to present themselves pure768 to the energy
of the Divine Spirit, in order that the divine plectrum itself, descending from heaven, and
using righteous men as an instrument like a harp or lyre, might reveal to us the knowledge
of things divine and heavenly. Wherefore, as if with one mouth and one tongue, they have
in succession, and in harmony with one another, taught us both concerning God, and the
creation of the world, and the formation of man, and concerning the immortality of the
human soul, and the judgment which is to be after this life, and concerning all things which
it is needful for us to know, and thus in divers times and places have afforded us the divine
instruction.769</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The antiquity of Moses proved by Greek writers.</head>
<p>I will begin, then, with our first prophet and lawgiver, Moses; first explaining the times
in which he lived, on authorities which among you are worthy of all credit. For I do not
propose to prove these things only from our own divine histories, which as yet you are unwilling
to credit on account of the inveterate error of your forefathers, but also from your
own histories, and such, too, as have no reference to our worship, that you may know that,
of all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or lawgivers, by far the
oldest, as the Greek histories show us, was Moses, who was our first religious teacher.770
For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets suppose to have been
earth-born,771 Moses is mentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. For in this
way he is mentioned both by Polemon in the first book of his Hellenics, and by Apion son
of Posidonius in his book against the Jews, and in the fourth book of his history, where he
says that during the reign of Inachus over Argos the Jews revolted from Amasis king of the
Egyptians, and that Moses led them. And Ptolemæus the Mendesian, in relating the history
of Egypt, concurs in all this. And those who write the Athenian history, Hellanicus and
Philochorus (the author of The Attic History), Castor and Thallus, and Alexander Polyhistor,
and also the very well informed writers on Jewish affairs, Philo and Josephus, have mentioned
Moses as a very ancient and time-honoured prince of the Jews. Josephus, certainly, desiring
to signify even by the title of his work the antiquity and age of the history, wrote thus at the
commencement of the history: “The Jewish antiquities772 of Flavius Josephus,”—signifying
the oldness of the history by the word “antiquities.” And your most renowned historian
Diodorus, who employed thirty whole years in epitomizing the libraries, and who, as he
himself wrote, travelled over both Asia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, and thus
became an eye-witness of very many things, wrote forty entire books of his own history.
And he in the first book, having said that he had learned from the Egyptian priests that
Moses was an ancient lawgiver, and even the first, wrote of him in these very words: “For
subsequent to the ancient manner of living in Egypt which gods and heroes are fabled to
have regulated, they say that Moses773 first persuaded the people to use written laws, and
to live by them; and he is recorded to have been a man both great of soul and of great faculty
in social matters.” Then, having proceeded a little further, and wishing to mention the ancient
lawgivers, he mentions Moses first. For he spoke in these words: “Among the Jews they say
that Moses ascribed his laws774 to that God who is called Jehovah, whether because they

<note type="footnote">773 Unfortunately, Justin here mistook Menes for Moses. [But he may have so read the name in his copy. See

judged it a marvellous and quite divine conception which promised to benefit a multitude
of men, or because they were of opinion that the people would be the more obedient when
they contemplated the majesty and power of those who were said to have invented the laws.
And they say that Sasunchis was the second Egyptian legislator, a man of excellent understanding.
And the third, they say, was Sesonchosis the king, who not only performed the
most brilliant military exploits of any in Egypt, but also consolidated that warlike race by
legislation. And the fourth lawgiver, they say, was Bocchoris the king, a wise and surpassingly
skilful man. And after him it is said that Amasis the king acceded to the government, whom
they relate to have regulated all that pertains to the rulers of provinces, and to the general
administration of the government of Egypt. And they say that Darius, the father of Xerxes,
was the sixth who legislated for the Egyptians.”</p>

<head>Chapter X—Training and inspiration of Moses.775</head>
<p>These things, ye men of Greece, have been recorded in writing concerning the antiquity
of Moses by those who were not of our religion; and they said that they learned all these
things from the Egyptian priests, among whom Moses was not only born, but also was
thought worthy of partaking of all the education of the Egyptians, on account of his being
adopted by the king’s daughter as her son; and for the same reason was thought worthy of
great attention, as the wisest of the historians relate, who have chosen to record his life and
actions, and the rank of his descent, —I speak of Philo and Josephus. For these, in their
narration of the history of the Jews, say that Moses was sprung from the race of the
Chaldæans, and that he was born in Egypt when his forefathers had migrated on account
of famine from Phoenicia to that country; and him God chose to honour on account of his
exceeding virtue, and judged him worthy to become the leader and lawgiver of his own race,
when He thought it right that the people of the Hebrews should return out of Egypt into
their own land. To him first did God communicate that divine and prophetic gift which in
those days descended upon the holy men, and him also did He first furnish that he might
be our teacher in religion, and then after him the rest of the prophets, who both obtained
the same gift as he, and taught us the same doctrines concerning the same subjects. These
we assert to have been our teachers, who taught us nothing from their own human conception,
but from the gift vouchsafed to them by God from above.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Heathen oracles testify of Moses.</head>
<p>But as you do not see the necessity of giving up the ancient error of your forefathers in
obedience to these teachers [of ours], what teachers of your own do you maintain to have
lived worthy of credit in the matter of religion? For, as I have frequently said, it is impossible
that those who have not themselves learned these so great and divine things from such
persons as are acquainted with them, should either themselves know them, or be able rightly
to teach others. Since, therefore, it has been sufficiently proved that the opinions of your
philosophers are obviously full of all ignorance and deceit, having now perhaps wholly
abandoned the philosophers as formerly you abandoned the poets, you will turn to the deceit
of the oracles; for in this style I have heard some speaking. Therefore I think it fit to tell you
at this step in our discourse what I formerly heard among you concerning their utterances.
For when one inquired at your oracle—it is your own story—what religious men had at any
time happened to live, you say that the oracle answered thus: “Only the Chaldæans have
obtained wisdom, and the Hebrews, who worship God Himself, the self-begotten King.”</p>
<p>Since, therefore, you think that the truth can be learned from your oracles, when you
read the histories and what has been written regarding the life of Moses by those who do
not belong to our religion, and when you know that Moses and the rest of the prophets were
descended from the race of the Chaldæans and Hebrews, do not think that anything incredible
has taken place if a man sprung from a godly line, and who lived worthily of the godliness
of his fathers, was chosen by God to be honoured with this great gift and to be set forth as
the first of all the prophets.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Antiquity of Moses proved.</head>
<p>And I think it necessary also to consider the times in which your philosophers lived,
that you may see that the time which produced them for you is very recent, and also short.
For thus you will be able easily to recognise also the antiquity of Moses. But lest, by a complete
survey of the periods, and by the use of a greater number of proofs, I should seem to be
prolix, I think it may be sufficiently demonstrated from the following. For Socrates was the
teacher of Plato, and Plato of Aristotle. Now these men flourished in the time of Philip and
Alexander of Macedon, in which time also the Athenian orators flourished, as the Philippics
of Demosthenes plainly show us. And those who have narrated the deeds of Alexander
sufficiently prove that during his reign Aristotle associated with him. From all manner of
proofs, then, it is easy to see that the history of Moses is by far more ancient than all profane776
histories. And, besides, it is fit that you recognise this fact also, that nothing has
been accurately recorded by Greeks before the era of the Olympiads, and that there is no
ancient work which makes known any action of the Greeks or Barbarians. But before that
period existed only the history of the prophet Moses, which he wrote in the Hebrew character
by the divine inspiration. For the Greek character was not yet in use, as the teachers of language
themselves prove, telling us that Cadmus first brought the letters from Phoenicia, and
communicated them to the Greeks. And your first of philosophers, Plato, testifies that they
were a recent discovery. For in the Timæus777 he wrote that Solon, the wisest of the wise
men, on his return from Egypt, said to Critias that he had heard this from a very aged
Egyptian priest, who said to him, “O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are ever children, and aged
Greek there is none.” Then again he said, “You are all youths in soul, for you hold no ancient
opinion derived through remote tradition, nor any system of instruction hoary with time;
but all these things escape your knowledge, because for many generations the posterity of
these ancient ages died mute, not having the use of letters.” It is fit, therefore, that you understand
that it is the fact that every history has been written in these recently-discovered
Greek letters; and if any one would make mention of old poets, or legislators, or historians,
or philosophers, or orators, he will find that they wrote their own works in the Greek character.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—History of the Septuagint.</head>
<p>But if any one says that the writings of Moses and of the rest of the prophets were also
written in the Greek character, let him read profane histories, and know that Ptolemy, king
of Egypt, when he had built the library in Alexandria, and by gathering books from every
quarter had filled it, then learnt that very ancient histories written in Hebrew happened to
be carefully preserved; and wishing to know their contents, he sent for seventy wise men
from Jerusalem, who were acquainted with both the Greek and Hebrew language, and ap-
pointed them to translate the books; and that in freedom from all disturbance they might
the more speedily complete the translation, he ordered that there should be constructed,
not in the city itself, but seven stadia off (where the Pharos was built), as many little cots as
there were translators, so that each by himself might complete his own translation; and enjoined
upon those officers who were appointed to this duty, to afford them all attendance,
but to prevent communication with one another, in order that the accuracy of the translation
might be discernible even by their agreement. And when he ascertained that the seventy
men had not only given the same meaning, but had employed the same words, and had
failed in agreement with one another not even to the extent of one word; but had written
the same things, and concerning the same things, he was struck with amazement, and believed
that the translation had been written by divine power, and perceived that the men were
worthy of all honour, as beloved of God; and with many gifts ordered them to return to
their own country. And having, as was natural, marvelled at the books, and concluded them
to be divine, he consecrated them in that library. These things, ye men of Greece, are no
fable, nor do we narrate fictions; but we ourselves having been in Alexandria, saw the remains
of the little cots at the Pharos still preserved, and having heard these things from the inhabitants,
who had received them as part of their country’s tradition,778 we now tell to you what
you can also learn from others, and specially from those wise and esteemed men who have
written of these things, Philo and Josephus, and many others. But if any of those who are
wont to be forward in contradiction should say that these books do not belong to us, but to
the Jews, and should assert that we in vain profess to have learnt our religion from them,
let him know, as he may from those very things which are written in these books, that not
to them, but to us, does the doctrine of them refer. That the books relating to our religion
are to this day preserved among the Jews, has been a work of Divine Providence on our behalf;
for lest, by producing them out of the Church, we should give occasion to those who wish
to slander us to charge us with fraud, we demand that they be produced from the synagogue
of the Jews, that from the very books still preserved among them it might clearly and evidently
appear, that the laws which were written by holy men for instruction pertain to us.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary, ye Greeks, that you contemplate the things that are to be, and

who are irreligious, that ye do not without investigation commit yourselves to the error of
your fathers, nor suppose that if they themselves have been in error, and have transmitted
it to you, that this which they have taught you is true; but looking to the danger of so terrible
a mistake, inquire and investigate carefully into those things which are, as you say, spoken
of even by your own teachers. For even unwillingly they were on your account forced to say
many things by the Divine regard for mankind, especially those of them who were in Egypt,
and profited by the godliness of Moses and his ancestry. For I think that some of you, when
you read even carelessly the history of Diodorus, and of those others who wrote of these
things, cannot fail to see that both Orpheus, and Homer, and Solon, who wrote the laws of
the Athenians, and Pythagoras, and Plato, and some others, when they had been in Egypt,
and had taken advantage of the history of Moses, afterwards published doctrines concerning
the gods quite contrary to those which formerly they had erroneously promulgated.</p>

<p>At all events, we must remind you what Orpheus, who was, as one might say, your first
teacher of polytheism, latterly addressed to his son Musæus, and to the other legitimate
auditors, concerning the one and only God. And he spoke thus:—
<lg>
<l>“I speak to those who lawfully may hear:</l>
<l>All others, ye profane, now close the doors,</l>
<l>And, O Musæus! hearken thou to me,</l>
<l>Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon:</l>
<l>The words I utter now are true indeed;</l>
<l>And if thou former thoughts of mine hast seen,</l>
<l>Let them not rob thee of the blessed life,</l>
<l>But rather turn the depths of thine own heart</l>
<l>Unto the place where light and knowledge dwell.</l>
<l>Take thou the word divine to guide thy steps,</l>
<l>And walking well in the straight certain path,</l>
<l>Look to the one and universal King—</l>
<l>One, self-begotten, and the only One,</l>
<l>Of whom all things and we ourselves are sprung.</l>
<l>All things are open to His piercing gaze,</l>
<l>While He Himself is still invisible.</l>
<l>Present in all His works, though still unseen,</l>
<l>He gives to mortals evil out of good,</l>
<l>Sending both chilling wars and tearful griefs;</l>
<l>And other than the great King there is none.</l>
<l>The clouds for ever settle round His throne,</l>
<l>And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes</l>
<l>Are weak, to see Jove reigning over all.</l>
<l>He sits established in the brazen heavens</l>
<l>Upon His golden throne; under His feet</l>
<l>He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand</l>
<l>To all the ends of ocean, and around</l>
<l>Tremble the mountain ranges and the streams,</l>
<l>The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And again, in some other place he says:—
<lg>
<l>“There is one Zeus alone, one sun, one hell,</l>
<l>One Bacchus; and in all things but one God;</l>
</lg>

<pb n="746"/>
<lg>
<l>Nor of all these as diverse let me speak.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And when he swears he says:—
<lg>
<l>“Now I adjure thee by the highest heaven,</l>
<l>The work of the great God, the only wise;</l>
<l>And I adjure thee by the Father’s voice.</l>
<l>Which first He uttered when He stablished</l>
<l>The whole world by His counsel.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>What does he mean by “I adjure thee by the Father’s voice, which first He uttered?” It
is the Word of God which he here names “the voice,” by whom heaven and earth and the
whole creation were made, as the divine prophecies of the holy men teach us; and these he
himself also paid some attention to in Egypt, and understood that all creation was made by
the Word of God; and therefore, after he says, “I adjure thee by the Father’s voice, which
first He uttered,” he adds this besides, “when by His counsel He established the whole world.”
Here he calls the Word “voice,” for the sake of the poetical metre. And that this is so, is
manifest from the fact, that a little further on, where the metre permits him, he names it
“Word.” For he said:—
<lg>
<l>“Take thou the Word divine to guide thy steps.”</l>

</lg>
</p>
<p>Then elsewhere thus:—
<lg>
<l>“But we have strayed from the Immortal’s ways,</l>
<l>And worship with a dull and senseless mind</l>
<l>Idols, the workmanship of our own hands,</l>
<l>And images and figures of dead men.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And again somewhere else:—
<lg>
<l>“Blessed shall be those men upon the earth</l>
<l>Who shall love the great God before all else,</l>
<l>Blessing Him when they eat and when they drink;</l>
<l>Trusting in this their piety alone.</l>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Testimony of Homer.</head>
<p>And the poet Homer, using the license of poetry, and rivalling the original opinion of
Orpheus regarding the plurality of the gods, mentions, indeed, several gods in a mythical
style, lest he should seem to sing in a different strain from the poem of Orpheus, which he
so distinctly proposed to rival, that even in the first line of his poem he indicated the relation
he held to him. For as Orpheus in the beginning of his poem had said, “O goddess, sing the
wrath of Demeter, who brings the goodly fruit,” Homer began thus, “O goddess, sing the
wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus,” preferring, as it seems to me, even to violate the poetical
metre in his first line, than that he should seem not to have remembered before all else the
names of the gods. But shortly after he also clearly and explicitly presents his own opinion
regarding one God only, somewhere779 saying to Achilles by the mouth of Phoenix, “Not
though God Himself were to promise that He would peel off my old age, and give me the
vigour of my youth,” where he indicates by the pronoun the real and true God. And somewhere780
he makes Ulysses address the host of the Greeks thus: “The rule of many is not a
good thing; let there be one ruler.” And that the rule of many is not a good thing, but on

<l>“There is one God, in truth there is but one,</l>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Testimony of Pythagoras.</head>
<p>And Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, who expounded the doctrines of his own philosophy,
mystically by means of symbols, as those who have written his life show, himself
seems to have entertained thoughts about the unity of God not unworthy of his foreign
residence in Egypt. For when he says that unity is the first principle of all things, and that
it is the cause of all good, he teaches by an allegory that God is one, and alone.781 And that
this is so, is evident from his saying that unity and one differ widely from one another. For
he says that unity belongs to the class of things perceived by the mind, but that one belongs
to numbers. And if you desire to see a clearer proof of the opinion of Pythagoras concerning
one God, hear his own opinion, for he spoke as follows: “God is one; and He Himself does
not, as some suppose, exist outside the world, but in it, He being wholly present in the whole
circle, and beholding all generations; being the regulating ingredient of all the ages, and the
administrator of His own powers and works, the first principle of all things, the light of
heaven, and Father of all, the intelligence and animating soul of the universe, the movement
of all orbits.”

<head>Chapter XX.—Testimony of Plato.</head>
<p>But Plato, though he accepted, as is likely, the doctrine of Moses and the other prophets
regarding one only God, which he learned while in Egypt, yet fearing, on account of what
had befallen Socrates, lest he also should raise up some Anytus or Meletus against himself,
who should accuse him before the Athenians, and say, “Plato is doing harm, and making
himself mischievously busy, not acknowledging the gods recognised by the state;” in fear
of the hemlock-juice, contrives an elaborate and ambiguous discourse concerning the gods,
furnishing by his treatise gods to those who wish them, and none for those who are differently
disposed, as may readily be seen from his own statements. For when he has laid down that
everything that is made is mortal, he afterwards says that the gods were made. If, then, he
would have God and matter to be the origin of all things, manifestly it is inevitably necessary
to say that the gods were made of matter; but if of matter, out of which he said that evil also
had its origin, he leaves right-thinking persons to consider what kind of beings the gods
should be thought who are produced out of matter. For, for this very reason did he say that
matter was eternal,782 that he might not seem to say that God is the creator of evil. And regarding
the gods who were made by God, there is no doubt he said this: “Gods of gods, of
whom I am the creator.” And he manifestly held the correct opinion concerning the really
existing God. For having heard in Egypt that God had said to Moses, when He was about
to send him to the Hebrews, “I am that I am,”783 he understood that God had not mentioned
to him His own proper name.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The namelessness of God.</head>
<p>For God cannot be called by any proper name, for names are given to mark out and
distinguish their subject-matters, because these are many and diverse; but neither did any
one exist before God who could give Him a name, nor did He Himself think it right to name
Himself, seeing that He is one and unique, as He Himself also by His own prophets testifies,
when He says, “I God am the first,” and after this, “And beside me there is no other God.”784
On this account, then, as I before said, God did not, when He sent Moses to the Hebrews,
mention any name, but by a participle He mystically teaches them that He is the one and
only God. “For,” says He; “I am the Beingi;” manifestly contrasting Himself, “the Being,”
with those who are not,785 that those who had hitherto been deceived might see that they
were attaching themselves, not to beings, but to those who had no being. Since, therefore,
God knew that the first men remembered the old delusion of their forefathers, whereby the
misanthropic demon contrived to deceive them when he said to them, “If ye obey me in
transgressing the commandment of God, ye shall be as gods,” calling those gods which had
no being, in order that men, supposing that there were other gods in existence, might believe
that they themselves could become gods. On this account He said to Moses, “I am the Being,”
that by the participle “being” He might teach the difference between God who is and those
who are not.786 Men, therefore, having been duped by the deceiving demon, and having
dared to disobey God, were cast out of Paradise, remembering the name of gods, but no
longer being taught by God that there are no other gods. For it was not just that they who
did not keep the first commandment, which it was easy to keep, should any longer be taught,
but should rather be driven to just punishment. Being therefore banished from Paradise,
and thinking that they were expelled on account of their disobedience only, not knowing
that it was also because they had believed in the existence of gods which did not exist, they
gave the name of gods even to the men who were afterwards born of themselves. This first
false fancy, therefore, concerning gods, had its origin with the father of lies. God, therefore,
knowing that the false opinion about the plurality of gods was burdening the soul of man
like some disease, and wishing to remove and eradicate it, appeared first to Moses, and said
to him, “I am He who is.” For it was necessary, I think, that he who was to be the ruler and
leader of the Hebrew people should first of all know the living God. Wherefore, having appeared
to him first, as it was possible for God to appear to a man, He said to him, “I am He

<head>Chapter XXII.—Studied ambiguity of Plato.</head>
<p>Plato accordingly having learned this in Egypt, and being greatly taken with what was
said about one God, did indeed consider it unsafe to mention the name of Moses, on account
of his teaching the doctrine of one only God, for he dreaded the Areopagus; but what is very
well expressed by him in his elaborate treatise, the Timæus, he has written in exact correspondence
with what Moses said regarding God, though he has done so, not as if he had
learned it from him, but as if he were expressing his own opinion. For he said, “In my
opinion, then, we must first define what that is which exists eternally, and has no generation,
787 and what that is which is always being generated, but never really is.” Does not this,
ye men of Greece, seem to those who are able to understand the matter to be one and the
same thing, saving only the difference of the article? For Moses said, “He who is,” and Plato,
“That which is.” But either of the expressions seems to apply to the ever-existent God. For
He is the only one who eternally exists, and has no generation. What, then, that other thing
is which is contrasted with the ever-existent, and of which he said, “And what that is which
is always being generated, but never really is,” we must attentively consider. For we shall
find him clearly and evidently saying that He who is unbegotten is eternal, but that those
that are begotten and made are generated and perish788—as he said of the same class, “gods
of gods, of whom I am maker”—for he speaks in the following words: “In my opinion, then,
we must first define what that is which is always existent and has no birth, and what that is
which is always being generated but never really is. The former, indeed, which is apprehended
by reflection combined with reason, always exists in the same way;789 while the latter, on
the other hand, is conjectured by opinion formed by the perception of the senses unaided
by reason, since it never really is, but is coming into being and perishing.” These expressions
declare to those who can rightly understand them the death and destruction of the gods
that have been brought into being. And I think it necessary to attend to this also, that Plato
never names him the creator, but the fashioner790 of the gods, although, in the opinion of
Plato, there is considerable difference between these two. For the creator creates the creature
by his own capability and power, being in need of nothing else; but the fashioner frames his
production when he has received from matter the capability for his work.</p>
<note type="footnote">787 That is, “is not produced or created; has no birth.”</note>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Plato’s self-contradiction.</head>
<p>But, perhaps, some who are unwilling to abandon the doctrines of polytheism, will say
that to these fashioned gods the maker said, “Since ye have been produced, ye are not immortal,
nor at all imperishable; yet shall ye not perish nor succumb to the fatality of death,
because you have obtained my will,791 which is a still greater and mightier bond.” Here
Plato, through fear of the adherents of polytheism, introduces his “maker” uttering words
which contradict himself. For having formerly stated that he said that everything which is
produced is perishable, he now introduces him saying the very opposite; and he does not
see that it is thus absolutely impossible for him to escape the charge of falsehood. For he
either at first uttered what is false when he said that everything which is produced is perishable,
or now, when he propounds the very opposite to what he had formerly said. For if,
according to his former definition, it is absolutely necessary that every created thing be
perishable, how can he consistently make that possible which is absolutely impossible? So
that Plato seems to grant an empty and impossible prerogative to his “maker,” when he
propounds that those who were once perishable because made from matter should again,
by his intervention, become imperishable and enduring. For it is quite natural that the power
of matter, which, according to Plato’s opinion, is uncreated, and contemporary and coæval
with the maker, should resist his will. For he who has not created has no power, in respect
of that which is uncreated, so that it is not possible that it (matter), being free, can be controlled
by any external necessity. Wherefore Plato himself, in consideration of this, has
written thus: “It is necessary to affirm that God cannot suffer violence.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Agreement of Plato and Homer.</head>
<p>How, then, does Plato banish Homer from his republic, since, in the embassy to Achilles,
he represents Phoenix as saying to Achilles, “Even the gods themselves are not inflexible,”792
though Homer said this not of the king and Platonic maker of the gods, but of some of the
multitude whom the Greeks esteem as gods, as one can gather from Plato’s saying, “gods of
gods?” For Homer, by that golden chain,793 refers all power and might to the one highest
God. And the rest of the gods, he said, were so far distant from his divinity, that he thought
fit to name them even along with men. At least he introduces Ulysses saying of Hector to
Achilles, “He is raging terribly, trusting in Zeus, and values neither men nor gods.”794 In
this passage Homer seems to me without doubt to have learnt in Egypt, like Plato, concerning
the one God, and plainly and openly to declare this, that he who trusts in the really existent
God makes no account of those that do not exist. For thus the poet, in another passage, and
employing another but equivalent word, to wit, a pronoun, made use of the same participle
employed by Plato to designate the really existent God, concerning whom Plato said, “What
that is which always exists, and has no birth.” For not without a double sense does this expression
of Phoenix seem to have been used: “Not even if God Himself were to promise me,
that, having burnished off my old age, He should set me forth in the flower of youth.” For
the pronoun “Himself” signifies the really existing God. For thus, too, the oracle which was
given to you concerning the Chaldæans and Hebrews signifies. For when some one inquired
what men had ever lived godly, you say the answer was:—
<lg>
<l>“Only the Chaldæans and the Hebrews found wisdom,</l>
<l>Worshipping God Himself, the unbegotten King.”</l>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Plato’s knowledge of God’s eternity.</head>
<p>How, then, does Plato blame Homer for saying that the gods are not inflexible, although,
as is obvious from the expressions used, Homer said this for a useful purpose? For it is the
property of those who expect to obtain mercy by prayer and sacrifices, to cease from and
repent of their sins. For those who think that the Deity is inflexible, are by no means moved
to abandon their sins, since they suppose that they will derive no benefit from repentance.
How, then, does Plato the philosopher condemn the poet Homer for saying, “Even the gods
themselves are not inflexible,” and yet himself represent the maker of the gods as so easily
turned, that he sometimes declares the gods to be mortal, and at other times declares the
same to be immortal? And not only concerning them, but also concerning matter, from
which, as he says, it is necessary that the created gods have been produced, he sometimes
says that it is uncreated, and at other times that it is created; and yet he does not see that he
himself, when he says that the maker of the gods is so easily turned, is convicted of having
fallen into the very errors for which he blames Homer, though Homer said the very opposite
concerning the maker of the gods. For he said that he spoke thus of himself:—
<lg>
<l>“For ne’er my promise shall deceive, or fail,</l>
<l>Or be recall’d, if with a nod confirm’d.”795</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But Plato, as it seems, unwillingly entered not these strange dissertations concerning
the gods, for he feared those who were attached to polytheism. And whatever he thinks fit
to tell of all that he had learned from Moses and the prophets concerning one God, he preferred
delivering in a mystical style, so that those who desired to be worshippers of God
might have an inkling of his own opinion. For being charmed with that saying of God to
Moses, “I am the really existing,” and accepting with a great deal of thought the brief participial
expression, he understood that God desired to signify to Moses His eternity, and
therefore said, “I am the really existing;” for this word “existing” expresses not one time
only, but the three—the past, the present, and the future. For when Plato says, “and which
never really is,” he uses the verb “is” of time indefinite. For the word “never” is not spoken,
as some suppose, of the past, but of the future time. And this has been accurately understood
even by profane writers. And therefore, when Plato wished, as it were, to interpret to the
uninitiated what had been mystically expressed by the participle concerning the eternity of
God, he employed the following language: “God indeed, as the old tradition runs, includes
the beginning, and end, and middle of all things.” In this sentence he plainly and obviously
names the law of Moses “the old tradition,” fearing, through dread of the hemlock-cup, to
mention the name of Moses; for he understood that the teaching of the man was hateful to
the Greeks; and he clearly enough indicates Moses by the antiquity of the tradition. And we
<note type="footnote">795 Iliad, i. 526.</note>

<pb n="758"/>
have sufficiently proved from Diodorus and the rest of the historians, in the foregoing
chapters, that the law of Moses is not only old, but even the first. For Diodorus says that he
was the first of all lawgivers; the letters which belong to the Greeks, and which they employed
in the writing of their histories, having not yet been discovered.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Plato indebted to the prophets.</head>
<p>And let no one wonder that Plato should believe Moses regarding the eternity of God.
For you will find him mystically referring the true knowledge of realities to the prophets,
next in order after the really existent God. For, discoursing in the Timæus about certain
first principles, he wrote thus: “This we lay down as the first principle of fire and the other
bodies, proceeding according to probability and necessity. But the first principles of these
again God above knows, and whosoever among men is beloved of Him.”796 And what men
does he think beloved of God, but Moses and the rest of the prophets? For their prophecies
he read, and, having learned from them the doctrine of the judgment, he thus proclaims it
in the first book of the Republic: “When a man begins to think he is soon to die, fear invades
him, and concern about things which had never before entered his head. And those stories
about what goes on in Hades, which tell us that the man who has here been unjust must
there be punished, though formerly ridiculed, now torment his soul with apprehensions
that they may be true. And he, either through the feebleness of age, or even because he is
now nearer to the things of the other world, views them more attentively. He becomes,
therefore, full of apprehension and dread, and begins to call himself to account, and to
consider whether he has done any one an injury. And that man who finds in his life many
iniquities, and who continually starts from his sleep as children do, lives in terror, and with
a forlorn prospect. But to him who is conscious of no wrong-doing, sweet hope is the constant
companion and good nurse of old age, as Pindar says.797 For this, Socrates, he has elegantly
expressed, that ‘whoever leads a life of holiness and justice, him sweet hope, the nurse of
age, accompanies, cheering his heart, for she powerfully sways the changeful mind of mortals.’

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Plato’s knowledge of the judgment.</head>
<p>And in the tenth book he plainly and manifestly wrote what he had learned from the
prophets about the judgment, not as if he had learned it from them, but, on account of his
fear of the Greeks, as if he had heard it from a man who had been slain in battle—for this
story he thought fit to invent—and who, when he was about to be buried on the twelfth day,
and was lying on the funeral pile, came to life again, and described the other world. The
following are his very words:799 “For he said that he was present when one was asked by
another person where the great Ardiæus was. This Ardiæus had been prince in a certain
city of Pamphylia, and had killed his aged father and his elder brother, and done many
other unhallowed deeds, as was reported. He said, then, that the person who was asked said:
He neither comes nor ever will come hither. For we saw, among other terrible sights, this
also. When we were close to the mouth [of the pit], and were about to return to the upper
air, and had suffered everything else, we suddenly beheld both him and others likewise,
most of whom were tyrants. But there were also some private sinners who had committed
great crimes. And these, when they thought they were to ascend, the mouth would not
permit, but bellowed when any of those who were so incurably wicked attempted to ascend,
unless they had paid the full penalty. Then fierce men, fiery to look at, stood close by, and
hearing the din,800 took some and led them away; but Ardiæus and the rest, having bound
hand and foot, and striking their heads down, and flaying, they dragged to the road outside,
tearing them with thorns, and signifying to those who were present the cause of their suffering
these things, and that they were leading them away to cast them into Tartarus. Hence, he
said, that amidst all their various fears, this one was the greatest, lest the mouth should bellow
when they ascended, since if it were silent each one would most gladly ascend; and that the
punishments and torments were such as these, and that, on the other hand, the rewards
were the reverse of these.” Here Plato seems to me to have learnt from the prophets not only
the doctrine of the judgment, but also of the resurrection, which the Greeks refuse to believe.
For his saying that the soul is judged along with the body, proves nothing more clearly than
that he believed the doctrine of the resurrection. Since how could Ardiæus and the rest have
undergone such punishment in Hades, had they left on earth the body, with its head, hands,
feet, and skin? For certainly they will never say that the soul has a head and hands, and feet
and skin. But Plato, having fallen in with the testimonies of the prophets in Egypt, and
having accepted what they teach concerning the resurrection of the body, teaches that the
soul is judged in company with the body.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Homer’s obligations to the sacred writers.</head>
<p>And not only Plato, but Homer also, having received similar enlightenment in Egypt,
said that Tityus was in like manner punished. For Ulysses speaks thus to Alcinous when he
is recounting his divination by the shades of the dead:801—
<lg>
<l>“There Tityus, large and long, in fetters bound,</l>
<l>O’erspread nine acres of infernal ground;</l>
<l>Two ravenous vultures, furious for their food,</l>
<l>Scream o’er the fiend, and riot in his blood,</l>
<l>Incessant gore the liver in his breast,</l>
<l>Th’ immortal liver grows, and gives th’ immortal feast.”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>For it is plain that it is not the soul, but the body, which has a liver. And in the same
manner he has described both Sisyphus and Tantalus as enduring punishment with the
body. And that Homer had been in Egypt, and introduced into his own poem much of what
he there learnt, Diodorus, the most esteemed of historians, plainly enough teaches us. For
he said that when he was in Egypt he had learnt that Helen, having received from Theon’s
wife, Polydamna, a drug, “lulling all sorrow and melancholy, and causing forgetfulness of
all ills,”802 brought it to Sparta. And Homer said that by making use of that drug Helen put
an end to the lamentation of Menelaus, caused by the presence of Telemachus. And he also
called Venus “golden,” from what he had seen in Egypt. For he had seen the temple which
in Egypt is called “the temple of golden Venus,” and the plain which is named “the plain of
golden Venus.” And why do I now make mention of this? To show that the poet transferred
to his own poem much of what is contained in the divine writings of the prophets. And first
he transferred what Moses had related as the beginning of the creation of the world. For
Moses wrote thus: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,”803 then the
sun, and the moon, and the stars. For having learned this in Egypt, and having been much
taken with what Moses had written in the Genesis of the world, he fabled that Vulcan had
made in the shield of Achilles a kind of representation of the creation of the world. For he
wrote thus:804—
<lg>
<l>“There he described the earth, the heaven, the sea,</l>
<l>The sun that rests not, and the moon full-orb’d;</l>
<l>There also, all the stars which round about,</l></lg>

<pb n="762"/>
<lg>
<l>As with a radiant frontlet, bind the skies.</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>And he contrived also that the garden of Alcinous should preserve the likeness of
Paradise, and through this likeness he represented it as ever-blooming and full of all fruits.
For thus he wrote:805—
<lg>
<l>“Tall thriving trees confess’d the fruitful mould;</l>
<l>The reddening apple ripens here to gold.</l>
<l>Here the blue fig with luscious juice o’erflows,</l>
<l>With deeper red the full pomegranate glows;</l>
<l>The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear,</l>
<l>And verdant olives flourish round the year.</l>
<l>The balmy spirit of the western gale</l>
<l>Eternal breathes on fruits, untaught to fail;</l>
<l>Each dropping pear a following pear supplies,</l>
<l>On apples apples, figs on figs arise.</l>
<l>The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,</l>
<l>The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.</l>
<l>Here order’d vines in equal ranks appear,</l>
<l>With all th’ united labours of the year.</l>
<l>Some to unload the fertile branches run,</l>
<l>Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun,</l>
<l>Here are the vines in early flower descry’d</l>
<l>Others to tread the liquid harvest join.</l>
<l>The groaning presses foam with floods of wine.</l>
<l>Here grapes discoloured on the sunny side,</l>
<l>And there in autumn’s richest purple dy’d.”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>Do not these words present a manifest and clear imitation of what the first prophet
Moses said about Paradise? And if any one wish to know something of the building of the
tower by which the men of that day fancied they would obtain access to heaven, he will find
a sufficiently exact allegorical imitation of this in what the poet has ascribed to Otus and
Ephialtes. For of them he wrote thus:806—
<lg>
<l>“Proud of their strength, and more than mortal size,</l>
<l>The gods they challenge, and affect the skies.</l></lg>

<p>And the same holds good regarding the enemy of mankind who was cast out of heaven,
whom the Sacred Scriptures call the Devil,807 a name which he obtained from his first devilry
against man; and if any one would attentively consider the matter, he would find that the
poet, though he certainly never mentions the name of “the devil,” yet gives him a name from
his wickedest action. For the poet, calling him Ate,808 says that he was hurled from heaven
by their god, just as if he had a distinct remembrance of the expressions which Isaiah the
prophet had uttered regarding him. He wrote thus in his own poem:809—
<lg>
<l>“And, seizing by her glossy locks</l>
<l>The goddess Ate, in his wrath he swore</l>
<l>That never to the starry skies again,</l>
<l>And the Olympian heights, he would permit</l>
<l>The universal mischief to return.</l>
<l>Then, whirling her around, he cast her down</l>
<l>To earth. She, mingling with all works of men,</l>
<l>Caused many a pang to Jove.</l>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Origin of Plato’s doctrine of form.</head>
<p>And Plato, too, when he says that form is the third original principle next to God and
matter, has manifestly received this suggestion from no other source than from Moses,
having learned, indeed, from the words of Moses the name of form, but not having at the
same time been instructed by the initiated, that without mystic insight it is impossible to
have any distinct knowledge of the writings of Moses. For Moses wrote that God had spoken
to him regarding the tabernacle in the following words: “And thou shalt make for me according
to all that I show thee in the mount, the pattern of the tabernacle.”810 And again:
“And thou shalt erect the tabernacle according to the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
even so shalt thou make it.”811 And again, a little afterwards: “Thus then thou shalt make
it according to the pattern which was showed to thee in the mount.”812 Plato, then, reading
these passages, and not receiving what was written with the suitable insight, thought that
form had some kind of separate existence before that which the senses perceive, and he often
calls it the pattern of the things which are made, since the writing of Moses spoke thus of
the tabernacle: “According to the form showed to thee in the mount, so shalt thou make it.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Homer’s knowledge of man’s origin.</head>
<p>And he was obviously deceived in the same way regarding the earth and heaven and
man; for he supposes that there are “ideas” of these. For as Moses wrote thus, “In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth,” and then subjoins this sentence, “And the earth
was invisible and unfashioned,” he thought that it was the pre-existent earth which was
spoken of in the words, “The earth was,” because Moses said, “And the earth was invisible
and unfashioned;” and he thought that the earth, concerning which he says, “God created
the heaven and the earth,” was that earth which we perceive by the senses, and which God
made according to the pre-existent form. And so also, of the heaven which was created, he
thought that the heaven which was created—and which he also called the firmament—was
that creation which the senses perceive; and that the heaven which the intellect perceives is
that other of which the prophet said, “The heaven of heavens is the Lord’s, but the earth
hath He given to the children of men.”813 And so also concerning man: Moses first mentions
the name of man, and then after many other creations he makes mention of the formation
of man, saying, “And God made man, taking dust from the earth.”814 He thought, accordingly,
that the man first so named existed before the man who was made, and that he who
was formed of the earth was afterwards made according to the pre-existent form. And that
man was formed of earth, Homer, too, having discovered from the ancient and divine history
which says, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,”815 calls the lifeless body of
Hector dumb clay. For in condemnation of Achilles dragging the corpse of Hector after
death, he says somewhere:816—
<lg>
<l>“On the dumb clay he cast indignity,</l>
<l>Blinded with rage.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And again, somewhere else,817 he introduces Menelaus, thus addressing those who were
not accepting Hector’s challenge to single combat with becoming alacrity,—
<lg>
<l>“To earth and water may you all return,”—</l>
</lg>
resolving them in his violent rage into their original and pristine formation from earth.
These things Homer and Plato, having learned in Egypt from the ancient histories, wrote
in their own words.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Further proof of Plato’s acquaintance with Scripture.</head>
<p>For from what other source, if not from his reading the writings of the prophets, could
Plato have derived the information he gives us, that Jupiter drives a winged chariot in
heaven? For he knew this from the following expressions of the prophet about the cherubim:
“And the glory of the Lord went out from the house and rested on the cherubim; and the
cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the Lord God of
Israel was over them above.”818 And borrowing this idea, the magniloquent Plato shouts
aloud with vast assurance, “The great Jove, indeed, driving his winged chariot in heaven.”
For from what other source, if not from Moses and the prophets, did he learn this and so
write? And whence did he receive the suggestion of his saying that God exists in a fiery
substance? Was it not from the third book of the history of the Kings, where it is written,
“The Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in
the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after
the fire a still small voice?”819 But these things pious men must understand in a higher sense
with profound and meditative insight. But Plato, not attending to the words with the suitable
insight, said that God exists in a fiery substance.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Plato’s doctrine of the heavenly gift.</head>
<p>And if any one will attentively consider the gift that descends from God on the holy
men, —which gift the sacred prophets call the Holy Ghost,—he shall find that this was announced
under another name by Plato in the dialogue with Meno. For, fearing to name the
gift of God “the Holy Ghost,” lest he should seem, by following the teaching of the prophets,
to be an enemy to the Greeks, he acknowledges, indeed, that it comes down from God, yet
does not think fit to name it the Holy Ghost, but virtue. For so in the dialogue with Meno,
concerning reminiscence, after he had put many questions regarding virtue, whether it could
be taught or whether it could not be taught, but must be gained by practice, or whether it
could be attained neither by practice nor by learning, but was a natural gift in men, or
whether it comes in some other way, he makes this declaration in these very words: “But if
now through this whole dialogue we have conducted our inquiry and discussion aright,
virtue must be neither a natural gift, nor what one can receive by teaching, but comes to
those to whom it does come by divine destiny.” These things, I think, Plato having learned
from the prophets regarding the Holy Ghost, he has manifestly transferred to what he calls
virtue. For as the sacred prophets say that one and the same spirit is divided into seven
spirits, so he also, naming it one and the same virtue, says this is divided into four virtues;
wishing by all means to avoid mention of the Holy Spirit, but clearly declaring in a kind of
allegory what the prophets said of the Holy Spirit. For to this effect he spoke in the dialogue
with Meno towards the close: “From this reasoning, Meno, it appears that virtue comes to
those to whom it does come by a divine destiny. But we shall know clearly about this, in
what kind of way virtue comes to men, when, as a first step, we shall have set ourselves to
investigate, as an independent inquiry, what virtue itself is.” You see how he calls only by
the name of virtue, the gift that descends from above; and yet he counts it worthy of inquiry,
whether it is right that this [gift] be called virtue or some other thing, fearing to name it
openly the Holy Spirit, lest he should seem to be following the teaching of the prophets.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Plato’s idea of the beginning of time drawn from Moses.</head>
<p>And from what source did Plato draw the information that time was created along with
the heavens? For he wrote thus: “Time, accordingly, was created along with the heavens; in
order that, coming into being together, they might also be together dissolved, if ever their
dissolution should take place.” Had he not learned this from the divine history of Moses?
For he knew that the creation of time had received its original constitution from days and
months and years. Since, then, the first day which was created along with the heavens constituted
the beginning of all time (for thus Moses wrote, “In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth,” and then immediately subjoins, “And one day was made,” as if he
would designate the whole of time by one part of it), Plato names the day “time,” lest, if he
mentioned the “day,” he should seem to lay himself open to the accusation of the Athenians,
that he was completely adopting the expressions of Moses. And from what source did he
derive what he has written regarding the dissolution of the heavens? Had he not learned
this, too, from the sacred prophets, and did he not think that this was their doctrine?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Whence men attributed to God human form.</head>
<p>And if any person investigates the subject of images, and inquires on what ground those
who first fashioned your gods conceived that they had the forms of men, he will find that
this also was derived from the divine history. For seeing that Moses's history, speaking in
the person of God, says, “Let Us make man in our image and likeness,” these persons, under
the impression that this meant that men were like God in form, began thus to fashion their
gods, supposing they would make a likeness from a likeness. But why, ye men of Greece,
am I now induced to recount these things? That ye may know that it is not possible to learn
the true religion from those who were unable, even on those subjects by which they won
the admiration of the heathen,820 to write anything original, but merely propounded by
some allegorical device in their own writings what they had learned from Moses and the

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Appeal to the Greeks.</head>
<p>The time, then, ye men of Greece, is now come, that ye, having been persuaded by the
secular histories that Moses and the rest of the prophets were far more ancient than any of
those who have been esteemed sages among you, abandon the ancient delusion of your
forefathers, and read the divine histories of the prophets, and ascertain from them the true
religion; for they do not present to you artful discourses, nor speak speciously and plausibly—
for this is the property of those who wish to rob you of the truth—but use with simplicity
the words and expressions which offer themselves, and declare to you whatever the
Holy Ghost, who descended upon them, chose to teach through them to those who are desirous
to learn the true religion. Having then laid aside all false shame, and the inveterate
error of mankind, with all its bombastic parade and empty noise, though by means of it you
fancy you are possessed of all advantages, do you give yourselves to the things that profit
you. For neither will you commit any offence against your fathers, if you now show a desire
to betake yourselves to that which is quite opposed to their error, since it is likely enough
that they themselves are now lamenting in Hades, and repenting with a too late repentance;
and if it were possible for them to show you thence what had befallen them after the termination
of this life, ye would know from what fearful ills they desired to deliver you. But now,
since it is not possible in this present life that ye either learn from them, or from those who
here profess to teach that philosophy which is falsely so called, it follows as the one thing
that remains for you to do, that, renouncing the error of your fathers, ye read the prophecies
of the sacred writers,821 not requiring from them unexceptionable diction (for the matters
of our religion lie in works,822 not in words), and learn from them what will give you life
everlasting. For those who bootlessly disgrace the name of philosophy are convicted of
knowing nothing at all, as they are themselves forced, though unwillingly, to confess, since
not only do they disagree with each other, but also expressed their own opinions sometimes
in one way, sometimes in another.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—True knowledge not held by the philosophers.</head>
<p>And if “the discovery of the truth” be given among them as one definition of philosophy,
how are they who are not in possession of the true knowledge worthy of the name of
philosophy? For if Socrates, the wisest of your wise men, to whom even your oracle, as you
yourselves say, bears witness, saying, “Of all men Socrates is the wisest”—if he confesses
that he knows nothing, how did those who came after him profess to know even things
heavenly? For Socrates said that he was on this account called wise, because, while other
men pretended to know what they were ignorant of, he himself did not shrink from confessing
that he knew nothing. For he said, “I seem to myself to be wisest by this little particular,
that what I do not know, I do not suppose I know.” Let no one fancy that Socrates ironically
feigned ignorance, because he often used to do so in his dialogues. For the last expression
of his apology which he uttered as he was being led away to the prison, proves that in seriousness
and truth he was confessing his ignorance: “But now it is time to go away, I indeed
to die, but you to live. And which of us goes to the better state, is hidden to all but God.”
Socrates, indeed, having uttered this last sentence in the Areopagus, departed to the prison,
ascribing to God alone the knowledge of those things which are hidden from us; but those
who came after him, though they are unable to comprehend even earthly things, profess to
understand things heavenly as if they had seen them. Aristotle at least—as if he had seen
things heavenly with greater accuracy than Plato—declared that God did not exist, as Plato
said, in the fiery substance (for this was Plato’s doctrine) but in the fifth element, air. And
while he demanded that concerning these matters he should be believed on account of the
excellence of his language, he yet departed this life because he was overwhelmed with the
infamy and disgrace of being unable to discover even the nature of the Euripus in Chalcis.823
Let not any one, therefore, of sound judgment prefer the elegant diction of these men to his
own salvation, but let him, according to that old story, stop his ears with wax, and flee the
sweet hurt which these sirens would inflict upon him. For the above-mentioned men,
presenting their elegant language as a kind of bait, have sought to seduce many from the
right religion, in imitation of him who dared to teach the first men polytheism. Be not persuaded
by these persons, I entreat you, but read the prophecies of the sacred writers.824 And
if any slothfulness or old hereditary superstition prevents you from reading the prophecies
of the holy men through which you can be instructed regarding the one only God, which
is the first article of the true religion, yet believe him who, though at first he taught you
polytheism, yet afterwards preferred to sing a useful and necessary recantation—I mean
Orpheus, who said what I quoted a little before; and believe the others who wrote the same
things concerning one God. For it was the work of Divine Providence on your behalf, that

was true, in order that, the doctrine of a plurality of gods being rejected by all, occasion
might be afforded you of knowing the truth.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—Of the Sibyl.825</head>
<p>And you may in part easily learn the right religion from the ancient Sibyl, who by some
kind of potent inspiration teaches you, through her oracular predictions, truths which seem
to be much akin to the teaching of the prophets. She, they say, was of Babylonian extraction,
being the daughter of Berosus, who wrote the Chaldæan History; and when she had crossed
over (how, I know not) into the region of Campania, she there uttered her oracular sayings
in a city called Cumæ, six miles from Baiæ, where the hot springs of Campania are found.
And being in that city, we saw also a certain place, in which we were shown a very large
basilica826 cut out of one stone; a vast affair, and worthy of all admiration. And they who
had heard it from their fathers as part of their country’s tradition, told us that it was here
she used to publish her oracles. And in the middle of the basilica they showed us three receptacles
cut out of one stone, in which, when filled with water, they said that she washed,
and having put on her robe again, retires into the inmost chamber of the basilica, which is
still a part of the one stone; and sitting in the middle of the chamber on a high rostrum and
throne, thus proclaims her oracles. And both by many other writers has the Sibyl been
mentioned as a prophetess, and also by Plato in his Phædrus. And Plato seems to me to have
counted prophets divinely inspired when he read her prophecies. For he saw that what she
had long ago predicted was accomplished; and on this account he expresses in the Dialogue
with Meno his wonder at and admiration of prophets in the following terms: “Those whom
we now call prophetic persons we should rightly name divine. And not least would we say
that they are divine, and are raised to the prophetic ecstasy by the inspiration and possession
of God, when they correctly speak of many and important matters, and yet know nothing
of what they are saying,” —plainly and manifestly referring to the prophecies of the Sibyl.
For, unlike the poets who, after their poems are penned, have power to correct and polish,
specially in the way of increasing the accuracy of their verse, she was filled indeed with
prophecy at the time of the inspiration, but as soon as the inspiration ceased, there ceased
also the remembrance of all she had said. And this indeed was the cause why some only,
and not all, the metres of the verses of the Sibyl were preserved. For we ourselves, when in
that city, ascertained from our cicerone, who showed us the places in which she used to
prophesy, that there was a certain coffer made of brass in which they said that her remains
were preserved. And besides all else which they told us as they had heard it from their fathers,
they said also that they who then took down her prophecies, being illiterate persons, often
went quite astray from the accuracy of the metres; and this, they said, was the cause of the
want of metre in some of the verses, the prophetess having no remembrance of what she

<pb n="774"/>
had said, after the possession and inspiration ceased, and the reporters having, through their
lack of education, failed to record the metres with accuracy. And on this account, it is
manifest that Plato had an eye to the prophecies of the Sibyl when he said this about
prophets, for he said, “When they correctly speak of many and important matters, and yet
know nothing of what they are saying.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—Concluding appeal.</head>
<p>But since, ye men of Greece, the matters of the true religion lie not in the metrical
numbers of poetry, nor yet in that culture which is highly esteemed among you, do ye
henceforward pay less devotion to accuracy of metres and of language; and giving heed
without contentiousness to the words of the Sibyl, recognise how great are the benefits which
she will confer upon you by predicting, as she does in a clear and patent manner, the advent
of our Saviour Jesus Christ;827 who, being the Word of God, inseparable from Him in power,
having assumed man, who had been made in the image and likeness of God, restored to us
the knowledge of the religion of our ancient forefathers, which the men who lived after them
abandoned through the bewitching counsel of the envious devil, and turned to the worship
of those who were no gods. And if you still hesitate and are hindered from belief regarding
the formation of man, believe those whom you have hitherto thought it right to give heed
to, and know that your own oracle, when asked by some one to utter a hymn of praise to
the Almighty God, in the middle of the hymn spoke thus, “Who formed the first of men,
and called him Adam.” And this hymn is preserved by many whom we know, for the conviction
of those who are unwilling to believe the truth which all bear witness to. If therefore,
ye men of Greece, ye do not esteem the false fancy concerning those that are no gods at a
higher rate than your own salvation, believe, as I said, the most ancient and time-honoured
Sibyl, whose books are preserved in all the world, and who by some kind of potent inspiration
both teaches us in her oracular utterances concerning those that are called gods, that have
no existence; and also clearly and manifestly prophesies concerning the predicted advent
of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and concerning all those things which were to be done by Him.
For the knowledge of these things will constitute your necessary preparatory training for
the study of the prophecies of the sacred writers. And if any one supposes that he has learned
the doctrine concerning God from the most ancient of those whom you name philosophers,
let him listen to Ammon and Hermes:828 to Ammon, who in his discourse concerning God
calls Him wholly hidden; and to Hermes, who says plainly and distinctly, “that it is difficult
to comprehend God, and that it is impossible even for the man who can comprehend Him
to declare Him to others.” From every point of view, therefore, it must be seen that in no
other way than only from the prophets who teach us by divine inspiration, is it at all possible
to learn anything concerning God and the true religion.829</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Object of the author.</head>
<p>Although human nature at first received a union of intelligence and safety to discern
the truth, and the worship due to the one Lord of all, yet envy, insinuating the excellence
of human greatness, turned men away to the making of idols; and this superstitious custom,
after continuing for a long period, is handed down to the majority as if it were natural and
true. It is the part of a lover of man, or rather of a lover of God, to remind men who have
neglected it of that which they ought to know. For the truth is of itself sufficient to show
forth, by means of those things which are contained under the pole of heaven, the order
[instituted by] Him who has created them. But forgetfulness having taken possession of the
minds of men, through the long-suffering of God, has acted recklessly in transferring to
mortals the name which is applicable to the only true God; and from the few the infection
of sin spread to the many, who were blinded by popular usage to the knowledge of that
which was lasting and unchangeable. For the men of former generations, who instituted
private and public rites in honour of such as were more powerful, caused forgetfulness of
the Catholic831 faith to take possession of their posterity; but I, as I have just stated, along
with a God-loving mind, shall employ the speech of one who loves man, and set it before
those who have intelligence, which all ought to have who are privileged to observe the administration
of the universe, so that they should worship unchangeably Him who knows
all things. This I shall do, not by mere display of words, but by altogether using demonstration
drawn from the old poetry in Greek literature,832 and from writings very common amongst
all. For from these the famous men who have handed down idol-worship as law to the
multitudes, shall be taught and convicted by their own poets and literature of great ignorance.</p>

<p>First, then, Æschylus,833 in expounding the arrangement of his work,834 expressed
himself also as follows respecting the only God:—
<lg>
<l>“Afar from mortals place the holy God,</l>
<l>Nor ever think that He, like to thyself,</l>
<l>In fleshly robes is clad; for all unknown</l>
<l>Is the great God to such a worm as thou.</l>
<l>Divers similitudes He bears; at times</l>
<l>He seems as a consuming fire that burns</l>
<l>Unsated; now like water, then again</l>
<l>In sable folds of darkness shrouds Himself.</l>
<l>Nay, even the very beasts of earth reflect</l>
<l>His sacred image; whilst the wind, clouds, rain,</l>
<l>The roll of thunder and the lightning flash,</l>
<l>Reveal to men their great and sovereign Lord.</l>
<l>Before Him sea and rocks, with every fount,</l>
<l>And all the water floods, in reverence bend;</l>
<l>And as they gaze upon His awful face,</l>
<l>Mountains and earth, with the profoundest depths</l>
<l>Of ocean, and the highest peaks of hills,</l>
<l>Tremble: for He is Lord Omnipotent;</l>
<l>And this the glory is of God Most High."</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But he was not the only man initiated in the knowledge of God; for Sophocles also thus
describes the nature of the only Creator of all things, the One God:—
<lg>
<l>“There is one God, in truth there is but one,</l>
<l>Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,</l>
<l>The glancing waves of ocean, and the winds;</l>
<l>But many of us mortals err in heart,</l>
<l>And set up, for a solace in our woes,</l>
<l>Images of the gods in stone and brass,</l>
<l>Or figures carved in gold or ivory;</l>

<head>Chapter V.—The vain pretensions of false gods.</head>
<p>But concerning those who think that they shall share the holy and perfect name, which
some have received by a vain tradition as if they were gods, Menander in the Auriga says:—
<lg>
<l>“If there exists a god who walketh out</l>
<l>With an old woman, or who enters in</l>
<l>By stealth to houses through the folding-doors,</l>
<l>He ne’er can please me; nay, but only he</l>
<l>Who stays at home, a just and righteous God,</l>
<l>To give salvation to His worshippers.”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>The same Menander, in the Sacerdos, says:—
<lg>
<l>“There is no God, O woman, that can save</l>
<l>One man by another; if indeed a man,</l>
<l>With sound of tinkling cymbals, charm a god</l>
<l>Where’er he listeth, then assuredly</l>
<l>He who doth so is much the greater god.</l>
<l>But these, O Rhode, are but the cunning schemes</l>
<l>Which daring men of intrigue, unabashed,</l>
<l>Invent to earn themselves a livelihood,</l>
<l>And yield a laughing-stock unto the age."</l>
</lg>
</p> 
<p>Again, the same Menander, stating his opinion about those who are received as gods,
proving rather that they are not so, says:—
<lg>
<l>“Yea, if I this beheld, I then should wish</l>
<l>That back to me again my soul returned.</l>
<l>For tell me where, O Getas, in the world</l>
<l>’Tis possible to find out righteous gods?”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>And in the Depositum:—
<lg>
<l>“There’s an unrighteous judgment, as it seems,</l>
<l>Even with the gods.”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>And Euripides the tragedian, in Orestes, says:—
<lg>
<l>“Apollo having caused by his command</l>
<l>The murder of the mother, knoweth not</l>
<l>What honesty and justice signify.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>We serve the gods, whoever they may be;</l>
<l>But from the central regions of the earth</l>

<l>I him obeyed, when she that bore me fell</l>
<l>Slain by my hand: he is the wicked man.</l>
<l>Then slay him, for ’twas he that sinned, not I.</l>
<l>What could I do? Think you not that the god</l>
<l>Should free me from the blame which I do bear?”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>The same also in Hippolytus:—
<lg>
<l>“But on these points the gods do not judge right.”</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>And in Ion:—
<lg>
<l>“But in the daughter of Erechtheus</l>
<l>What interest have I? for that pertains</l>
<l>Not unto such as me. But when I come</l>
<l>With golden vessels for libations, I</l>
<l>The dew shall sprinkle, and yet needs must warn</l>
<l>Apollo of his deeds; for when he weds</l>
<l>Maidens by force, the children secretly</l>
<l>Begotten he betrays, and then neglects</l>
<l>When dying. Thus not you; but while you may</l>

<p>Here, then, is a proof of virtue, and of a mind loving prudence, to recur to the communion
of the unity,847 and to attach one’s self to prudence for salvation, and make choice of
the better things according to the free-will placed in man; and not to think that those who
are possessed of human passions are lords of all, when they shall not appear to have even
equal power with men. For in Homer,848 Demodocus says he is self-taught —
<lg>
<l>“God inspired me with strains”—</l>

<p>though he is a mortal. Æsculapius and Apollo are taught to heal by Chiron the Centaur,—
a very novel thing indeed, for gods to be taught by a man. What need I speak of
Bacchus, who the poet says is mad? or of Hercules, who he says is unhappy? What need to
speak of Mars and Venus, the leaders of adultery; and by means of all these to establish the
proof which has been undertaken? For if some one, in ignorance, should imitate the deeds
which are said to be divine, he would be reckoned among impure men, and a stranger to
life and humanity; and if any one does so knowingly, he will have a plausible excuse for escaping
vengeance, by showing that imitation of godlike deeds of audacity is no sin. But if
any one should blame these deeds, he will take away their well-known names, and not cover
them up with specious and plausible words. It is necessary, then, to accept the true and invariable
Name, not proclaimed by my words only, but by the words of those who have introduced
us to the elements of learning, in order that we may not, by living idly in this
present state of existence, not only as those who are ignorant of the heavenly glory, but also
as having proved ourselves ungrateful, render our account to the Judge.849</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The self-evidencing power of truth.</head>
<p>The word of truth is free, and carries its own authority, disdaining to fall under any
skilful argument, or to endure the logical scrutiny of its hearers. But it would be believed
for its own nobility, and for the confidence due to Him who sends it. Now the word of truth
is sent from God; wherefore the freedom claimed by the truth is not arrogant. For being
sent with authority, it were not fit that it should be required to produce proof of what is
said; since neither is there any proof beyond itself, which is God. For every proof is more
powerful and trustworthy than that which it proves; since what is disbelieved, until proof
is produced, gets credit when such proof is produced, and is recognised as being what it was
stated to be. But nothing is either more powerful or more trustworthy than the truth; so
that he who requires proof of this is like one who wishes it demonstrated why the things
that appear to the senses do appear. For the test of those things which are received through
the reason, is sense; but of sense itself there is no test beyond itself. As then we bring those
things which reason hunts after, to sense, and by it judge what kind of things they are,
whether the things spoken be true or false, and then sit in judgment no longer, giving full
credit to its decision; so also we refer all that is said regarding men and the world to the
truth, and by it judge whether it be worthless or no. But the utterances of truth we judge by
no separate test, giving full credit to itself. And God, the Father of the universe, who is the
perfect intelligence, is the truth. And the Word, being His Son, came to us, having put on
flesh, revealing both Himself and the Father, giving to us in Himself resurrection from the
dead, and eternal life afterwards. And this is Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Lord. He, therefore,
is Himself both the faith and the proof of Himself and of all things. Wherefore those who
follow Him, and know Him, having faith in Him as their proof, shall rest in Him. But since
the adversary does not cease to resist many, and uses many and divers arts to ensnare them,
that he may seduce the faithful from their faith, and that he may prevent the faithless from
believing, it seems to me necessary that we also, being armed with the invulnerable doctrines
of the faith, do battle against him in behalf of the weak.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Objections to the resurrection of the flesh.</head>
<p>They who maintain the wrong opinion say that there is no resurrection of the flesh;
giving as their reason that it is impossible that what is corrupted and dissolved should be
restored to the same as it had been. And besides the impossibility, they say that the salvation
of the flesh is disadvantageous; and they abuse the flesh, adducing its infirmities, and declare
that it only is the cause of our sins, so that if the flesh, say they, rise again, our infirmities
also rise with it. And such sophistical reasons as the following they elaborate: If the flesh
rise again, it must rise either entire and possessed of all its parts, or imperfect. But its rising
imperfect argues a want of power on God’s part, if some parts could be saved, and others
not; but if all the parts are saved, then the body will manifestly have all its members. But is
it not absurd to say that these members will exist after the resurrection from the dead, since
the Saviour said, “They neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but shall be as the angels
in heaven?”850 And the angels, say they, have neither flesh, nor do they eat, nor have sexual
intercourse; therefore there shall be no resurrection of the flesh. By these and such like arguments,
they attempt to distract men from the faith. And there are some who maintain
that even Jesus Himself appeared only as spiritual, and not in flesh, but presented merely
the appearance of flesh: these persons seek to rob the flesh of the promise. First, then, let us
solve those things which seem to them to be insoluble; then we will introduce in an orderly
manner the demonstration concerning the flesh, proving that it partakes of salvation.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—If the members rise, must they discharge the same functions as
now?</head>
<p>They say, then, if the body shall rise entire, and in possession of all its members, it necessarily
follows that the functions of the members shall also be in existence; that the womb
shall become pregnant, and the male also discharge his function of generation, and the rest
of the members in like manner. Now let this argument stand or fall by this one assertion.
For this being proved false, their whole objection will be removed. Now it is indeed evident
that the members which discharge functions discharge those functions which in the present
life we see, but it does not follow that they necessarily discharge the same functions from
the beginning. And that this may be more clearly seen, let us consider it thus. The function
of the womb is to become pregnant; and of the member of the male to impregnate. But as,
though these members are destined to discharge such functions, it is not therefore necessary
that they from the beginning discharge them (since we see many women who do not become
pregnant, as those that are barren, even though they have wombs), so pregnancy is not the
immediate and necessary consequence of having a womb; but those even who are not barren
abstain from sexual intercourse, some being virgins from the first, and others from a certain
time. And we see men also keeping themselves virgins, some from the first, and some from
a certain time; so that by their means, marriage, made lawless through lust, is destroyed.851
And we find that some even of the lower animals, though possessed of wombs, do not bear,
such as the mule; and the male mules do not beget their kind. So that both in the case of
men and the irrational animals we can see sexual intercourse abolished; and this, too, before
the future world. And our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, for no other reason than
that He might destroy the begetting by lawless desire, and might show to the ruler852 that
the formation of man was possible to God without human intervention. And when He had
been born, and had submitted to the other conditions of the flesh,—I mean food, drink, and
clothing,—this one condition only of discharging the sexual function He did not submit to;
for, regarding the desires of the flesh, He accepted some as necessary, while others, which
were unnecessary, He did not submit to. For if the flesh were deprived of food, drink, and
clothing, it would be destroyed; but being deprived of lawless desire, it suffers no harm. And
at the same time He foretold that, in the future world, sexual intercourse should be done
away with; as He says, “The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; but the
children of the world to come neither marry nor are given in marriage, but shall be like the
angels in heaven.”853 Let not, then, those that are unbelieving marvel, if in the world to

<head>Chapter IV.—Must the deformed rise deformed?</head>
<p>Well, they say, if then the flesh rise, it must rise the same as it falls; so that if it die with
one eye, it must rise one-eyed; if lame, lame; if defective in any part of the body, in this part
the man must rise deficient. How truly blinded are they in the eyes of their hearts! For they
have not seen on the earth blind men seeing again, and the lame walking by His word. All
things which the Saviour did, He did in the first place in order that what was spoken concerning
Him in the prophets might be fulfilled, “that the blind should receive sight, and the
deaf hear,”854 and so on; but also to induce the belief that in the resurrection the flesh shall
rise entire. For if on earth He healed the sicknesses of the flesh, and made the body whole,
much more will He do this in the resurrection, so that the flesh shall rise perfect and entire.

<head>Chapter V.—The resurrection of the flesh is not impossible.</head>
<p>But again, of those who maintain that the flesh has no resurrection, some assert that it
is impossible; others that, considering how vile and despicable the flesh is, it is not fit that
God should raise it; and others, that it did not at the first receive the promise. First, then,
in respect of those who say that it is impossible for God to raise it, it seems to me that I
should show that they are ignorant, professing as they do in word that they are believers,
yet by their works proving themselves to be unbelieving, even more unbelieving than the
unbelievers. For, seeing that all the heathen believe in their idols, and are persuaded that to
them all things are possible (as even their poet Homer says,855 “The gods can do all things,
and that easily;” and he added the word “easily” that he might bring out the greatness of the
power of the gods), many do seem to be more unbelieving than they. For if the heathen believe
in their gods, which are idols (“which have ears, and they hear not; they have eyes, and they
see not”856), that they can do all things, though they be but devils, as saith the Scripture,
“The gods of the nations are devils,”857 much more ought we, who hold the right, excellent,
and true faith, to believe in our God, since also we have proofs [of His power], first in the
creation of the first man, for he was made from the earth by God; and this is sufficient
evidence of God’s power; and then they who observe things can see how men are generated
one by another, and can marvel in a still greater degree that from a little drop of moisture
so grand a living creature is formed. And certainly if this were only recorded in a promise,
and not seen accomplished, this too would be much more incredible than the other; but it
is rendered more credible by accomplishment.858 But even in the case of the resurrection
the Saviour has shown us accomplishments, of which we will in a little speak. But now we
are demonstrating that the resurrection of the flesh is possible, asking pardon of the children
of the Church if we adduce arguments which seem to be secular859 and physical:860 first,
because to God nothing is secular, not even the world itself, for it is His workmanship; and
secondly, because we are conducting our argument so as to meet unbelievers. For if we argued
with believers, it were enough to say that we believe; but now we must proceed by demonstrations.
The foregoing proofs are indeed quite sufficient to evince the possibility of the
resurrection of the flesh; but since these men are exceedingly unbelieving, we will further
adduce a more convincing argument still, —an argument drawn not from faith, for they are

not within its scope, but from their own mother unbelief,—I mean, of course, from physical
reasons. For if by such arguments we prove to them that the resurrection of the flesh is
possible, they are certainly worthy of great contempt if they can be persuaded neither by
the deliverances of faith nor by the arguments of the world.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The resurrection consistent with the opinions of the philosophers.</head>
<p>Those, then, who are called natural philosophers, say, some of them, as Plato, that the
universe is matter and God; others, as Epicurus, that it is atoms and the void;861 others, like
the Stoics, that it is these four—fire, water, air, earth. For it is sufficient to mention the most
prevalent opinions. And Plato says that all things are made from matter by God, and according
to His design; but Epicures and his followers say that all things are made from the atom
and the void by some kind of self-regulating action of the natural movement of the bodies;
and the Stoics, that all are made of the four elements, God pervading them. But while there
is such discrepancy among them, there are some doctrines acknowledged by them all in
common, one of which is that neither can anything be produced from what is not in being,
nor anything be destroyed or dissolved into what has not any being, and that the elements
exist indestructible out of which all things are generated. And this being so, the regeneration
of the flesh will, according to all these philosophers, appear to be possible. For if, according
to Plato, it is matter and God, both these are indestructible and God; and God indeed occupies
the position of an artificer, to wit, a potter; and matter occupies the place of clay or wax, or
some such thing. That, then, which is formed of matter, be it an image or a statue, is destructible;
but the matter itself is indestructible, such as clay or wax, or any other such kind of
matter. Thus the artist designs in the clay or wax, and makes the form of a living animal;
and again, if his handiwork be destroyed, it is not impossible for him to make the same
form, by working up the same material, and fashioning it anew. So that, according to Plato,
neither will it be impossible for God, who is Himself indestructible, and has also indestructible
material, even after that which has been first formed of it has been destroyed, to make it
anew again, and to make the same form just as it was before. But according to the Stoics
even, the body being produced by the mixture of the four elementary substances, when this
body has been dissolved into the four elements, these remaining indestructible, it is possible
that they receive a second time the same fusion and composition, from God pervading them,
and so re-make the body which they formerly made. Like as if a man shall make a composition
of gold and silver, and brass and tin, and then shall wish to dissolve it again, so that
each element exist separately, having again mixed them, he may, if he pleases, make the very
same composition as he had formerly made. Again, according to Epicurus, the atoms and
the void being indestructible, it is by a definite arrangement and adjustment of the atoms
as they come together, that both all other formations are produced, and the body itself; and
it being in course of time dissolved, is dissolved again into those atoms from which it was
also produced. And as these remain indestructible, it is not at all impossible, that by coming
together again, and receiving the same arrangement and position, they should make a body
of like nature to what was formerly produced by them; as if a jeweller should make in mosaic
<note type="footnote">861 τὸ κενόν, the void of space in which the infinity of atoms moved.</note>


<pb n="800"/>
the form of an animal, and the stones should be scattered by time or by the man himself
who made them, he having still in his possession the scattered stones, may gather them together
again, and having gathered, may dispose them in the same way, and make the same
form of an animal. And shall not God be able to collect again the decomposed members of
the flesh, and make the same body as was formerly produced by Him?</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The body valuable in God’s sight.</head>
<p>But the proof of the possibility of the resurrection of the flesh I have sufficiently
demonstrated, in answer to men of the world. And if the resurrection of the flesh is not
found impossible on the principles even of unbelievers, how much more will it be found in
accordance with the mind of believers! But following our order, we must now speak with
respect to those who think meanly of the flesh, and say that it is not worthy of the resurrection
nor of the heavenly economy,862 because, first, its substance is earth; and besides, because
it is full of all wickedness, so that it forces the soul to sin along with it. But these persons
seem to be ignorant of the whole work of God, both of the genesis and formation of man
at the first, and why the things in the world were made.863 For does not the word say, “Let
Us make man in our image, and after our likeness?”864 What kind of man? Manifestly He
means fleshly man, For the word says, “And God took dust of the earth, and made man.”865
It is evident, therefore, that man made in the image of God was of flesh. Is it not, then, absurd
to say, that the flesh made by God in His own image is contemptible, and worth nothing?
But that the flesh is with God a precious possession is manifest, first from its being formed
by Him, if at least the image is valuable to the former and artist; and besides, its value can
be gathered from the creation of the rest of the world. For that on account of which the rest
is made, is the most precious of all to the maker.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Does the body cause the soul to sin?</head>
<p>Quite true, say they; yet the flesh is a sinner, so much so, that it forces the soul to sin
along with it. And thus they vainly accuse it, and lay to its charge alone the sins of both. But
in what instance can the flesh possibly sin by itself, if it have not the soul going before it and
inciting it? For as in the case of a yoke of oxen, if one or other is loosed from the yoke,
neither of them can plough alone; so neither can soul or body alone effect anything, if they
be unyoked from their communion. And if it is the flesh that is the sinner, then on its account
alone did the Saviour come, as He says, “I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.”866 Since, then, the flesh has been proved to be valuable in the sight of God,
and glorious above all His works, it would very justly be saved by Him.</p>
<p>We must meet, therefore, those who say, that even though it be the special handiwork
of God, and beyond all else valued by Him, it would not immediately follow that it has the
promise of the resurrection. Yet is it not absurd, that that which has been produced with
such circumstance, and which is beyond all else valuable, should be so neglected by its
Maker, as to pass to nonentity? Then the sculptor and painter, if they wish the works they
have made to endure, that they may win glory by them, renew them when they begin to
decay; but God would so neglect His own possession and work, that it becomes annihilated,
and no longer exists. Should we not call this labour in vain? As if a man who has built a
house should forthwith destroy it, or should neglect it, though he sees it falling into decay,
and is able to repair it: we would blame him for labouring in vain; and should we not so
blame God? But not such an one is the Incorruptible,—not senseless is the Intelligence of
the universe. Let the unbelieving be silent, even though they themselves do not believe.</p>
<p>But, in truth, He has even called the flesh to the resurrection, and promises to it everlasting
life. For where He promises to save man, there He gives the promise to the flesh. For
what is man but the reasonable animal composed of body and soul? Is the soul by itself man?
No; but the soul of man. Would the body be called man? No, but it is called the body of
man. If, then, neither of these is by itself man, but that which is made up of the two together
is called man, and God has called man to life and resurrection, He has called not a part, but
the whole, which is the soul and the body. Since would it not be unquestionably absurd, if,
while these two are in the same being and according to the same law, the one were saved
and the other not? And if it be not impossible, as has already been proved, that the flesh be
regenerated, what is the distinction on the ground of which the soul is saved and the body
not? Do they make God a grudging God? But He is good, and will have all to be saved. And
by God and His proclamation, not only has your soul heard and believed on Jesus Christ,
<note type="footnote">866 Mark ii. 17.</note>


<pb n="803"/>
and with it the flesh,867 but both were washed, and both wrought righteousness. They make
God, then ungrateful and unjust, if, while both believe on Him, He desires to save one and
not the other. Well, they say, but the soul is incorruptible, being a part of God and inspired
by Him, and therefore He desires to save what is peculiarly His own and akin to Himself;
but the flesh is corruptible, and not from Him, as the soul is. Then what thanks are due to
Him, and what manifestation of His power and goodness is it, if He purposed to save what
is by nature saved and exists as a part of Himself? For it had its salvation from itself; so that
in saving the soul, God does no great thing. For to be saved is its natural destiny, because it
is a part of Himself, being His inspiration. But no thanks are due to one who saves what is
his own; for this is to save himself. For he who saves a part himself, saves himself by his own
means, lest he become defective in that part; and this is not the act of a good man. For not
even when a man does good to his children and offspring, does one call him a good man;
for even the most savage of the wild beasts do so, and indeed willingly endure death, if need
be, for the sake of their cubs. But if a man were to perform the same acts in behalf of his
slaves, that man would justly be called good. Wherefore the Saviour also taught us to love
our enemies, since, says He, what thank have ye? So that He has shown us that it is a good
work not only to love those that are begotten of Him, but also those that are without. And
what He enjoins upon us, He Himself first of all does.868</p>
<note type="footnote">867 Migne proposes to read here καὶ οὐ σὺν αὐτῇ, “without the flesh,” which gives a more obvious meaning.

<head>Chapter IX.—The resurrection of Christ proves that the body rises.</head>
<p>If He had no need of the flesh, why did He heal it? And what is most forcible of all, He
raised the dead. Why? Was it not to show what the resurrection should be? How then did
He raise the dead? Their souls or their bodies? Manifestly both. If the resurrection were only
spiritual, it was requisite that He, in raising the dead, should show the body lying apart by
itself, and the soul living apart by itself. But now He did not do so, but raised the body,
confirming in it the promise of life. Why did He rise in the flesh in which He suffered, unless
to show the resurrection of the flesh? And wishing to confirm this, when His disciples did
not know whether to believe He had truly risen in the body, and were looking upon Him
and doubting, He said to them, “Ye have not yet faith, see that it is I;”869 and He let them
handle Him, and showed them the prints of the nails in His hands. And when they were by
every kind of proof persuaded that it was Himself, and in the body, they asked Him to eat
with them, that they might thus still more accurately ascertain that He had in verity risen
bodily; and He did eat honey-comb and fish. And when He had thus shown them that there
is truly a resurrection of the flesh, wishing to show them this also, that it is not impossible
for flesh to ascend into heaven (as He had said that our dwelling-place is in heaven), “He
was taken up into heaven while they beheld,”870 as He was in the flesh. If, therefore, after
all that has been said, any one demand demonstration of the resurrection, he is in no respect
different from the Sadducees, since the resurrection of the flesh is the power of God, and,
being above all reasoning, is established by faith, and seen in works.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The body saved, and will therefore rise.</head>
<p>The resurrection is a resurrection of the flesh which died. For the spirit dies not; the
soul is in the body, and without a soul it cannot live. The body, when the soul forsakes it, is
not. For the body is the house of the soul; and the soul the house of the spirit. These three,
in all those who cherish a sincere hope and unquestioning faith in God, will be saved. Considering,
therefore, even such arguments as are suited to this world, and finding that, even
according to them, it is not impossible that the flesh be regenerated; and seeing that, besides
all these proofs, the Saviour in the whole Gospel shows that there is salvation for the flesh,
why do we any longer endure those unbelieving and dangerous arguments, and fail to see
that we are retrograding when we listen to such an argument as this: that the soul is immortal,
but the body mortal, and incapable of being revived? For this we used to hear from Pythagoras
and Plato, even before we learned the truth. If then the Saviour said this, and proclaimed
salvation to the soul alone, what new thing, beyond what we heard from Pythagoras and
Plato and all their band, did He bring us? But now He has come proclaiming the glad tidings
of a new and strange hope to men. For indeed it was a strange and new thing for God to
promise that He would not keep incorruption in incorruption, but would make corruption
incorruption. But because the prince of wickedness could in no other way corrupt the truth,
he sent forth his apostles (evil men who introduced pestilent doctrines), choosing them
from among those who crucified our Saviour; and these men bore the name of the Saviour,
but did the works of him that sent them, through whom the name itself has been spoken
against. But if the flesh do not rise, why is it also guarded, and why do we not rather suffer
it to indulge its desires? Why do we not imitate physicians, who, it is said, when they get a
patient that is despaired of and incurable, allow him to indulge his desires? For they know
that he is dying; and this indeed those who hate the flesh surely do, casting it out of its inheritance,
so far as they can; for on this account they also despise it, because it is shortly to
become a corpse. But if our physician Christ, God, having rescued us from our desires,
regulates our flesh with His own wise and temperate rule, it is evident that He guards it from
sins because it possesses a hope of salvation, as physicians do not suffer men whom they
hope to save to indulge in what pleasures they please.871</p>

<p>By the two birds873 Christ is denoted, both dead as man, and living as God. He is likened
to a bird, because He is understood and declared to be from above, and from heaven. And
the living bird, having been dipped in the blood of the dead one, was afterwards let go. For
the living and divine Word was in the crucified and dead temple [of the body], as being a
partaker of the passion, and yet impassible to God.</p>
<p>By that which took place in the running874 water, in which the wood and the hyssop
and the scarlet were dipped, is set forth the bloody passion of Christ on the cross for the
salvation of those who are sprinkled with the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. Wherefore
the material for purification was not provided chiefly with reference to leprosy, but with
regard to the forgiveness of sins, that both leprosy might be understood to be an emblem
of sin, and the things which were sacrificed an emblem of Him who was to be sacrificed for
sins.</p>
<p>For this reason, consequently, he ordered that the scarlet should be dipped at the same
time in the water, thus predicting that the flesh should no longer possess its natural [evil]
properties. For this reason, also, were there the two birds, the one being sacrificed in the
water, and the other dipped both in the blood and in the water and then sent away, just as
is narrated also respecting the goats. </p>
<p>The goat that was sent away presented a type of Him who taketh away the sins of men.

<p>When God formed man at the beginning, He suspended the things of nature on his will,
and made an experiment by means of one commandment. For He ordained that, if he kept
this, he should partake of immortal existence; but if he transgressed it, the contrary should
be his lot. Man having been thus made, and immediately looking towards transgression,
naturally became subject to corruption. Corruption then becoming inherent in nature, it
was necessary that He who wished to save should be one who destroyed the efficient cause
of corruption. And this could not otherwise be done than by the life which is according to
nature being united to that which had received the corruption, and so destroying the corruption,
while preserving as immortal for the future that which had received it. It was
therefore necessary that the Word should become possessed of a body, that He might deliver
us from the death of natural corruption. For if, as ye875 say, He had simply by a nod warded
off death from us, death indeed would not have approached us on account of the expression
of His will; but none the less would we again have become corruptible, inasmuch as we
carried about in ourselves that natural corruption.—Leontius against Eutychians, etc., book
ii.</p>

at length on the number six, he declares that all things which have been framed by God are
divided into six classes,—viz., into things intelligent and immortal, such as are the angels;
into things reasonable and mortal, such as mankind; into things sensitive and irrational,
such as cattle, and birds, and fishes; into things that can advance, and move, and are insensible,
such as the winds, and the clouds, and the waters, and the stars; into things which increase
and are immoveable, such as the trees; and into things which are insensible and immoveable,
such as the mountains, the earth, and such like. For all the creatures of God, in
heaven and on earth, fall under one or other of these divisions, and are circumscribed by
them.— From the writings of Anastasius.</p>

<head>Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Justin Martyr</head>
<p>Crescens, a cynic, has the ill-renown of stirring up the persecution in which Justin and
his friends suffered for Christ. The story that he died by the hemlock seems to have originated
among the Greeks, who naturally gave this turn to the sufferings of a philosopher. The following
Introductory Notice of the translator supplies all that need be added.</p>
<p>Though nothing is known as to the date or authorship of the following narrative, it is
generally reckoned among the most trustworthy of the Martyria. An absurd addition was
in some copies made to it, to the effect that Justin died by means of hemlock. Some have
thought it necessary, on account of this story, to conceive of two Justins, one of whom, the
celebrated defender of the Christian faith whose writings are given in this volume, died
through poison, while the other suffered in the way here described, along with several of
his friends. But the description of Justin given in the following account, is evidently such as
compels us to refer it to the famous apologist and martyr of the second century.878</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Examination of Justin by the prefect.</head>
<p>In the time of the lawless partisans of idolatry, wicked decrees were passed against the
godly Christians in town and country, to force them to offer libations to vain idols; and accordingly
the holy men, having been apprehended, were brought before the prefect of Rome,
Rusticus by name. And when they had been brought before his judgment-seat, Rusticus the
prefect said to Justin, “Obey the gods at once, and submit to the kings.”879 Justin said, “To
obey the commandments of our Saviour Jesus Christ is worthy neither of blame nor of
condemnation.” Rusticus the prefect said, “What kind of doctrines do you profess?” Justin
said, “I have endeavoured to learn all doctrines; but I have acquiesced at last in the true
doctrines, those namely of the Christians, even though they do not please those who hold
false opinions.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Are those the doctrines that please you, you utterly
wretched man?” Justin said, “Yes, since I adhere to them with right dogma.”880 Rusticus
the prefect said, “What is the dogma?” Justin said, “That according to which we worship
the God of the Christians, whom we reckon to be one from the beginning, the maker and
fashioner of the whole creation, visible and invisible; and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, who had also been preached beforehand by the prophets as about to be present with
the race of men, the herald of salvation and teacher of good disciples. And I, being a man,
think that what I can say is insignificant in comparison with His boundless divinity, acknowledging
a certain prophetic power,881 since it was prophesied concerning Him of whom
now I say that He is the Son of God. For I know that of old the prophets foretold His appearance
among men.”</p>

<p>Rusticus the prefect said, “Where do you assemble?” Justin said, “Where each one

the God of the Christians is not circumscribed by place; but being invisible, fills heaven and
earth, and everywhere is worshipped and glorified by the faithful.” Rusticus the prefect said,
“Tell me where you assemble, or into what place do you collect your followers?” Justin said,
“I live above one Martinus, at the Timiotinian Bath; and during the whole time (and I am
now living in Rome for the second time) I am unaware of any other meeting than his. And
if any one wished to come to me, I communicated to him the doctrines of truth.” Rusticus
said, “Are you not, then, a Christian?” Justin said, “Yes, I am a Christian.”</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Examination of Chariton and others.</head>
<p>Then said the prefect Rusticus to Chariton, “Tell me further, Chariton, are you also a
Christian?” Chariton said, “I am a Christian by the command of God.” Rusticus the prefect
asked the woman Charito, “What say you, Charito?” Charito said, “I am a Christian by the
grace of God.” Rusticus said to Euelpistus, “And what are you?” Euelpistus, a servant of
Cæsar, answered, “I too am a Christian, having been freed by Christ; and by the grace of
Christ I partake of the same hope.” Rusticus the prefect said to Hierax, “And you, are you
a Christian?” Hierax said, “Yes, I am a Christian, for I revere and worship the same God.”
Rusticus the prefect said, “Did Justin make you Christians?” Hierax said, “I was a Christian,
and will be a Christian.” And Pæon stood up and said, “I too am a Christian.” Rusticus the
prefect said, “Who taught you?” Pæon said, “From our parents we received this good confession.”
Euelpistus said, “I willingly heard the words of Justin. But from my parents also I
learned to be a Christian.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Where are your parents?” Euelpistus
said, “In Cappadocia.” Rusticus says to Hierax, “Where are your parents?” And he answered,
and said, “Christ is our true father, and faith in Him is our mother; and my earthly parents
died; and I, when I was driven from Iconium in Phrygia, came here.” Rusticus the prefect
said to Liberianus, “And what say you? Are you a Christian, and unwilling to worship [the
gods]?” Liberianus said, “I too am a Christian, for I worship and reverence the only true
God.”</p>

<p>The prefect says to Justin, “Hearken, you who are called learned, and think that you
know true doctrines; if you are scourged and beheaded, do you believe you will ascend into
heaven?” Justin said, “I hope that, if I endure these things, I shall have His gifts.882 For I
know that, to all who have thus lived, there abides the divine favour until the completion
of the whole world.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Do you suppose, then, that you will ascend
into heaven to receive some recompense?” Justin said, “I do not suppose it, but I know and
am fully persuaded of it.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Let us, then, now come to the matter
in hand, and which presses. Having come together, offer sacrifice with one accord to the
gods.” Justin said, “No right-thinking person falls away from piety to impiety.” Rusticus the
prefect said, “Unless ye obey, ye shall be mercilessly punished.” Justin said, “Through
prayer we can be saved on account of our Lord Jesus Christ, even when we have been punished,
883 because this shall become to us salvation and confidence at the more fearful and
universal judgment-seat of our Lord and Saviour.” Thus also said the other martyrs: “Do
what you will, for we are Christians, and do not sacrifice to idols.”</p>

suffer the punishment of decapitation, according to the laws.” The holy martyrs having
glorified God, and having gone forth to the accustomed place, were beheaded, and perfected
their testimony in the confession of the Saviour. And some of the faithful having secretly
removed their bodies, laid them in a suitable place, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ having
wrought along with them, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="834"/>
<head>Introductory Note to Irenæus Against Heresies</head>
<p>[a.d. 120–202.] This history introduces us to the Church in her Western outposts. We
reach the banks of the Rhone, where for nearly a century Christian missions have flourished.
Between Marseilles and Smyrna there seems to have been a brisk trade, and Polycarp had
sent Pothinus into Celtic Gaul at an early date as its evangelist. He had fixed his see at Lyons,
when Irenæus joined him as a presbyter, having been his fellow-pupil under Polycarp. There,
under the “good Aurelius,” as he is miscalled (a.d. 177), arose the terrible persecution which
made “the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne” so memorable. It was during this persecution that
Irenæus was sent to Rome with letters of remonstrance against the rising pestilence of heresy;
and he was probably the author of the account of the sufferings of the martyrs which is appended
to their testimony.1 But he had the mortification of finding the Montanist heresy
patronized by Eleutherus the Bishop of Rome; and there he met an old friend from the
school of Polycarp, who had embraced the Valentinian heresy. We cannot doubt that to
this visit we owe the lifelong struggle of Irenæus against the heresies that now came in, like
locusts, to devour the harvests of the Gospel. But let it be noted here, that, so far from being
“the mother and mistress” of even the Western Churches, Rome herself is a mission of the
Greeks;2 Southern Gaul is evangelized from Asia Minor, and Lyons checks the heretical
tendencies of the Bishop at Rome. Ante-Nicene Christianity, and indeed the Church herself,
appears in Greek costume which lasts through the synodical period; and Latin Christianity,
when it begins to appear, is African, and not Roman. It is strange that those who have recorded
this great historical fact have so little perceived its bearings upon Roman pretensions
in the Middle Ages and modern times.</p>
<p>Returning to Lyons, our author found that the venerable Pothinus had closed his holy
career by a martyr’s death; and naturally Irenæus became his successor. When the emissaries
of heresy followed him, and began to disseminate their licentious practices and foolish
doctrines by the aid of “silly women,” the great work of his life began. He condescended to
study these diseases of the human mind like a wise physician; and, sickening as was the
process of classifying and describing them, he made this also his laborious task, that he
might enable others to withstand and to overcome them. The works he has left us are
monuments of his fidelity to Christ, and to the charges of St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Jude,
whose solemn warnings now proved to be prophecies. No marvel that the great apostle,
“night and day with tears,” had forewarned the churches of “the grievous wolves” which
were to make havoc of the fold.</p>

<pb n="835"/>
<p>If it shocks the young student of the virgin years of Christianity to find such a state of
things, let him reflect that it was all foretold by Christ himself, and demonstrates the malice
and power of the adversary. “An enemy hath done this,” said the Master. The spirit that was
then working “in the children of disobedience,” now manifested itself. The awful visions
of the Apocalypse began to be realized. It was now evident in what sense “the Prince of
peace” had pronounced His mission, “not peace, but a sword.” In short, it became a conspicuous
fact, that the Church here on earth is “militant;” while, at the same time, there was
seen to be a profound philosophy in the apostolic comment,3 “There must be also heresies
among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest.” In the divine economy
of Providence it was permitted that every form of heresy which was ever to infest the Church
should now exhibit its essential principle, and attract the censures of the faithful. Thus
testimony to primitive truth was secured and recorded: the language of catholic orthodoxy
was developed and defined, and landmarks of faith were set up for perpetual memorial to
all generations. It is a striking example of this divine economy, that the see of Rome was allowed
to exhibit its fallibility very conspicuously at this time, and not only to receive the
rebukes of Irenæus, but to accept them as wholesome and necessary; so that the heresy of
Eleutherus, and the spirit of Diotrephes in Victor, have enabled reformers ever since, and
even in the darkest days of pontifical despotism, to testify against the manifold errors patronized
by Rome. Hilary and other Gallicans have been strengthened by the example of
Irenæus, and by his faithful words of reproof and exhortation, to resist Rome, even down
to our own times.</p>
<p>That the intolerable absurdities of Gnosticism should have gained so many disciples,
and proved itself an adversary to be grappled with and not despised, throws light on the
condition of the human mind under heathenism, even when it professed “knowledge” and
“philosophy.” The task of Irenæus was twofold: (1) to render it impossible for any one to
confound Gnosticism with Christianity, and (2) to make it impossible for such a monstrous
system to survive, or ever to rise again. His task was a nauseous one; but never was the
spirit enjoined by Scripture more patiently exhibited, nor with more entire success.4 If Julian
had found Gnosticism just made to his hand, and powerful enough to suit his purposes, the
whole history of his attempt to revive Paganism would have been widely different. Irenæus
demonstrated its essential unity with the old mythology, and with heathen systems of
philosophy. If the fog and malaria that rose with the Day-star, and obscured it, were speedily
dispersed, our author is largely to be identified with the radiance which flowed from the
Sun of righteousness, and with the breath of the Spirit that banished them for ever.</p>

<note type="footnote">4 2 Tim. ii. 24, 25, 26.</note>

<pb n="836"/>
<p>The Episcopate of Irenæus was distinguished by labours, “in season and out of season,”
for the evangelization of Southern Gaul; and he seems to have sent missionaries into other
regions of what we now call France. In spite of Paganism and heresy, he rendered Lyons a
Christian city; and Marcus seems to have retreated before his terrible castigation, taking
himself off to regions beyond the Pyrenees.5 But the pacific name he bears, was rendered
yet more illustrious by his interposition to compose the Easter Controversy, then threatening
to impair, if not to destroy, the unity of the Church. The beautiful concordat between East
and West, in which Polycarp and Anicetus had left the question, was now disturbed by
Victor, Bishop of Rome, whose turbulent spirit would not accept the compromise of his
predecessor. Irenæus remonstrates with him in a catholic spirit, and overrules his impetuous
temper. At the Council of Nice, the rule for the observance of Easter was finally settled by
the whole Church; and the forbearing example of Irenæus, no doubt contributed greatly to
this happy result. The blessed peacemaker survived this great triumph, for a short time only,
closing his life, like a true shepherd, with thousands of his flock, in the massacre (a.d. 202)
stimulated by the wolfish Emperor Severus.</p>
<p>The Introductory Notice of the learned translators6 is as follows:—</p>
<p>The work of Irenæus Against Heresies is one of the most precious remains of early
Christian antiquity. It is devoted, on the one hand, to an account and refutation of those
multiform Gnostic heresies which prevailed in the latter half of the second century; and, on
the other hand, to an exposition and defence of the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>In the prosecution of this plan, the author divides his work into five books. The first of
these contains a minute description of the tenets of the various heretical sects, with occasional
brief remarks in illustration of their absurdity, and in confirmation of the truth to which
they were opposed. In his second book, Irenæus proceeds to a more complete demolition
of those heresies which he has already explained, and argues at great length against them,
on grounds principally of reason. The three remaining books set forth more directly the
true doctrines of revelation, as being in utter antagonism to the views held by the Gnostic
teachers. In the course of this argument, many passages of Scripture are quoted and commented
on; many interesting statements are made, bearing on the rule of faith; and much
<note type="footnote">5 On the authority of St. Jerome. See Guettée, De l’église de France, vol. 1. p. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">6 The first two books of Irenæus Against Heresies have been translated by Dr. Roberts. The groundwork of
the translation of the third book, and that portion of the fourth book which is continued in this volume, has
been furnished by the Rev. W. H. Rambaut. An attempt has been made, in rendering this important author into
English, to adhere as closely as possible to the original. It would have been far easier to give a loose and flowing
translation of the obscure and involved sentences of Irenæus; but the object has been studiously kept in view,
to place the English reader, as much as possible, in the position of one who has immediate access to the Greek
or Latin text.</note>

<pb n="837"/>
important light is shed on the doctrines, held, as well as the practices observed, by the Church
of the second century.</p>
<p>It may be made matter of regret, that so large a portion of the work of Irenæus is given
to an exposition of the manifold Gnostic speculations. Nothing more absurd than these has
probably ever been imagined by rational beings. Some ingenious and learned men have indeed
endeavoured to reconcile the wild theories of these heretics with the principles of
reason; but, as Bishop Kaye remarks (Eccl. Hist. of the Second and Third Centuries, p. 524),
“a more arduous or unpromising undertaking cannot well be conceived.” The fundamental
object of the Gnostic speculations was doubtless to solve the two grand problems of all religious
philosophy, viz., How to account for the existence of evil; and, How to reconcile the
finite with the infinite. But these ancient theorists were not more successful in grappling
with such questions than have been their successors in modern times. And by giving loose
reins to their imagination, they built up the most incongruous and ridiculous systems; while,
by deserting the guidance of Scripture they were betrayed into the most pernicious and extravagant
errors.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the patience of the reader is sorely tried, in following our author through
those mazes of absurdity which he treads, in explaining and refuting these Gnostic speculations.
This is especially felt in the perusal of the first two books, which, as has been said, are
principally devoted to an exposition and subversion of the various heretical systems. But
the vagaries of the human mind, however melancholy in themselves, are never altogether
destitute of instruction. And in dealing with those set before us in this work, we have not
only the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with the currents of thought prevalent in these
early times, but we obtain much valuable information regarding the primitive Church,
which, had it not been for these heretical schemes, might never have reached our day.</p>
<p>Not a little of what is contained in the following pages will seem almost unintelligible
to the English reader. And it is scarcely more comprehensible to those who have pondered
long on the original. We have inserted brief notes of explanation where these seemed specially
necessary. But we have not thought it worth while to devote a great deal of space to the
elucidation of those obscure Gnostic views which, in so many varying forms, are set forth
in this work. For the same reason, we give here no account of the origin, history, and successive
phases of Gnosticism. Those who wish to know the views of the learned on these
points, may consult the writings of Neander, Baur, and others, among the Germans, or the
lectures of Dr. Burton in English; while a succinct description of the whole matter will be
found in the “Preliminary Observations on the Gnostic System,” prefixed to Harvey’s edition
of Irenæus.</p>
<p>The great work of Irenæus, now for the first time translated into English, is unfortunately
no longer extant in the original. It has come down to us only in an ancient Latin version,
with the exception of the greater part of the first book, which has been preserved in the

<pb n="838"/>
original Greek, through means of copious quotations made by Hippolytus and Epiphanius.
The text, both Latin and Greek, is often most uncertain. Only three mss. of the work Against
Heresies are at present known to exist. Others, however, were used in the earliest printed
editions put forth by Erasmus. And as these codices were more ancient than any now
available, it is greatly to be regretted that they have disappeared or perished. One of our
difficulties throughout, has been to fix the readings we should adopt, especially in the first
book. Varieties of reading, actual or conjectural, have been noted only when some point of
special importance seemed to be involved.</p>
<p>After the text has been settled, according to the best judgment which can be formed,
the work of translation remains; and that is, in this case, a matter of no small difficulty.
Irenæus, even in the original Greek, is often a very obscure writer. At times he expresses
himself with remarkable clearness and terseness; but, upon the whole, his style is very involved
and prolix. And the Latin version adds to these difficulties of the original, by being
itself of the most barbarous character. In fact, it is often necessary to make a conjectural retranslation
of it into Greek, in order to obtain some inkling of what the author wrote.
Dodwell supposes this Latin version to have been made about the end of the fourth century;
but as Tertullian seems to have used it, we must rather place it in the beginning of the third.
Its author is unknown, but he was certainly little qualified for his task. We have endeavoured
to give as close and accurate a translation of the work as possible, but there are not a few
passages in which a guess can only be made as to the probable meaning.</p>
<p>Irenæus had manifestly taken great pains to make himself acquainted with the various
heretical systems which he describes. His mode of exposing and refuting these is generally
very effective. It is plain that he possessed a good share of learning, and that he had a firm
grasp of the doctrines of Scripture. Not unfrequently he indulges in a kind of sarcastic humour,
while inveighing against the folly and impiety of the heretics. But at times he gives
expression to very strange opinions. He is, for example, quite peculiar in imagining that our
Lord lived to be an old man, and that His public ministry embraced at least ten years. But
though, on these and some other points, the judgment of Irenæus is clearly at fault, his work
contains a vast deal of sound and valuable exposition of Scripture, in opposition to the
fanciful systems of interpretation which prevailed in his day.</p>
<p>We possess only very scanty accounts of the personal history of Irenæus. It has been
generally supposed that he was a native of Smyrna, or some neighbouring city, in Asia
Minor. Harvey, however, thinks that he was probably born in Syria, and removed in boyhood
to Smyrna. He himself tells us (iii. 3, 4) that he was in early youth acquainted with Polycarp,
the illustrious bishop of that city. A sort of clue is thus furnished as to the date of his birth.
Dodwell supposes that he was born so early as a.d. 97, but this is clearly a mistake; and the
general date assigned to his birth is somewhere between a.d. 120 and a.d. 140.</p>

<pb n="839"/>
<p>It is certain that Irenæus was bishop of Lyons, in France, during the latter quarter of
the second century. The exact period or circumstances of his ordination cannot be determined.
Eusebius states (Hist. Eccl., v. 4) that he was, while yet a presbyter, sent with a letter,
from certain members of the Church of Lyons awaiting martyrdom, to Eleutherus, bishop
of Rome; and that (v. 5) he succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons, probably about a.d. 177.
His great work Against Heresies was, we learn, written during the episcopate of Eleutherus,
that is, between a.d. 182 and a.d. 188, for Victor succeeded to the bishopric of Rome in a.d.
189. This new bishop of Rome took very harsh measures for enforcing uniformity
throughout the Church as to the observance of the paschal solemnities. On account of the
severity thus evinced, Irenæus addressed to him a letter (only a fragment of which remains),
warning him that if he persisted in the course on which he had entered, the effect would be
to rend the Catholic Church in pieces. This letter had the desired result; and the question
was more temperately debated, until finally settled by the Council of Nice.</p>
<p>The full title of the principal work of Irenæus, as given by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., v. 7),
and indicated frequently by the author himself, was A Refutation and Subversion of Knowledge
falsely so called, but it is generally referred to under the shorter title, Against Heresies.
Several other smaller treatises are ascribed to Irenæus; viz., An Epistle to Florinus, of which
a small fragment has been preserved by Eusebius; a treatise On the Valentinian Ogdoad; a
work called forth by the paschal controversy, entitled On Schism, and another On Science;
all of which that remain will be found in our next volume of his writings. Irenæus is supposed
to have died about a.d. 202; but there is probably no real ground for the statement of Jerome,
repeated by subsequent writers, that he suffered martyrdom, since neither Tertullian nor
Eusebius, nor other early authorities, make any mention of such a fact.</p>
<p>As has been already stated, the first printed copy of our author was given to the world
by Erasmus. This was in the year 1526. Between that date and 1571, a number of reprints
were produced in both folio and octavo. All these contained merely the ancient barbarous
Latin version, and were deficient towards the end by five entire chapters. These latter were
supplied by the edition of Feuardent, Professor of Divinity at Paris, which was published in
1575, and went through six subsequent editions. Previously to this, however, another had
been set forth by Gallasius, a minister of Geneva, which contained the first portions of the
Greek text from Epiphanius. Then, in 1702, came the edition of Grabe, a learned Prussian,
who had settled in England. It was published at Oxford, and contained considerable additions
to the Greek text, with fragments. Ten years after this there appeared the important Paris
edition by the Benedictine monk Massuet. This was reprinted at Venice in the year 1724,
in two thin folio volumes, and again at Paris in a large octavo, by the Abbé Migne, in 1857.
A German edition was published by Stieren in 1853. In the year 1857 there was also brought
out a Cambridge edition, by the Rev. Wigan Harvey, in two octavo volumes. The two principal
features of this edition are: the additions which have been made to the Greek text from

<pb n="840"/>
the recently discovered Philosophoumena of Hippolytus; and the further addition of thirtytwo
fragments of a Syriac version of the Greek text of Irenæus, culled from the Nitrian collection
of Syriac mss. in the British Museum. These fragments are of considerable interest,
and in some instances rectify the readings of the barbarous Latin version, where, without
such aid, it would have been unintelligible. The edition of Harvey will be found constantly
referred to in the notes appended to our translation.</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>1. Inasmuch7 as certain men have set the truth aside, and bring in lying words and vain
genealogies, which, as the apostle says,8 “minister questions rather than godly edifying which
is in faith,” and by means of their craftily-constructed plausibilities draw away the minds
of the inexperienced and take them captive, [I have felt constrained, my dear friend, to
compose the following treatise in order to expose and counteract their machinations.] These
men falsify the oracles of God, and prove themselves evil interpreters of the good word of
revelation. They also overthrow the faith of many, by drawing them away, under a pretence
of [superior] knowledge, from Him who founded and adorned the universe; as if, forsooth,
they had something more excellent and sublime to reveal, than that God who created the
heaven and the earth, and all things that are therein. By means of specious and plausible
words, they cunningly allure the simple-minded to inquire into their system; but they nevertheless
clumsily destroy them, while they initiate them into their blasphemous and impious
opinions respecting the Demiurge;9 and these simple ones are unable, even in such a matter,
to distinguish falsehood from truth.</p>
<p>2. Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest, being thus exposed, it
should at once be detected. But it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress, so as, by its
outward form, to make it appear to the inexperienced (ridiculous as the expression may
seem) more true than the truth itself. One10 far superior to me has well said, in reference
to this point, “A clever imitation in glass casts contempt, as it were, on that precious jewel

made from it by subsequent writers, especially by the author’s pupil Hippolytus, and by Epiphanius. The latter
preserves (Hær. xxxi. secs. 9–32) the preface of Irenæus, and most of the first book. An important difference of
reading occurs between the Latin and Greek in the very first word. The translator manifestly read ἐπεί, quatenus,
while in Epiphanius we find ἐπί, against. The former is probably correct, and has been followed in our version.
We have also supplied a clause, in order to avoid the extreme length of the sentence in the original, which runs
on without any apodosis to the words ἀναγκαῖον ἡγησάμην, “I have judged it necessary.”</note>

detect the presence of brass when it has been mixed up with silver?” Lest, therefore, through
my neglect, some should be carried off, even as sheep are by wolves, while they perceive not
the true character of these men,—because they outwardly are covered with sheep’s clothing
(against whom the Lord has enjoined11 us to be on our guard), and because their language
resembles ours, while their sentiments are very different,—I have deemed it my duty (after
reading some of the Commentaries, as they call them, of the disciples of Valentinus, and
after making myself acquainted with their tenets through personal intercourse with some
of them) to unfold to thee, my friend, these portentous and profound mysteries, which do
not fall within the range of every intellect, because all have not sufficiently purged12 their
brains. I do this, in order that thou, obtaining an acquaintance with these things, mayest in
turn explain them to all those with whom thou art connected, and exhort them to avoid
such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy against Christ. I intend, then, to the best of my
ability, with brevity and clearness to set forth the opinions of those who are now promulgating
heresy. I refer especially to the disciples of Ptolemæus, whose school may be described
as a bud from that of Valentinus. I shall also endeavour, according to my moderate ability,
to furnish the means of overthrowing them, by showing how absurd and inconsistent with
the truth are their statements. Not that I am practised either in composition or eloquence;
but my feeling of affection prompts me to make known to thee and all thy companions those
doctrines which have been kept in concealment until now, but which are at last, through
the goodness of God, brought to light. “For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed,
nor secret that shall not be made known.”13</p>

for the most part to use a barbarous dialect, any display of rhetoric, which I have
never learned, or any excellence of composition, which I have never practised, or any beauty
and persuasiveness of style, to which I make no pretensions. But thou wilt accept in a kindly
spirit what I in a like spirit write to thee simply, truthfully, and in my own homely way;

<pb n="845"/>
<head>Chapter I.—Absurd ideas of the disciples of Valentinus as to the origin, name,
order, and conjugal productions of their fancied Æons, with the passages of
Scripture which they adapt to their opinions.</head>
<p>1. They maintain, then, that in the invisible and ineffable heights above there exists a
certain perfect, pre-existent Æon,16 whom they call Proarche, Propator, and Bythus, and
describe as being invisible and incomprehensible. Eternal and unbegotten, he remained
throughout innumerable cycles of ages in profound serenity and quiescence. There existed
along with him Ennoea, whom they also call Charis and Sige.17 At last this Bythus determined
to send forth from himself the beginning of all things, and deposited this production (which
he had resolved to bring forth) in his contemporary Sige, even as seed is deposited in the
womb. She then, having received this seed, and becoming pregnant, gave birth to Nous,
who was both similar and equal to him who had produced him, and was alone capable of
comprehending his father’s greatness. This Nous they call also Monogenes, and Father, and
the Beginning of all Things. Along with him was also produced Aletheia; and these four
constituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad, which they also denominate
the root of all things. For there are first Bythus and Sige, and then Nous and Aletheia. And
Monogenes, perceiving for what purpose he had been produced, also himself sent forth
Logos and Zoe, being the father of all those who were to come after him, and the beginning
and fashioning of the entire Pleroma. By the conjunction of Logos and Zoe were brought
forth Anthropos and Ecclesia; and thus was formed the first-begotten Ogdoad, the root and
substance of all things, called among them by four names, viz., Bythus, and Nous, and Logos,
and Anthropos. For each of these is masculo-feminine, as follows: Propator was united by
a conjunction with his Ennoea; then Monogenes, that is Nous, with Aletheia; Logos with
Zoe, and Anthropos with Ecclesia.</p>
<p>2. These Æons having been produced for the glory of the Father, and wishing, by their
own efforts, to effect this object, sent forth emanations by means of conjunction. Logos and
Zoe, after producing Anthropos and Ecclesia, sent forth other ten Æons, whose names are
<note type="footnote">16 This term Æon (Αἰών) seems to have been formed from the words ἀεὶ ὤν, ever-existing. “We may take
αἰών, therefore,” says Harvey (Irenæus, cxix.), “in the Valentinian acceptation of the word, to mean an emanation
from the divine substance, subsisting co-ordinately and co-eternally with the Deity, the Pleroma still remaining
one.”</note>
<note type="footnote">17 Sige, however, was no true consort of Bythus, who included in himself the idea of male and female, and
was the one cause of all things: comp. Hippolytus, Philosop., vi. 29. There seems to have been considerable disagreement
among these heretics as to the completion of the mystical number thirty. Valentinus himself appears
to have considered Bythus as a monad, and Sige as a mere nonentity. The two latest Æons, Christ and the Holy
Spirit, would then complete the number thirty. But other Gnostic teachers included both Bythus and Sige in
that mystical number.</note>
<pb n="846"/>
the following: Bythius and Mixis, Ageratos and Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos
and Syncrasis, Monogenes and Macaria.18 These are the ten Æons whom they declare to
have been produced by Logos and Zoe. They then add that Anthropos himself, along with
Ecclesia, produced twelve Æons, to whom they give the following names: Paracletus and
Pistis, Patricos and Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes,
Theletos and Sophia.</p>
<p>3. Such are the thirty Æons in the erroneous system of these men; and they are described
as being wrapped up, so to speak, in silence, and known to none [except these professing
teachers]. Moreover, they declare that this invisible and spiritual Pleroma of theirs is tripartite,
being divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. And for this reason they affirm
it was that the “Saviour”— for they do not please to call Him “Lord”—did no work in public
during the space of thirty years,19 thus setting forth the mystery of these Æons. They
maintain also, that these thirty Æons are most plainly indicated in the parable20 of the labourers
sent into the vineyard. For some are sent about the first hour, others about the third
hour, others about the sixth hour, others about the ninth hour, and others about the eleventh
hour. Now, if we add up the numbers of the hours here mentioned, the sum total will be
thirty: for one, three, six, nine, and eleven, when added together, form thirty. And by the
hours, they hold that the Æons were pointed out; while they maintain that these are great,
and wonderful, and hitherto unspeakable mysteries which it is their special function to develop;
and so they proceed when they find anything in the multitude21 of things contained
in the Scriptures which they can adopt and accommodate to their baseless speculations.</p>
<note type="footnote">18 It may be well to give here the English equivalents of the names of these Æons and their authors. They are
as follows: Bythus, Profundity; Proarche, First-Beginning; Propator, First-Father; Ennoea, Idea; Charis, Grace;

<head>Chapter II.—The Propator was known to Monogenes alone. Ambition,
disturbance, and danger into which Sophia fell; her shapeless offspring: she is
restored by Horos. The production of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, in order to
the completion of the Æons. Manner of the production of Jesus.</head>
<p>1. They proceed to tell us that the Propator of their scheme was known only to Monogenes,
who sprang from him; in other words, only to Nous, while to all the others he was
invisible and incomprehensible. And, according to them, Nous alone took pleasure in contemplating
the Father, and exulting in considering his immeasurable greatness; while he
also meditated how he might communicate to the rest of the Æons the greatness of the
Father, revealing to them how vast and mighty he was, and how he was without beginning,—
beyond comprehension, and altogether incapable of being seen. But, in accordance
with the will of the Father, Sige restrained him, because it was his design to lead them all to
an acquaintance with the aforesaid Propator, and to create within them a desire of investigating
his nature. In like manner, the rest of the Æons also, in a kind of quiet way, had a wish
to behold the Author of their being, and to contemplate that First Cause which had no beginning.</p>
<p>2. But there rushed forth in advance of the rest that Æon who was much the latest of
them, and was the youngest of the Duodecad which sprang from Anthropos and Ecclesia,
namely Sophia, and suffered passion apart from the embrace of her consort Theletos. This
passion, indeed, first arose among those who were connected with Nous and Aletheia, but
passed as by contagion to this degenerate Æon, who acted under a pretence of love, but was
in reality influenced by temerity, because she had not, like Nous, enjoyed communion with
the perfect Father. This passion, they say, consisted in a desire to search into the nature of
the Father; for she wished, according to them, to comprehend his greatness. When she could
not attain her end, inasmuch as she aimed at an impossibility, and thus became involved in
an extreme agony of mind, while both on account of the vast profundity as well as the unsearchable
nature of the Father, and on account of the love she bore him, she was ever
stretching herself forward, there was danger lest she should at last have been absorbed by
his sweetness, and resolved into his absolute essence, unless she had met with that Power
which supports all things, and preserves them outside of the unspeakable greatness. This
power they term Horos; by whom, they say, she was restrained and supported; and that
then, having with difficulty been brought back to herself, she was convinced that the Father
is incomprehensible, and so laid aside her original design, along with that passion which
had arisen within her from the overwhelming influence of her admiration.</p>
<p>3. But others of them fabulously describe the passion and restoration of Sophia as follows:
They say that she, having engaged in an impossible and impracticable attempt, brought


<pb n="848"/>
forth an amorphous substance, such as her female nature enabled her to produce.22 When
she looked upon it, her first feeling was one of grief, on account of the imperfection of its
generation, and then of fear lest this should end23 her own existence. Next she lost, as it
were, all command of herself, and was in the greatest perplexity while endeavouring to
discover the cause of all this, and in what way she might conceal what had happened. Being
greatly harassed by these passions, she at last changed her mind, and endeavoured to return
anew to the Father. When, however, she in some measure made the attempt, strength failed
her, and she became a suppliant of the Father. The other Æons, Nous in particular, presented
their supplications along with her. And hence they declare material substance24 had its beginning
from ignorance and grief, and fear and bewilderment.</p>
<p>4. The Father afterwards produces, in his own image, by means of Monogenes, the
above-mentioned Horos, without conjunction,25 masculo-feminine. For they maintain that
sometimes the Father acts in conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself
independent both of male and female. They term this Horos both Stauros and Lytrotes, and
Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges.26 And by this Horos they declare that Sophia
was purified and established, while she was also restored to her proper conjunction. For her
enthymesis (or inborn idea) having been taken away from her, along with its supervening
passion, she herself certainly remained within the Pleroma; but her enthymesis, with its
passion, was separated from her by Horos, fenced27 off, and expelled from that circle. This
enthymesis was, no doubt, a spiritual substance, possessing some of the natural tendencies
<note type="footnote">22 Alluding to the Gnostic notion that, in generation, the male gives form, the female substance. Sophia,
therefore, being a female Æon, gave to her enthymesis substance alone, without form. Comp. Hippol., Philosop.,
vi. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">23 Some render this obscure clause, “lest it should never attain perfection,” but the above seems preferable.
See Hippol., vi. 31, where the fear referred to is extended to the whole Pleroma.</note>
<note type="footnote">24 “The reader will observe the parallel; as the enthymesis of Bythus produced intelligent substance, so the
enthymesis of Sophia resulted in the formation of material substance.”—Harvey.</note>
<note type="footnote">25 Some propose reading these words in the dative rather than the accusative, and thus to make them refer
to the image of the Father.</note>
<note type="footnote">26 The meaning of these terms is as follows: Stauros means primarily a stake, and then a cross; Lytrotes is a
Redeemer; Carpistes, according to Grabe, means an Emancipator, according to Neander a Reaper; Horothetes
is one that fixes boundaries; and Metagoges is explained by Neander as being one that brings back, from the
supposed function of Horos, to bring back all that sought to wander from the special grade of being assigned
them.</note>

of an Æon, but at the same time shapeless and without form, because it had received nothing.
28 And on this account they say that it was an imbecile and feminine production.29</p>
<p>5. After this substance had been placed outside of the Pleroma of the Æons, and its
mother restored to her proper conjunction, they tell us that Monogenes, acting in accordance
with the prudent forethought of the Father, gave origin to another conjugal pair, namely
Christ and the Holy Spirit (lest any of the Æons should fall into a calamity similar to that
of Sophia), for the purpose of fortifying and strengthening the Pleroma, and who at the
same time completed the number of the Æons. Christ then instructed them as to the nature
of their conjunction, and taught them that those who possessed a comprehension of the
Unbegotten were sufficient for themselves.30 He also announced among them what related
to the knowledge of the Father,—namely, that he cannot be understood or comprehended,
nor so much as seen or heard, except in so far as he is known by Monogenes only. And the
reason why the rest of the Æons possess perpetual existence is found in that part of the
Father’s nature which is incomprehensible; but the reason of their origin and formation
was situated in that which may be comprehended regarding him, that is, in the Son.31 Christ,
then, who had just been produced, effected these things among them.</p>
<p>6. But the Holy Spirit32 taught them to give thanks on being all rendered equal among
themselves, and led them to a state of true repose. Thus, then, they tell us that the Æons
were constituted equal to each other in form and sentiment, so that all became as Nous, and
Logos, and Anthropos, and Christus. The female Æons, too, became all as Aletheia, and
Zoe, and Spiritus, and Ecclesia. Everything, then, being thus established, and brought into
a state of perfect rest, they next tell us that these beings sang praises with great joy to the
Propator, who himself shared in the abounding exaltation. Then, out of gratitude for the
great benefit which had been conferred on them, the whole Pleroma of the Æons, with one
design and desire, and with the concurrence of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also
<note type="footnote">28 That is, had not shared in any male influence, but was a purely female production.</note>
<note type="footnote">29 Literally, “fruit.” Harvey remarks on this expression, “that what we understand by emanations, the Gnostic
described as spiritual fructification; and as the seed of a tree is in itself, even in the embryo state, so these various
Æons, as existing always in the divine nature, were co-eternal with it.”</note>
<note type="footnote">30 This is an exceedingly obscure and difficult passage. Harvey’s rendering is: “For, say they, Christ taught
them the nature of their copulæ, (namely,) that being cognisant of their (limited) perception of the Unbegotten
they needed no higher knowledge, and that He enounced,” etc. the words seem scarcely capable of yielding this
sense: we have followed the interpretation of Billius.</note>
<note type="footnote">31 Both the text and meaning are here very doubtful. Some think that the import of the sentence is, that the
knowledge that the Father is incomprehensible secured the continued safety of the Æons, while the same
knowledge conferred upon Monogenes his origin and form.</note>
<note type="footnote">32 The Greek text inserts ἕν, one, before “Holy Spirit.”</note>

setting the seal of His approval on their conduct, brought together whatever each one had
in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness; and uniting all these contributions so as
skilfully to blend the whole, they produced, to the honour and glory of Bythus, a being of
most perfect beauty, the very star of the Pleroma, and the perfect fruit [of it], namely Jesus.
Him they also speak of under the name of Saviour, and Christ, and patronymically, Logos,
and Everything, because He was formed from the contributions of all. And then we are told
that, by way of honour, angels of the same nature as Himself were simultaneously produced,
to act as His body-guard.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Texts of Holy Scripture used by these heretics to support their
opinions.</head>
<p>1. Such, then, is the account they give of what took place within the Pleroma; such the
calamities that flowed from the passion which seized upon the Æon who has been named,
and who was within a little of perishing by being absorbed in the universal substance, through
her inquisitive searching after the Father; such the consolidation33 [of that Æon] from her
condition of agony by Horos, and Stauros, and Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes,
and Metagoges.34 Such also is the account of the generation of the later Æons, namely of
the first Christ and of the Holy Spirit, both of whom were produced by the Father after the
repentance35 [of Sophia], and of the second36 Christ (whom they also style Saviour), who
owed his being to the joint contributions [of the Æons]. They tell us, however, that this
knowledge has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of receiving it, but has
been mystically revealed by the Saviour through means of parables to those qualified for
understanding it. This has been done as follows. The thirty Æons are indicated (as we have
already remarked) by the thirty years during which they say the Saviour performed no
public act, and by the parable of the labourers in the vineyard. Paul also, they affirm, very
clearly and frequently names these Æons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order,
when he says, “To all the generations of the Æons of the Æon.”37 Nay, we ourselves, when
at the giving38 of thanks we pronounce the words, “To Æons of Æons” (for ever and ever),
do set forth these Æons. And, in fine, wherever the words Æon or Æons occur, they at once
refer them to these beings.</p>
<p>2. The production, again, of the Duodecad of the Æons, is indicated by the fact that the
Lord was twelve39 years of age when He disputed with the teachers of the law, and by the
election of the apostles, for of these there were twelve.40 The other eighteen Æons are made
<note type="footnote">33 The reading is here very doubtful. We have followed the text of Grabe (approved by Harvey), ἐξ ἀγῶνος
σύμπηξις.</note>
<note type="footnote">34 These are all names of the same person: see above, ii. 4. Hence some have proposed the reading ἑξαιώνιος
instead of ἐξ ἀγῶνος, alluding to the sixfold appellation of the Æon Horos.</note>

words as a strong expression to denote “for ever.”</note>
<note type="footnote">38 Literally, “at the thanksgiving,” or “eucharist.” Massuet, the Benedictine editor, refers this to the Lord’s
Supper, and hence concludes that some of the ancient liturgies still extant must even then have been in use.

the ancient Latin version translates in the plural, “in gratiarum actionibus.”</note>

manifest in this way: that the Lord, [according to them,] conversed with His disciples for
eighteen months41 after His resurrection from the dead. They also affirm that these eighteen
Æons are strikingly indicated by the first two letters of His name [᾽Ιησοῦς], namely Iota42
and Eta. And, in like manner, they assert that the ten Æons are pointed out by the letter
Iota, which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they tell us the Saviour said, “One
Iota, or one tittle, shall by no means pass away until all be fulfilled.”43</p>
<p>3. They further maintain that the passion which took place in the case of the twelfth
Æon is pointed at by the apostasy of Judas, who was the twelfth apostle, and also by the fact
that Christ suffered in the twelfth month. For their opinion is, that He continued to preach
for one year only after His baptism. The same thing is also most clearly indicated by the
case of the woman who suffered from an issue of blood. For after she had been thus afflicted
during twelve years, she was healed by the advent of the Saviour, when she had touched the
border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, “Who touched
me?”44—teaching his disciples the mystery which had occurred among the Æons, and the
healing of that Æon who had been involved in suffering. For she who had been afflicted
twelve years represented that power whose essence, as they narrate, was stretching itself
forth, and flowing into immensity; and unless she had touched the garment of the Son,45
that is, Aletheia of the first Tetrad, who is denoted by the hem spoken of, she would have
been dissolved into the general essence46 [of which she participated]. She stopped short,
however, and ceased any longer to suffer. For the power that went forth from the Son (and
this power they term Horos) healed her, and separated the passion from her.</p>
<p>4. They moreover affirm that the Saviour47 is shown to be derived from all the Æons,
and to be in Himself everything by the following passage: “Every male that openeth the
womb.”48 For He, being everything, opened the womb49 of the enthymesis of the suffering

Æon, when it had been expelled from the Pleroma. This they also style the second Ogdoad,
of which we shall speak presently. And they state that it was clearly on this account that
Paul said, “And He Himself is all things;”50 and again, “All things are to Him, and of Him
are all things;”51 and further, “In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead;”52 and yet
again, “All things are gathered together by God in Christ.”53 Thus do they interpret these
and any like passages to be found in Scripture.</p>
<p>5. They show, further, that that Horos of theirs, whom they call by a variety of names,
has two faculties,—the one of supporting, and the other of separating; and in so far as he
supports and sustains, he is Stauros, while in so far as he divides and separates, he is Horos.
They then represent the Saviour as having indicated this twofold faculty: first, the sustaining
power, when He said, “Whosoever doth not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me,
cannot be my disciple;”54 and again, “Taking up the cross, follow me;”55 but the separating
power when He said, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”56 They also maintain that
John indicated the same thing when he said, “The fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly
purge the floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn with
fire unquenchable.”57 By this declaration He set forth the faculty of Horos. For that fan they
explain to be the cross (Stauros), which consumes, no doubt, all material58 objects, as fire
does chaff, but it purifies all them that are saved, as a fan does wheat. Moreover, they affirm
that the Apostle Paul himself made mention of this cross in the following words: “The
doctrine of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the
power of God.”59 And again: “God forbid that I should glory in anything60 save in the cross
of Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.”</p>

wicked inventions. And it is not only from the writings of the evangelists and the apostles
that they endeavour to derive proofs for their opinions by means of perverse interpretations

contain many parables and allegories that can frequently be drawn into various senses, according
to the kind of exegesis to which they are subjected. And others62 of them, with great
craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture to their own figments, lead away captive from

<head>Chapter IV.—Account given by the heretics of the formation of Achamoth;
origin of the visible world from her disturbances.</head>
<p>1. The following are the transactions which they narrate as having occurred outside of
the Pleroma: The enthymesis of that Sophia who dwells above, which they also term
Achamoth,63 being removed from the Pleroma, together with her passion, they relate to
have, as a matter of course, become violently excited in those places of darkness and vacuity
[to which she had been banished]. For she was excluded from light64 and the Pleroma, and
was without form or figure, like an untimely birth, because she had received nothing65 [from
a male parent]. But the Christ dwelling on high took pity upon her; and having extended
himself through and beyond Stauros,66 he imparted a figure to her, but merely as respected
substance, and not so as to convey intelligence.67 Having effected this, he withdrew his influence,
and returned, leaving Achamoth to herself, in order that she, becoming sensible of
her suffering as being severed from the Pleroma, might be influenced by the desire of better
things, while she possessed in the meantime a kind of odour of immortality left in her by
Christ and the Holy Spirit. Wherefore also she is called by two names—Sophia after her
father (for Sophia is spoken of as being her father), and Holy Spirit from that Spirit who is
along with Christ. Having then obtained a form, along with intelligence, and being immediately
deserted by that Logos who had been invisibly present with her—that is, by Christ
—she strained herself to discover that light which had forsaken her, but could not effect
her purpose, inasmuch as she was prevented by Horos. And as Horos thus obstructed her
further progress, he exclaimed, Iao,68 whence, they say, this name Iao derived its origin.
And when she could not pass by Horos on account of that passion in which she had been
involved, and because she alone had been left without, she then resigned herself to every
sort of that manifold and varied state of passion to which she was subject; and thus she
suffered grief on the one hand because she had not obtained the object of her desire, and
fear on the other hand, lest life itself should fail her, as light had already done, while, in ad-

dition, she was in the greatest perplexity. All these feelings were associated with ignorance.
And this ignorance of hers was not like that of her mother, the first Sophia, an Æon, due to
degeneracy by means of passion, but to an [innate] opposition [of nature to knowledge].69
Moreover, another kind of passion fell upon her (Achamoth), namely, that of desiring to
return to him who gave her life.</p>
<p>2. This collection [of passions] they declare was the substance of the matter from which
this world was formed. For from [her desire of] returning [to him who gave her life], every
soul belonging to this world, and that of the Demiurge70 himself, derived its origin. All
other things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of
a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity
all the corporeal elements of the world. For at one time, as they affirm, she would weep and
lament on account of being left alone in the midst of darkness and vacuity; while, at another
time, reflecting on the light which had forsaken her, she would be filled with joy, and laugh;
then, again, she would be struck with terror; or, at other times, would sink into consternation
and bewilderment.</p>
<p>3. Now what follows from all this? No light tragedy comes out of it, as the fancy of every
man among them pompously explains, one in one way, and another in another, from what
kind of passion and from what element being derived its origin. They have good reason, as
seems to me, why they should not feel inclined to teach these things to all in public, but only
to such as are able to pay a high price for an acquaintance with such profound mysteries.
For these doctrines are not at all similar to those of which our Lord said, “Freely ye have
received, freely give.”71 They are, on the contrary, abstruse, and portentous, and profound
mysteries, to be got at only with great labour by such as are in love with falsehood. For who
would not expend all that he possessed, if only he might learn in return, that from the tears
of the enthymesis of the Æon involved in passion, seas, and fountains, and rivers, and every
liquid substance derived its origin; that light burst forth from her smile; and that from her
perplexity and consternation the corporeal elements of the world had their formation?</p>
<p>4. I feel somewhat inclined myself to contribute a few hints towards the development
of their system. For when I perceive that waters are in part fresh, such as fountains, rivers,
showers, and so on, and in part salt; such as those in the sea, I reflect with myself that all
such waters cannot be derived from her tears, inasmuch as these are of a saline quality only.
It is clear, therefore, that the waters which are salt are alone those which are derived from
her tears. But it is probable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was covered with
<note type="footnote">69 This sentence is very elliptical in the original, but the sense is as given above. Sophia fell from Gnosis by
degradation; Achamoth never possessed this knowledge, her nature being from the first opposed to it.</note>

perspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may conceive that fountains and
rivers, and all the fresh water in the world, are due to this source. For it is difficult, since we
know that all tears are of the same quality, to believe that waters both salt and fresh proceeded
from them. The more plausible supposition is, that some are from her tears, and some from
her perspiration. And since there are also in the world certain waters which are hot and acrid
in their nature, thou must be left to guess their origin, how and whence. Such are some of
the results of their hypothesis.</p>
<p>5. They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth had passed through all sorts of
passion, and had with difficulty escaped from them, she turned herself to supplicate the
light which had forsaken her, that is, Christ. He, however, having returned to the Pleroma,
and being probably unwilling again to descend from it, sent forth to her the Paraclete, that
is, the Saviour.72 This being was endowed with all power by the Father, who placed everything
under his authority, the Æons73 doing so likewise, so that “by him were all things, visible
and invisible, created, thrones, divinities, dominions.”74 He then was sent to her along with
his contemporary angels. And they related that Achamoth, filled with reverence, at first
veiled herself through modesty, but that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all
his endowments, and had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran forward to meet
him. He then imparted to her form as respected intelligence, and brought healing to her
passions, separating them from her, but not so as to drive them out of thought altogether.
For it was not possible that they should be annihilated as in the former case,75 because they
had already taken root and acquired strength [so as to possess an indestructible existence].
All that he could do was to separate them and set them apart, and then commingle and
condense them, so as to transmute them from incorporeal passion into unorganized matter.76
He then by this process conferred upon them a fitness and a nature to become concretions
and corporeal structures, in order that two substances should be formed,—the one evil,
resulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed to suffering, but originating from
her conversion. And on this account (i.e., on account of this hypostatizing of ideal matter)
they say that the Saviour virtually77 created the world. But when Achamoth was freed from

her passion, she gazed with rapture on the dazzling vision of the angels that were with him;
and in her ecstasy, conceiving by them, they tell us that she brought forth new beings, partly
after her own image, and partly a spiritual progeny after the image of the Saviour’s attendants.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Formation of the Demiurge; description of him. He is the creator
of everything outside of the Pleroma.</head>
<p>1. These three kinds of existence, then, having, according to them, been now
formed,—one from the passion, which was matter; a second from the conversion, which
was animal; and the third, that which she (Achamoth) herself brought forth, which was
spiritual,—she next addressed herself to the task of giving these form. But she could not
succeed in doing this as respected the spiritual existence, because it was of the same nature
with herself. She therefore applied herself to give form to the animal substance which had
proceeded from her own conversion, and to bring forth to light the instructions of the Saviour.
78 And they say she first formed out of animal substance him who is Father and King
of all things, both of these which are of the same nature with himself, that is, animal substances,
which they also call right-handed, and those which sprang from the passion, and
from matter, which they call left-handed. For they affirm that he formed all the things which
came into existence after him, being secretly impelled thereto by his mother. From this circumstance
they style him Metropator,79 Apator, Demiurge, and Father, saying that he is
Father of the substances on the right hand, that is, of the animal, but Demiurge of those on
the left, that is, of the material, while he is at the same time the king of all. For they say that
this Enthymesis, desirous of making all things to the honour of the Æons, formed images
of them, or rather that the Saviour80 did so through her instrumentality. And she, in the
image81 of the invisible Father, kept herself concealed from the Demiurge. But he was in
the image of the only-begotten Son, and the angels and archangels created by him were in
the image of the rest of the Æons.</p>
<p>2. They affirm, therefore, that he was constituted the Father and God of everything
outside of the Pleroma, being the creator of all animal and material substances. For he it
was that discriminated these two kinds of existence hitherto confused, and made corporeal
from incorporeal substances, fashioned things heavenly and earthly, and became the Framer
(Demiurge) of things material and animal, of those on the right and those on the left, of the
light and of the heavy, and of those tending upwards as well as of those tending downwards.
<note type="footnote">78 “In order that,” says Grabe, “this formation might not be merely according to essence, but also according
to knowledge, as the formation of the mother Achamoth was characterized above.”</note>
<note type="footnote">79 Metropator, as proceeding only from his mother Achamoth: Apator, as having no male progenitor.</note>
<note type="footnote">80 Harvey remarks, “The Valentinian Saviour being an aggregation of all the æonic perfections, the images
of them were reproduced by the spiritual conception of Achamoth beholding the glory of Σωτήρ. The reader
will not fail to observe that every successive development is the reflex of a more divine antecedent.”</note>
<note type="footnote">81 The relation indicated seems to be as follows: Achamoth, after being formed “according to knowledge,”
was outside of the Pleroma as the image of Propator, the Demiurge was as Nous, and the mundane angels which
he formed corresponded to the other Æons of the Pleroma.</note>


<pb n="860"/>
He created also seven heavens, above which they say that he, the Demiurge, exists. And on
this account they term him Hebdomas, and his mother Achamoth Ogdoads, preserving the
number of the first-begotten and primary Ogdoad as the Pleroma. They affirm, moreover,
that these seven heavens are intelligent, and speak of them as being angels, while they refer
to the Demiurge himself as being an angel bearing a likeness to God; and in the same strain,
they declare that Paradise, situated above the third heaven, is a fourth angel possessed of
power, from whom Adam derived certain qualities while he conversed with him.</p>
<p>3. They go on to say that the Demiurge imagined that he created all these things of
himself, while he in reality made them in conjunction with the productive power of
Achamoth. He formed the heavens, yet was ignorant of the heavens; he fashioned man, yet
knew not man; he brought to light the earth, yet had no acquaintance with the earth; and,
in like manner, they declare that he was ignorant of the forms of all that he made, and knew
not even of the existence of his own mother, but imagined that he himself was all things.
They further affirm that his mother originated this opinion in his mind, because she desired
to bring him forth possessed of such a character that he should be the head and source of
his own essence, and the absolute ruler over every kind of operation [that was afterwards
attempted]. This mother they also call Ogdoad, Sophia, Terra, Jerusalem, Holy Spirit, and,
with a masculine reference, Lord.82 Her place of habitation is an intermediate one, above
the Demiurge indeed, but below and outside of the Pleroma, even to the end.83</p>
<p>4. As, then, they represent all material substance to be formed from three passions, viz.,
fear, grief, and perplexity, the account they give is as follows: Animal substances originated
from fear and from conversion; the Demiurge they also describe as owing his origin to
conversion; but the existence of all the other animal substances they ascribe to fear, such as
the souls of irrational animals, and of wild beasts, and men. And on this account, he (the
Demiurge), being incapable of recognising any spiritual essences, imagined himself to be
God alone, and declared through the prophets, “I am God, and besides me there is none
else.”84 They further teach that the spirits of wickedness derived their origin from grief.
Hence the devil, whom they also call Cosmocrator (the ruler of the world), and the demons,
and the angels, and every wicked spiritual being that exists, found the source of their existence.
They represent the Demiurge as being the son of that mother of theirs (Achamoth),
and Cosmocrator as the creature of the Demiurge. Cosmocrator has knowledge of what is
above himself, because he is a spirit of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of such
<note type="footnote">82 “Achamoth by these names must be understood to have an intermediate position between the divine
prototypal idea and creation: she was the reflex of the one, and therefore masculo-feminine; she was the pattern
to be realized in the latter, and therefore was named Earth and Jerusalem.” —Harvey.</note>
<note type="footnote">83 But after the consummation here referred to, Achamoth regained the Pleroma: see below, chap. vii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">84 Isa. xlv. 5, 6, Isa. xlvi. 9.</note>


<pb n="861"/>
things, inasmuch as he is merely animal. Their mother dwells in that place which is above
the heavens, that is, in the intermediate abode; the Demiurge in the heavenly place, that is,
in the hebdomad; but the Cosmocrator in this our world. The corporeal elements of the
world, again, sprang, as we before remarked, from bewilderment and perplexity, as from a
more ignoble source. Thus the earth arose from her state of stupor; water from the agitation
caused by her fear; air from the consolidation of her grief; while fire, producing death and
corruption, was inherent in all these elements, even as they teach that ignorance also lay
concealed in these three passions.</p>
<p>5. Having thus formed the world, he (the Demiurge) also created the earthy [part of]
man, not taking him from this dry earth, but from an invisible substance consisting of fusible
and fluid matter, and then afterwards, as they define the process, breathed into him the animal
part of his nature. It was this latter which was created after his image and likeness. The
material part, indeed, was very near to God, so far as the image went, but not of the same
substance with him. The animal, on the other hand, was so in respect to likeness; and hence
his substance was called the spirit of life, because it took its rise from a spiritual outflowing.
After all this, he was, they say, enveloped all round with a covering of skin; and by this they
mean the outward sensitive flesh.</p>
<p>6. But they further affirm that the Demiurge himself was ignorant of that offspring of
his mother Achamoth, which she brought forth as a consequence of her contemplation of
those angels who waited on the Saviour, and which was, like herself, of a spiritual nature.
She took advantage of this ignorance to deposit it (her production) in him without his
knowledge, in order that, being by his instrumentality infused into that animal soul proceeding
from himself, and being thus carried as in a womb in this material body, while it
gradually increased in strength, might in course of time become fitted for the reception of
perfect rationality.85 Thus it came to pass, then, according to them, that, without any
knowledge on the part of the Demiurge, the man formed by his inspiration was at the same
time, through an unspeakable providence, rendered a spiritual man by the simultaneous
inspiration received from Sophia. For, as he was ignorant of his mother, so neither did he
recognise her offspring. This [offspring] they also declare to be the Ecclesia, an emblem of
the Ecclesia which is above. This, then, is the kind of man whom they conceive of: he has
his animal soul from the Demiurge, his body from the earth, his fleshy part from matter,
and his spiritual man from the mother Achamoth.</p>
<note type="footnote">85 An account is here given of the infusion of a spiritual principle into mankind. The Demiurge himself could
give no more than the animal soul; but, unwittingly to himself, he was made the instrument of conveying that
spiritual essence from Achamoth, which had grown up within her from the contemplation of those angels who
accompanied the Saviour.</note>

<head>Chapter VI.—The threefold kind of man feigned by these heretics: good works
needless for them, though necessary to others: their abandoned morals.</head>
<p>1. There being thus three kinds of substances, they declare of all that is material (which
they also describe as being “on the left hand”) that it must of necessity perish, inasmuch as
it is incapable of receiving any afflatus of incorruption. As to every animal existence (which
they also denominate “on the right hand”), they hold that, inasmuch as it is a mean between
the spiritual and the material, it passes to the side to which inclination draws it. Spiritual
substance, again, they describe as having been sent forth for this end, that, being here united
with that which is animal, it might assume shape, the two elements being simultaneously
subjected to the same discipline. And this they declare to be “the salt”86 and “the light of
the world.” For the animal substance had need of training by means of the outward senses;
and on this account they affirm that the world was created, as well as that the Saviour came
to the animal substance (which was possessed of free-will), that He might secure for it salvation.
For they affirm that He received the first-fruits of those whom He was to save [as
follows], from Achamoth that which was spiritual, while He was invested by the Demiurge
with the animal Christ, but was begirt87 by a [special] dispensation with a body endowed
with an animal nature, yet constructed with unspeakable skill, so that it might be visible and
tangible, and capable of enduring suffering. At the same time, they deny that He assumed
anything material [into His nature], since indeed matter is incapable of salvation. They
further hold that the consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual
has been formed and perfected by Gnosis (knowledge); and by this they mean spiritual men
who have attained to the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries
by Achamoth. And they represent themselves to be these persons.</p>
<p>2. Animal men, again, are instructed in animal things; such men, namely, as are established
by their works, and by a mere faith, while they have not perfect knowledge. We of
the Church, they say, are these persons.88 Wherefore also they maintain that good works
are necessary to us, for that otherwise it is impossible we should be saved. But as to themselves,
they hold that they shall be entirely and undoubtedly saved, not by means of conduct,
but because they are spiritual by nature.89 For, just as it is impossible that material substance
should partake of salvation (since, indeed, they maintain that it is incapable of receiving it),
so again it is impossible that spiritual substance (by which they mean themselves) should

For even as gold, when submersed in filth, loses not on that account its beauty, but retains
its own native qualities, the filth having no power to injure the gold, so they affirm that they
cannot in any measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual substance, whatever the material
actions in which they may be involved.</p>

without fear to all those kinds of forbidden deeds of which the Scriptures assure us that
“they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”90 For instance, they make
no scruple about eating meats offered in sacrifice to idols, imagining that they can in this
way contract no defilement. Then, again, at every heathen festival celebrated in honour of
the idols, these men are the first to assemble; and to such a pitch do they go, that some of
them do not even keep away from that bloody spectacle hateful both to God and men, in
which gladiators either fight with wild beasts, or singly encounter one another. Others of
them yield themselves up to the lusts of the flesh with the utmost greediness, maintaining
that carnal things should be allowed to the carnal nature, while spiritual things are provided
for the spiritual. Some of them, moreover, are in the habit of defiling those women to whom
they have taught the above doctrine, as has frequently been confessed by those women who
have been led astray by certain of them, on their returning to the Church of God, and acknowledging
this along with the rest of their errors. Others of them, too, openly and without
a blush, having become passionately attached to certain women, seduce them away from
their husbands, and contract marriages of their own with them. Others of them, again, who
pretend at first to live in all modesty with them as with sisters, have in course of time been
revealed in their true colours, when the sister has been found with child by her [pretended]
brother.</p>
<p>4. And committing many other abominations and impieties, they run us down (who
from the fear of God guard against sinning even in thought or word) as utterly contemptible
and ignorant persons, while they highly exalt themselves, and claim to be perfect, and the
elect seed. For they declare that we simply receive grace for use, wherefore also it will again
be taken away from us; but that they themselves have grace as their own special possession,
which has descended from above by means of an unspeakable and indescribable conjunction;
and on this account more will be given them.91 They maintain, therefore, that in every way
it is always necessary for them to practise the mystery of conjunction. And that they may
persuade the thoughtless to believe this, they are in the habit of using these very words,

“Whosoever being in this world does not so love a woman as to obtain possession of her,
is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But whosoever being of92 this world has intercourse
with woman, shall not attain to the truth, because he has so acted under the power
of concupiscence.” On this account, they tell us that it is necessary for us whom they call
animal men, and describe as being of the world, to practise continence and good works,
that by this means we may attain at length to the intermediate habitation, but that to them
who are called “the spiritual and perfect” such a course of conduct is not at all necessary.
For it is not conduct of any kind which leads into the Pleroma, but the seed sent forth thence
in a feeble, immature state, and here brought to perfection.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The mother Achamoth, when all her seed are perfected, shall pass
into the Pleroma, accompanied by those men who are spiritual; the Demiurge,
with animal men, shall pass into the intermediate habitation; but all material
men shall go into corruption. Their blasphemous opinions against the true
incarnation of Christ by the Virgin Mary. Their views as to the prophecies. Stupid
ignorance of the Demiurge.</head>
<p>1. When all the seed shall have come to perfection, they state that then their mother
Achamoth shall pass from the intermediate place, and enter in within the Pleroma, and shall
receive as her spouse the Saviour, who sprang from all the Æons, that thus a conjunction
may be formed between the Saviour and Sophia, that is, Achamoth. These, then, are the
bridegroom and bride, while the nuptial chamber is the full extent of the Pleroma. The
spiritual seed, again, being divested of their animal souls,93 and becoming intelligent spirits,
shall in an irresistible and invisible manner enter in within the Pleroma, and be bestowed
as brides on those angels who wait upon the Saviour. The Demiurge himself will pass into
the place of his mother Sophia;94 that is, the intermediate habitation. In this intermediate
place, also, shall the souls of the righteous repose; but nothing of an animal nature shall find
admittance to the Pleroma. When these things have taken place as described, then shall that
fire which lies hidden in the world blaze forth and burn; and while destroying all matter,
shall also be extinguished along with it, and have no further existence. They affirm that the
Demiurge was acquainted with none of these things before the advent of the Saviour.</p>
<p>2. There are also some who maintain that he also produced Christ as his own proper
son, but of an animal nature, and that mention was95 made of him by the prophets. This
Christ passed through Mary96 just as water flows through a tube; and there descended upon
him in the form of a dove at the time of his baptism, that Saviour who belonged to the
Pleroma, and was formed by the combined efforts of all its inhabitants. In him there existed
also that spiritual seed which proceeded from Achamoth. They hold, accordingly, that our
Lord, while preserving the type of the first-begotten and primary tetrad, was compounded
of these four substances,—of that which is spiritual, in so far as He was from Achamoth; of
that which is animal, as being from the Demiurge by a special dispensation, inasmuch as
He was formed [corporeally] with unspeakable skill; and of the Saviour, as respects that

dove which descended upon Him. He also continued free from all suffering, since indeed
it was not possible that He should suffer who was at once incomprehensible and invisible.
And for this reason the Spirit of Christ, who had been placed within Him, was taken away
when He was brought before Pilate. They maintain, further, that not even the seed which
He had received from the mother [Achamoth] was subject to suffering; for it, too, was impassible,
as being spiritual, and invisible even to the Demiurge himself. It follows, then, according
to them, that the animal Christ, and that which had been formed mysteriously by
a special dispensation, underwent suffering, that the mother might exhibit through him a
type of the Christ above, namely, of him who extended himself through Stauros,97 and imparted
to Achamoth shape, so far as substance was concerned. For they declare that all these
transactions were counterparts of what took place above.</p>
<p>3. They maintain, moreover, that those souls which possess the seed of Achamoth are
superior to the rest, and are more dearly loved by the Demiurge than others, while he knows
not the true cause thereof, but imagines that they are what they are through his favour towards
them. Wherefore, also, they say he distributed them to prophets, priests, and kings;
and they declare that many things were spoken98 by this seed through the prophets, inasmuch
as it was endowed with a transcendently lofty nature. The mother also, they say, spake much
about things above, and that both through him and through the souls which were formed
by him. Then, again, they divide the prophecies [into different classes], maintaining that
one portion was uttered by the mother, a second by her seed, and a third by the Demiurge.
In like manner, they hold that Jesus uttered some things under the influence of the Saviour,
others under that of the mother, and others still under that of the Demiurge, as we shall
show further on in our work.</p>
<p>4. The Demiurge, while ignorant of those things which were higher than himself, was
indeed excited by the announcements made [through the prophets], but treated them with
contempt, attributing them sometimes to one cause and sometimes to another; either to the
prophetic spirit (which itself possesses the power of self-excitement), or to [mere unassisted]
man, or that it was simply a crafty device of the lower [and baser order of men].99 He remained
thus ignorant until the appearing of the Lord. But they relate that when the Saviour
came, the Demiurge learned all things from Him, and gladly with all his power joined
<note type="footnote">97 By thus extending himself through Stauros, who bounded the Pleroma, the Christ above became the type

seed.”</note>
<note type="footnote">99 Such appears to be the meaning of this sentence, but the original is very obscure. The writer seems to refer
to the spiritual, the animal, and the material classes of men, and to imply that the Demiurge supposed some
prophecies to be due to one of these classes, and some to the others.</note>

himself to Him. They maintain that he is the centurion mentioned in the Gospel, who addressed
the Saviour in these words: “For I also am one having soldiers and servants under
my authority; and whatsoever I command they do.”100 They further hold that he will continue
administering the affairs of the world as long as that is fitting and needful, and specially
that he may exercise a care over the Church; while at the same time he is influenced by the
knowledge of the reward prepared for him, namely, that he may attain to the habitation of
his mother.</p>
<p>5. They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal, represented
by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person,101 but
constitute various kinds [of men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption.
The animal, if it make choice of the better part, finds repose in the intermediate place; but
if the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. But they assert that the spiritual principles
which have been sown by Achamoth, being disciplined and nourished here from that time
until now in righteous souls (because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at
last attaining to perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the Saviour, while their
animal souls of necessity rest for ever with the Demiurge in the intermediate place. And
again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say that some are by nature good, and
others by nature evil. The good are those who become capable of receiving the [spiritual]
seed; the evil by nature are those who are never able to receive that seed.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—How the Valentinians pervert the Scriptures to support their
own pious opinions.</head>
<p>1. Such, then, is their system, which neither the prophets announced, nor the Lord
taught, nor the apostles delivered, but of which they boast that beyond all others they have
a perfect knowledge. They gather their views from other sources than the Scriptures;102 and,
to use a common proverb, they strive to weave ropes of sand, while they endeavour to adapt
with an air of probability to their own peculiar assertions the parables of the Lord, the sayings
of the prophets, and the words of the apostles, in order that their scheme may not seem altogether
without support. In doing so, however, they disregard the order and the connection
of the Scriptures, and so far as in them lies, dismember and destroy the truth. By transferring
passages, and dressing them up anew, and making one thing out of another, they succeed
in deluding many through their wicked art in adapting the oracles of the Lord to their
opinions. Their manner of acting is just as if one, when a beautiful image of a king has been
constructed by some skilful artist out of precious jewels, should then take this likeness of
the man all to pieces, should rearrange the gems, and so fit them together as to make them
into the form of a dog or of a fox, and even that but poorly executed; and should then
maintain and declare that this was the beautiful image of the king which the skilful artist
constructed, pointing to the jewels which had been admirably fitted together by the first
artist to form the image of the king, but have been with bad effect transferred by the latter
one to the shape of a dog, and by thus exhibiting the jewels, should deceive the ignorant
who had no conception what a king’s form was like, and persuade them that that miserable
likeness of the fox was, in fact, the beautiful image of the king. In like manner do these
persons patch together old wives’ fables, and then endeavour, by violently drawing away
from their proper connection, words, expressions, and parables whenever found, to adapt
the oracles of God to their baseless fictions. We have already stated how far they proceed
in this way with respect to the interior of the Pleroma.</p>
<p>2. Then, again, as to those things outside of their Pleroma, the following are some specimens
of what they attempt to accommodate out of the Scriptures to their opinions. They
affirm that the Lord came in the last times of the world to endure suffering, for this end,
that He might indicate the passion which occurred to the last of the Æons, and might by
His own end announce the cessation of that disturbance which had risen among the Æons.
They maintain, further, that that girl of twelve years old, the daughter of the ruler of the
synagogue,103 to whom the Lord approached and raised her from the dead, was a type of
Achamoth, to whom their Christ, by extending himself, imparted shape, and whom he led
anew to the perception of that light which had forsaken her. And that the Saviour appeared
<note type="footnote">102 Literally, “reading from things unwritten.”</note>
<note type="footnote">103 Luke viii. 41.</note>

<pb n="869"/>
to her when she lay outside of the Pleroma as a kind of abortion, they affirm Paul to have
declared in his Epistle to the Corinthians [in these words], “And last of all, He appeared to
me also, as to one born out of due time.”104 Again, the coming of the Saviour with His attendants
to Achamoth is declared in like manner by him in the same Epistle, when he says,
“A woman ought to have a veil upon her head, because of the angels.”105 Now, that
Achamoth, when the Saviour came to her, drew a veil over herself through modesty, Moses
rendered manifest when he put a veil upon his face. Then, also, they say that the passions
which she endured were indicated by the Lord upon the cross. Thus, when He said, “My
God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”106 He simply showed that Sophia was deserted
by the light, and was restrained by Horos from making any advance forward. Her anguish,
again, was indicated when He said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;”107
her fear by the words, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me;”108 and her perplexity,
too, when He said, “And what I shall say, I know not.”109</p>
<p>3. And they teach that He pointed out the three kinds of men as follows: the material,
when He said to him that asked Him, “Shall I follow Thee?”110 “The Son of man hath not
where to lay His head;”— the animal, when He said to him that declared, “I will follow Thee,
but suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house,” “No man, putting his hand
to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven”111 (for this man they declare
to be of the intermediate class, even as they do that other who, though he professed to
have wrought a large amount of righteousness, yet refused to follow Him, and was so overcome
by [the love of] riches, as never to reach perfection)—this one it pleases them to place
in the animal class;—the spiritual, again, when He said, “Let the dead bury their dead, but
go thou and preach the kingdom of God,”112 and when He said to Zaccheus the publican,
“Make haste, and come down, for to-day I must abide in thine house”113—for these they
declared to have belonged to the spiritual class. Also the parable of the leaven which the
woman is described as having hid in three measures of meal, they declare to make manifest

the three classes. For, according to their teaching, the woman represented Sophia; the three
measures of meal, the three kinds of men— spiritual, animal, and material; while the leaven
denoted the Saviour Himself. Paul, too, very plainly set forth the material, animal, and
spiritual, saying in one place, “As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;”114 and
in another place, “But the animal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit;”115 and again:
“He that is spiritual judgeth all things.”116 And this, “The animal man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit,” they affirm to have been spoken concerning the Demiurge, who, as
being animal, knew neither his mother who was spiritual, nor her seed, nor the Æons in the
Pleroma. And that the Saviour received first-fruits of those whom He was to save, Paul declared
when he said, “And if the first-fruits be holy, the lump is also holy,”117 teaching that
the expression “first-fruits” denoted that which is spiritual, but that “the lump” meant us,
that is, the animal Church, the lump of which they say He assumed, and blended it with
Himself, inasmuch as He is “the leaven.”</p>
<p>4. Moreover, that Achamoth wandered beyond the Pleroma, and received form from
Christ, and was sought after by the Saviour, they declare that He indicated when He said,
that He had come after that sheep which was gone astray.118 For they explain the wandering
sheep to mean their mother, by whom they represent the Church as having been sown. The
wandering itself denotes her stay outside of the Pleroma in a state of varied passion, from
which they maintain that matter derived its origin. The woman, again, who sweeps the house
and finds the piece of money, they declare to denote the Sophia above, who, having lost her
enthymesis, afterwards recovered it, on all things being purified by the advent of the Saviour.
Wherefore this substance also, according to them, was reinstated in Pleroma. They say, too,
that Simeon, “who took Christ into his arms, and gave thanks to God, and said, Lord, now
lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word,”119 was a type of the
Demiurge, who, on the arrival of the Saviour, learned his own change of place, and gave
thanks to Bythus. They also assert that by Anna, who is spoken of in the gospel120 as a
prophetess, and who, after living seven years with her husband, passed all the rest of her life
in widowhood until she saw the Saviour, and recognised Him, and spoke of Him to all, was
most plainly indicated Achamoth, who, having for a little while looked upon the Saviour
with His associates, and dwelling all the rest of the time in the intermediate place, waited

for Him till He should come again, and restore her to her proper consort. Her name, too,
was indicated by the Saviour, when He said, “Yet wisdom is justified by her children.”121
This, too, was done by Paul in these words, “But we speak wisdom among them that are
perfect.”122 They declare also that Paul has referred to the conjunctions within the Pleroma,
showing them forth by means of one; for, when writing of the conjugal union in this life,
he expressed himself thus: “This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.”123</p>
<p>5. Further, they teach that John, the disciple of the Lord, indicated the first Ogdoad,
expressing themselves in these words: John, the disciple of the Lord, wishing to set forth the
origin of all things, so as to explain how the Father produced the whole, lays down a certain
principle,—that, namely, which was first-begotten by God, which Being he has termed both
the only-begotten Son and God, in whom the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth
all things. By him the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance of the Æons, to
which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since, therefore, he treats of the first
origin of things, he rightly proceeds in his teaching from the beginning, that is, from God
and the Word. And he expresses himself thus: “In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God.”124
Having first of all distinguished these three—God, the Beginning, and the Word —he again
unites them, that he may exhibit the production of each of them, that is, of the Son and of
the Word, and may at the same time show their union with one another, and with the
Father. For “the beginning” is in the Father, and of the Father, while “the Word” is in the
beginning, and of the beginning. Very properly, then, did he say, “In the beginning was the
Word,” for He was in the Son; “and the Word was with God,” for He was the beginning;
“and the Word was God,” of course, for that which is begotten of God is God. “The same
was in the beginning with God”—this clause discloses the order of production. “All things
were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made;”125 for the Word was the author
of form and beginning to all the Æons that came into existence after Him. But “what was
made in Him,” says John, “is life.”126 Here again he indicated conjunction; for all things,
he said, were made by Him, but in Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely
connected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for it exists along

with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds, “And the life was the light of
men,” while thus mentioning Anthropos, he indicated also Ecclesia by that one expression,
in order that, by using only one name, he might disclose their fellowship with one another,
in virtue of their conjunction. For Anthropos and Ecclesia spring from Logos and Zoe.
Moreover, he styled life (Zoe) the light of men, because they are enlightened by her, that is,
formed and made manifest. This also Paul declares in these words: “For whatsoever doth
make manifest is light.”127 Since, therefore, Zoe manifested and begat both Anthropos and
Ecclesia, she is termed their light. Thus, then, did John by these words reveal both other
things and the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. And still further, he
also indicated the first Tetrad. For, in discoursing of the Saviour and declaring that all things
beyond the Pleroma received form from Him, he says that He is the fruit of the entire Pleroma.
For he styles Him a “light which shineth in darkness, and which was not comprehended”
128 by it, inasmuch as, when He imparted form to all those things which had their origin
from passion, He was not known by it.129 He also styles Him Son, and Aletheia, and Zoe,
and the “Word made flesh, whose glory,” he says, “we beheld; and His glory was as that of
the Only-begotten (given to Him by the Father), full of grace and truth.”130 (But what John
really does say is this: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld
His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”131) Thus,
then, does he [according to them] distinctly set forth the first Tetrad, when he speaks of the
Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia. In this way, too, does John tell of the first
Ogdoad, and that which is the mother of all the Æons. For he mentions the Father, and
Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia.

<head>Chapter IX.—Refutation of the impious interpretations of these heretics.</head>
<p>1. You see, my friend, the method which these men employ to deceive themselves, while
they abuse the Scriptures by endeavouring to support their own system out of them. For
this reason, I have brought forward their modes of expressing themselves, that thus thou
mightest understand the deceitfulness of their procedure, and the wickedness of their error.
For, in the first place, if it had been John’s intention to set forth that Ogdoad above, he would
surely have preserved the order of its production, and would doubtless have placed the
primary Tetrad first as being, according to them, most venerable and would then have annexed
the second, that, by the sequence of the names, the order of the Ogdoad might be
exhibited, and not after so long an interval, as if forgetful for the moment and then again
calling the matter to mind, he, last of all, made mention of the primary Tetrad. In the next
place, if he had meant to indicate their conjunctions, he certainly would not have omitted
the name of Ecclesia; while, with respect to the other conjunctions, he either would have
been satisfied with the mention of the male [Æons] (since the others [like Ecclesia] might
be understood), so as to preserve a uniformity throughout; or if he enumerated the conjunctions
of the rest, he would also have announced the spouse of Anthropos, and would not
have left us to find out her name by divination.</p>
<p>2. The fallacy, then, of this exposition is manifest. For when John, proclaiming one God,
the Almighty, and one Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten, by whom all things were made, declares
that this was the Son of God, this the Only-begotten, this the Former of all things,
this the true Light who enlighteneth every man, this the Creator of the world, this He that
came to His own, this He that became flesh and dwelt among us,—these men, by a plausible
kind of exposition, perverting these statements, maintain that there was another Monogenes,
according to production, whom they also style Arche. They also maintain that there was
another Saviour, and another Logos, the son of Monogenes, and another Christ produced
for the re-establishment of the Pleroma. Thus it is that, wresting from the truth every one
of the expressions which have been cited, and taking a bad advantage of the names, they
have transferred them to their own system; so that, according to them, in all these terms
John makes no mention of the Lord Jesus Christ. For if he has named the Father, and
Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia,
according to their hypothesis, he has, by thus speaking, referred to the primary Ogdoad, in
which there was as yet no Jesus, and no Christ, the teacher of John. But that the apostle did
not speak concerning their conjunctions, but concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he
also acknowledges as the Word of God, he himself has made evident. For, summing up his
statements respecting the Word previously mentioned by him, he further declares, “And
the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” But, according to their hypothesis, the
Word did not become flesh at all, inasmuch as He never went outside of the Pleroma, but

that Saviour [became flesh] who was formed by a special dispensation [out of all the Æons],
and was of later date than the Word.</p>
<p>3. Learn then, ye foolish men, that Jesus who suffered for us, and who dwelt among us,
is Himself the Word of God. For if any other of the Æons had become flesh for our salvation,
it would have been probable that the apostle spoke of another. But if the Word of the Father
who descended is the same also that ascended, He, namely, the Only-begotten Son of the
only God, who, according to the good pleasure of the Father, became flesh for the sake of
men, the apostle certainly does not speak regarding any other, or concerning any Ogdoad,
but respecting our Lord Jesus Christ. For, according to them, the Word did not originally
become flesh. For they maintain that the Saviour assumed an animal body, formed in accordance
with a special dispensation by an unspeakable providence, so as to become visible
and palpable. But flesh is that which was of old formed for Adam by God out of the dust,
and it is this that John has declared the Word of God became. Thus is their primary and
first-begotten Ogdoad brought to nought. For, since Logos, and Monogenes, and Zoe, and
Phōs, and Soter, and Christus, and the Son of God, and He who became incarnate for us,
have been proved to be one and the same, the Ogdoad which they have built up at once falls
to pieces. And when this is destroyed, their whole system sinks into ruin,—a system which
they falsely dream into existence, and thus inflict injury on the Scriptures, while they build
up their own hypothesis.</p>
<p>4. Then, again, collecting a set of expressions and names scattered here and there [in
Scripture], they twist them, as we have already said, from a natural to a non-natural sense.
In so doing, they act like those who bring forward any kind of hypothesis they fancy, and
then endeavour to support133 them out of the poems of Homer, so that the ignorant imagine
that Homer actually composed the verses bearing upon that hypothesis, which has, in fact,
been but newly constructed; and many others are led so far by the regularly-formed sequence
of the verses, as to doubt whether Homer may not have composed them. Of this kind134 is
the following passage, where one, describing Hercules as having been sent by Eurystheus
to the dog in the infernal regions, does so by means of these Homeric verses,—for there can
be no objection to our citing these by way of illustration, since the same sort of attempt appears
in both:—</p>
<p>““Thus saying, there sent forth from his house deeply groaning.”—Od., x. 76.
“The hero Hercules conversant with mighty deeds.”—Od., xxi. 26.
“Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelus, descended from Perseus.”—Il., xix. 123.
<note type="footnote">133 It is difficult to give an exact rendering of μελετᾶν in this passage; the old Lat. version translates it by
meditari, which Massuet proposes to render “skilfully to fit.”</note>
<note type="footnote">134 Tertullian refers (Præscrip. Hær.) to those Homeric centos of which a specimen follows. We have given
each line as it stands in the original: the text followed by Irenæus differs slightly from the received text.</note>

<pb n="875"/>
“That he might bring from Erebus the dog of gloomy Pluto.”—Il., viii. 368.
“And he advanced like a mountain-bred lion confident of strength.”—Od., vi. 130.
“Rapidly through the city, while all his friends followed.” —Il., xxiv. 327.
“Both maidens, and youths, and much-enduring old men.”—Od., xi. 38.
“Mourning for him bitterly as one going forward to death.” —Il., xxiv. 328.
“But Mercury and the blue-eyed Minerva conducted him.”—Od., xi. 626.
“For she knew the mind of her brother, how it laboured with grief.”—Il., ii. 409.”</p>
<p>Now, what simple-minded man, I ask, would not be led away by such verses as these to
think that Homer actually framed them so with reference to the subject indicated? But he
who is acquainted with the Homeric writings will recognise the verses indeed, but not the
subject to which they are applied, as knowing that some of them were spoken of Ulysses,
others of Hercules himself, others still of Priam, and others again of Menelaus and
Agamemnon. But if he takes them and restores each of them to its proper position, he at
once destroys the narrative in question. In like manner he also who retains unchangeable135
in his heart the rule of the truth which he received by means of baptism, will doubtless recognise
the names, the expressions, and the parables taken from the Scriptures, but will by
no means acknowledge the blasphemous use which these men make of them. For, though
he will acknowledge the gems, he will certainly not receive the fox instead of the likeness of
the king. But when he has restored every one of the expressions quoted to its proper position,
and has fitted it to the body of the truth, he will lay bare, and prove to be without any
foundation, the figment of these heretics.</p>
<p>5. But since what may prove a finishing-stroke136 to this exhibition is wanting, so that
any one, on following out their farce to the end, may then at once append an argument
which shall overthrow it, we have judged it well to point out, first of all, in what respects the
very fathers of this fable differ among themselves, as if they were inspired by different spirits
of error. For this very fact forms an a priori proof that the truth proclaimed by the Church
is immoveable,137 and that the theories of these men are but a tissue of falsehoods.

<head>Chapter X.—Unity of the faith of the Church throughout the whole world.</head>
<p>1. The Church, though dispersed through our the whole world, even to the ends of the
earth, has received from the apostles and their disciples this faith: [She believes] in one God,
the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in
them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who became incarnate for our salvation; and
in the Holy Spirit, who proclaimed through the prophets the dispensations138of God, and
the advents, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the
dead, and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved Christ Jesus, our Lord, and
His [future] manifestation from heaven in the glory of the Father “to gather all things in
one,”139 and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human race, in order that to Christ Jesus,
our Lord, and God, and Saviour, and King, according to the will of the invisible Father,
“every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,
and that every tongue should confess”140 to Him, and that He should execute just judgment
towards all; that He may send “spiritual wickednesses,”141 and the angels who transgressed
and became apostates, together with the ungodly, and unrighteous, and wicked, and profane
among men, into everlasting fire; but may, in the exercise of His grace, confer immortality
on the righteous, and holy, and those who have kept His commandments, and have persevered
in His love, some from the beginning [of their Christian course], and others from
[the date of] their repentance, and may surround them with everlasting glory.</p>
<p>2. As I have already observed, the Church, having received this preaching and this faith,
although scattered throughout the whole world, yet, as if occupying but one house, carefully
preserves it. She also believes these points [of doctrine] just as if she had but one soul, and
one and the same heart, and she proclaims them, and teaches them, and hands them down,
with perfect harmony, as if she possessed only one mouth. For, although the languages of
the world are dissimilar, yet the import of the tradition is one and the same. For the Churches
which have been planted in Germany do not believe or hand down anything different, nor
do those in Spain, nor those in Gaul, nor those in the East, nor those in Egypt, nor those in
Libya, nor those which have been established in the central regions142 of the world. But as
the sun, that creature of God, is one and the same throughout the whole world, so also the
preaching of the truth shineth everywhere, and enlightens all men that are willing to come
to a knowledge of the truth. Nor will any one of the rulers in the Churches, however highly
gifted he may be in point of eloquence, teach doctrines different from these (for no one is

greater than the Master); nor, on the other hand, will he who is deficient in power of expression
inflict injury on the tradition. For the faith being ever one and the same, neither does
one who is able at great length to discourse regarding it, make any addition to it, nor does
one, who can say but little diminish it.</p>
<p>3. It does not follow because men are endowed with greater and less degrees of intelligence,
that they should therefore change the subject-matter [of the faith] itself, and should
conceive of some other God besides Him who is the Framer, Maker, and Preserver of this
universe, (as if He were not sufficient143 for them), or of another Christ, or another Onlybegotten.
But the fact referred to simply implies this, that one may [more accurately than
another] bring out the meaning of those things which have been spoken in parables, and
accommodate them to the general scheme of the faith; and explain [with special clearness]
the operation and dispensation of God connected with human salvation; and show that God
manifested longsuffering in regard to the apostasy of the angels who transgressed, as also
with respect to the disobedience of men; and set forth why it is that one and the same God
has made some things temporal and some eternal, some heavenly and others earthly; and
understand for what reason God, though invisible, manifested Himself to the prophets not
under one form, but differently to different individuals; and show why it was that more
covenants than one were given to mankind; and teach what was the special character of
each of these covenants; and search out for what reason “God144 hath concluded every
man145 in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all;” and gratefully146 describe on what
account the Word of God became flesh and suffered; and relate why the advent of the Son
of God took place in these last times, that is, in the end, rather than in the beginning [of the
world]; and unfold what is contained in the Scriptures concerning the end [itself], and things
to come; and not be silent as to how it is that God has made the Gentiles, whose salvation
was despaired of, fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with the saints; and
discourse how it is that “this mortal body shall put on immortality, and this corruptible shall
put on incorruption;”147 and proclaim in what sense [God] says, “That is a people who was
not a people; and she is beloved who was not beloved;”148 and in what sense He says that
“more are the children of her that was desolate, than of her who possessed a husband.”149

For in reference to these points, and others of a like nature, the apostle exclaims: “Oh! the
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out!”150 But [the superior skill spoken of] is not found
in this, that any one should, beyond the Creator and Framer [of the world], conceive of the
Enthymesis of an erring Æon, their mother and his, and should thus proceed to such a pitch
of blasphemy; nor does it consist in this, that he should again falsely imagine, as being above
this [fancied being], a Pleroma at one time supposed to contain thirty, and at another time
an innumerable tribe of Æons, as these teachers who are destitute of truly divine wisdom
maintain; while the Catholic Church possesses one and the same faith throughout the whole
world, as we have already said.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The opinions of Valentinus, with those of his disciples and others.</head>
<p>1. Let us now look at the inconsistent opinions of those heretics (for there are some
two or three of them), how they do not agree in treating the same points, but alike, in things
and names, set forth opinions mutually discordant. The first151 of them, Valentinus, who
adapted the principles of the heresy called “Gnostic” to the peculiar character of his own
school, taught as follows: He maintained that there is a certain Dyad (twofold being), who
is inexpressible by any name, of whom one part should be called Arrhetus (unspeakable),
and the other Sige (silence). But of this Dyad a second was produced, one part of whom he
names Pater, and the other Aletheia. From this Tetrad, again, arose Logos and Zoe, Anthropos
and Ecclesia. These constitute the primary Ogdoad. He next states that from Logos and Zoe
ten powers were produced, as we have before mentioned. But from Anthropos and Ecclesia
proceeded twelve, one of which separating from the rest, and falling from its original condition,
produced the rest152 of the universe. He also supposed two beings of the name of
Horos, the one of whom has his place between Bythus and the rest of the Pleroma, and divides
the created Æons from the uncreated Father, while the other separates their mother from
the Pleroma. Christ also was not produced from the Æons within the Pleroma, but was
brought forth by the mother who had been excluded from it, in virtue of her remembrance
of better things, but not without a kind of shadow. He, indeed, as being masculine, having
severed the shadow from himself, returned to the Pleroma; but his mother being left with
the shadow, and deprived of her spiritual substance, brought forth another son, namely, the
Demiurge, whom he also styles the supreme ruler of all those things which are subject to
him. He also asserts that, along with the Demiurge, there was produced a left-hand power,
in which particular he agrees with those falsely called Gnostics, of whom to we have yet to
speak. Sometimes, again, he maintains that Jesus was produced from him who was separated
from their mother, and united to the rest, that is, from Theletus, sometimes as springing
from him who returned into the Pleroma, that is, from Christ; and at other times still as
derived from Anthropos and Ecclesia. And he declares that the Holy Spirit was produced
by Aletheia153 for the inspection and fructification of the Æons, by entering invisibly into
them, and that, in this way, the Æons brought forth the plants of truth.</p>
<p>2. Secundus again affirms that the primary Ogdoad consists of a right hand and a left
hand Tetrad, and teaches that the one of these is called light, and the other darkness. But
he maintains that the power which separated from the rest, and fell away, did not proceed
directly from the thirty Æons, but from their fruits.</p>
<note type="footnote">151 That is, the first of the two or three here referred to, not the first of the Gnostic teachers, as some have
imagined. [The Gnosticism of one age may be essentially the same in spirit as the Agnosticism of another.]</note>

<pb n="880"/>
<p>3. There is another,154 who is a renowned teacher among them, and who, struggling to
reach something more sublime, and to attain to a kind of higher knowledge, has explained
the primary Tetrad as follows: There is [he says] a certain Proarche who existed before all
things, surpassing all thought, speech, and nomenclature, whom I call Monotes (unity).
Together with this Monotes there exists a power, which again I term Henotes (oneness).
This Henotes and Monotes, being one, produced, yet not so as to bring forth [apart from
themselves, as an emanation] the beginning of all things, an intelligent, unbegotten, and
invisible being, which beginning language terms “Monad.” With this Monad there co-exists
a power of the same essence, which again I term Hen (One). These powers then— Monotes,
and Henotes, and Monas, and Hen—produced the remaining company of the Æons.</p>
<p>4. Iu, Iu! Pheu, Pheu!—for well may we utter these tragic exclamations at such a pitch
of audacity in the coining of names as he has displayed without a blush, in devising a nomenclature
for his system of falsehood. For when he declares: There is a certain Proarche
before all things, surpassing all thought, whom I call Monotes; and again, with this Monotes
there co-exists a power which I also call Henotes,—it is most manifest that he confesses the
things which have been said to be his own invention, and that he himself has given names
to his scheme of things, which had never been previously suggested by any other. It is
manifest also, that he himself is the one who has had sufficient audacity to coin these names;
so that, unless he had appeared in the world, the truth would still have been destitute of a
name. But, in that case, nothing hinders any other, in dealing with the same subject, to affix
names after such a fashion as the following: There155 is a certain Proarche, royal, surpassing
all thought, a power existing before every other substance, and extended into space in every
direction. But along with it there exists a power which I term a Gourd; and along with this
Gourd there exists a power which again I term Utter-Emptiness. This Gourd and Emptiness,
since they are one, produced (and yet did not simply produce, so as to be apart from themselves)
a fruit, everywhere visible, eatable, and delicious, which fruit-language calls a Cucumber.
Along with this Cucumber exists a power of the same essence, which again I call a
Melon. These powers, the Gourd, Utter-Emptiness, the Cucumber, and the Melon, brought
forth the remaining multitude of the delirious melons of Valentinus.156 For if it is fitting
that that language which is used respecting the universe be transformed to the primary
Tetrad, and if any one may assign names at his pleasure, who shall prevent us from adopting

these names, as being much more credible [than the others], as well as in general use, and
understood by all?</p>
<p>5. Others still, however, have called their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad by the
following names: first, Proarche; then Anennoetos; thirdly, Arrhetos; and fourthly, Aoratos.
Then, from the first, Proarche, there was produced, in the first and fifth place, Arche; from
Anennoetos, in the second and sixth place, Acataleptos; from Arrhetos, in the third and
seventh place, Anonomastos; and from Aoratos, in the fourth and eighth place, Agennetos.
This is the Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. They maintain that these powers were anterior to
Bythus and Sige, that they may appear more perfect than the perfect, and more knowing
than the very Gnostics! To these persons one may justly exclaim: “O ye trifling sophists!”
since, even respecting Bythus himself, there are among them many and discordant opinions.
For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact,
nothing at all; while others affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature
of a hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed
the first conjunction.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The doctrines of the followers of Ptolemy and Colorbasus.</head>
<p>1. But the followers of Ptolemy say157 that he [Bythus] has two consorts, which they
also name Diatheses (affections), viz., Ennoea and Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first conceived
the thought of producing something, and then willed to that effect. Wherefore, again,
these two affections, or powers, Ennoea and Thelesis, having intercourse, as it were, between
themselves, the production of Monogenes and Aletheia took place according to conjunction.
These two came forth as types and images of the two affections of the Father,—visible representations
of those that were invisible,—Nous (i.e., Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia
of Ennoea, and accordingly the image resulting from Thelesis was masculine,158 while that
from Ennoea was feminine. Thus Thelesis (will) became, as it were, a faculty of Ennoea
(thought). For Ennoea continually yearned after offspring; but she could not of herself bring
forth that which she desired. But when the power of Thelesis (the faculty of will) came upon
her, then she brought forth that on which she had brooded.</p>
<p>2. These fancied beings159 (like the Jove of Homer, who is represented160 as passing an
anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring Achilles and destroying numbers
of the Greeks) will not appear to you, my dear friend, to be possessed of greater knowledge
than He who is the God of the universe. He, as soon as He thinks, also performs what He
has willed; and as soon as He wills, also thinks that which He has willed; then thinking when
He wills, and then willing when He thinks, since He is all thought, [all will, all mind, all
light,]161 all eye, all ear, the one entire fountain of all good things.</p>
<p>3. Those of them, however, who are deemed more skilful than the persons who have
just been mentioned, say that the first Ogdoad was not produced gradually, so that one Æon
was sent forth by another, but that all162 the Æons were brought into existence at once by
Propator and his Ennoea. He (Colorbasus) affirms this as confidently as if he had assisted
at their birth. Accordingly, he and his followers maintain that Anthropos and Ecclesia were
not produced,163 as others hold, from Logos and Zoe; but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe
from Anthropos and Ecclesia. But they express this in another form, as follows: When the
Propator conceived the thought of producing something, he received the name of Father.

But because what he did produce was true, it was named Aletheia. Again, when he wished
to reveal himself, this was termed Anthropos. Finally, when he produced those whom he
had previously thought of, these were named Ecclesia. Anthropos, by speaking, formed
Logos: this is the first-born son. But Zoe followed upon Logos; and thus the first Ogdoad
was completed.</p>
<p>4. They have much contention also among themselves respecting the Saviour. For some
maintain that he was formed out of all; wherefore also he was called Eudocetos, because the
whole Pleroma was well pleased through him to glorify the Father. But others assert that he
was produced from those ten Æons alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe, and that on this
account he was called Logos and Zoe, thus preserving the ancestral names.164 Others, again,
affirm that he had his being from those twelve Æons who were the offspring of Anthropos
and Ecclesia; and on this account he acknowledges himself the Son of man, as being a descendant
of Anthropos. Others still, assert that he was produced by Christ and the Holy
Spirit, who were brought forth for the security of the Pleroma; and that on this account he
was called Christ, thus preserving the appellation of the Father, by whom he was produced.
And there are yet others among them who declare that the Propator of the whole, Proarche,
and Proanennoetos is called Anthropos; and that this is the great and abstruse mystery,
namely, that the Power which is above all others, and contains all in his embrace, is termed
Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself the “Son of man.”</p>
<note type="footnote">164 Harvey justly remarks, that “one cause of perplexity in unravelling the Valentinian scheme is the recurrence
of similar names at different points of the system, e.g., the Enthymesis of Sophia was called Sophia and Spiritus;
and Pater, Arche, Monogenes, Christus, Anthropos, Ecclesia, were all of them terms of a double denomination.”</note>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The deceitful arts and nefarious practices of Marcus.</head>
<p>1. But165 there is another among these heretics, Marcus by name, who boasts himself
as having improved upon his master. He is a perfect adept in magical impostures, and by
this means drawing away a great number of men, and not a few women, he has induced
them to join themselves to him, as to one who is possessed of the greatest knowledge and
perfection, and who has received the highest power from the invisible and ineffable regions
above. Thus it appears as if he really were the precursor of Antichrist. For, joining the buffooneries
of Anaxilaus166 to the craftiness of the magi, as they are called, he is regarded by
his senseless and cracked-brain followers as working miracles by these means.</p>
<p>2. Pretending167 to consecrate cups mixed with wine, and protracting to great length
the word of invocation, he contrives to give them a purple and reddish colour, so that
Charis,168 who is one of those that are superior to all things, should be thought to drop her
own blood into that cup through means of his invocation, and that thus those who are
present should be led to rejoice to taste of that cup, in order that, by so doing, the Charis,
who is set forth by this magician, may also flow into them. Again, handing mixed cups to
the women, he bids them consecrate these in his presence. When this has been done, he
himself produces another cup of much larger size than that which the deluded woman has
consecrated, and pouring from the smaller one consecrated by the woman into that which
has been brought forward by himself, he at the same time pronounces these words: “May
that Charis who is before all things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill thine
inner man, and multiply in thee her own knowledge, by sowing the grain of mustard seed
in thee as in good soil.” Repeating certain other like words, and thus goading on the wretched
woman [to madness], he then appears a worker of wonders when the large cup is seen to
have been filled out of the small one, so as even to overflow by what has been obtained from
it. By accomplishing several other similar things, he has completely deceived many, and
drawn them away after him.</p>
<p>3. It appears probable enough that this man possesses a demon as his familiar spirit, by
means of whom he seems able to prophesy,169 and also enables as many as he counts worthy
to be partakers of his Charis themselves to prophesy. He devotes himself especially to women,
and those such as are well-bred, and elegantly attired, and of great wealth, whom he frequently
seeks to draw after him, by addressing them in such seductive words as these: “I am eager

to make thee a partaker of my Charis, since the Father of all doth continually behold thy
angel before His face. Now the place of thy angel is among us:170 it behoves us to become
one. Receive first from me and by me [the gift of] Charis. Adorn thyself as a bride who is
expecting her bridegroom, that thou mayest be what I am, and I what thou art. Establish
the germ of light in thy nuptial chamber. Receive from me a spouse, and become receptive
of him, while thou art received by him. Behold Charis has descended upon thee; open thy
mouth and prophesy.” On the woman replying, “I have never at any time prophesied, nor
do I know how to prophesy;” then engaging, for the second time, in certain invocations, so
as to astound his deluded victim, he says to her, “Open thy mouth, speak whatsoever occurs
to thee, and thou shalt prophesy.” She then, vainly puffed up and elated by these words, and
greatly excited in soul by the expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy, her heart
beating violently [from emotion], reaches the requisite pitch of audacity, and idly as well as
impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her, such as might be expected
from one heated by an empty spirit. (Referring to this, one superior to me has observed,
that the soul is both audacious and impudent when heated with empty air.) Henceforth she
reckons herself a prophetess, and expresses her thanks to Marcus for having imparted to
her of his own Charis. She then makes the effort to reward him, not only by the gift of her
possessions (in which way he has collected a very large fortune), but also by yielding up to
him her person, desiring in every way to be united to him, that she may become altogether
one with him.</p>
<p>4. But already some of the most faithful women, possessed of the fear of God, and not
being deceived (whom, nevertheless, he did his best to seduce like the rest by bidding them
prophesy), abhorring and execrating him, have withdrawn from such a vile company of
revellers. This they have done, as being well aware that the gift of prophecy is not conferred
on men by Marcus, the magician, but that only those to whom God sends His grace from
above possess the divinely-bestowed power of prophesying; and then they speak where and
when God pleases, and not when Marcus orders them to do so. For that which commands
is greater and of higher authority than that which is commanded, inasmuch as the former
rules, while the latter is in a state of subjection. If, then, Marcus, or any one else, does command,—
as these are accustomed continually at their feasts to play at drawing lots, and [in
accordance with the lot] to command one another to prophesy, giving forth as oracles what
is in harmony with their own desires,—it will follow that he who commands is greater and
of higher authority than the prophetic spirit, though he is but a man, which is impossible.
But such spirits as are commanded by these men, and speak when they desire it, are earthly
and weak, audacious and impudent, sent forth by Satan for the seduction and perdition of

those who do not hold fast that well-compacted faith which they received at first through
the Church.</p>
<p>5. Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and love-potions, in order to insult
the persons of some of these women, if not of all, those of them who have returned to the
Church of God— a thing which frequently occurs—have acknowledged, confessing, too,
that they have been defiled by him, and that they were filled with a burning passion towards
him. A sad example of this occurred in the case of a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who
had received him (Marcus) into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a
victim both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time, travelled about with
him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the brethren had converted her, she spent her
whole time in the exercise of public confession,171 weeping over and lamenting the defilement
which she had received from this magician.</p>
<p>6. Some of his disciples, too, addicting themselves172 to the same practices, have deceived
many silly women, and defiled them. They proclaim themselves as being “perfect,” so that
no one can be compared to them with respect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor
even were you to mention Paul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They assert that they
themselves know more than all others, and that they alone have imbibed the greatness of
the knowledge of that power which is unspeakable. They also maintain that they have attained
to a height above all power, and that therefore they are free in every respect to act as they
please, having no one to fear in anything. For they affirm, that because of the “Redemption”
173 it has come to pass that they can neither be apprehended, nor even seen by the
judge. But even if he should happen to lay hold upon them, then they might simply repeat
these words, while standing in his presence along with the “Redemption:” “O thou, who
sittest beside God,174 and the mystical, eternal Sige, thou through whom the angels (mightiness),
who continually behold the face of the Father, having thee as their guide and introducer,
do derive their forms175 from above, which she in the greatness of her daring inspiring

her mind then intent upon the things above, as in a dream,— behold, the judge is at hand,

of both, present the cause of both of us to the judge, inasmuch as it is in reality but one
cause.”176 Now, as soon as the Mother hears these words, she puts the Homeric177 helmet
of Pluto upon them, so that they may invisibly escape the judge. And then she immediately
catches them up, conducts them into the bridal chamber, and hands them over to their
consorts.</p>
<p>7. Such are the words and deeds by which, in our own district of the Rhone, they have
deluded many women, who have their consciences seared as with a hot iron.178 Some of
them, indeed, make a public confession of their sins; but others of them are ashamed to do
this, and in a tacit kind of way, despairing of [attaining to] the life of God, have, some of
them, apostatized altogether; while others hesitate between the two courses, and incur that
which is implied in the proverb, “neither without nor within;” possessing this as the fruit
from the seed of the children of knowledge.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The various hypotheses of Marcus and others. Theories respecting
letters and syllables.</head>
<p>1. This Marcus179 then, declaring that he alone was the matrix and receptacle of the
Sige of Colorbasus, inasmuch as he was only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some
such way as follows that which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. He declares
that the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from the invisible and indescribable
places in the form of a woman (for the world could not have borne it coming in its
male form), and expounded to him alone its own nature, and the origin of all things, which
it had never before revealed to any one either of gods or men. This was done in the following
terms: When first the unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who is without material substance,
180 and is neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which is ineffable to
Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He opened His mouth, and sent forth
the Word similar to Himself, who, standing near, showed Him what He Himself was, inasmuch
as He had been manifested in the form of that which was invisible. Moreover, the
pronunciation of His name took place as follows:—He spoke the first word of it, which was
the beginning181 [of all the rest], and that utterance consisted of four letters. He added the
second, and this also consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and this again
embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was composed of twelve
letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the whole name, consisting of thirty letters, and
four distinct utterances. Each of these elements has its own peculiar letters, and character,
and pronunciation, and forms, and images, and there is not one of them that perceives the
shape of that [utterance] of which it is an element. Neither does any one know182 itself, nor
is it acquainted with the pronunciation of its neighbour, but each one imagines that by its
own utterance it does in fact name the whole. For while every one of them is a part of the
whole, it imagines its own sound to be the whole name, and does not leave off sounding
<note type="footnote">179 This sentence has completely baffled all the critics. [Its banter, or mock gravity, has not been self-evident.]
We cannot enter upon the wide field of discussion which it has opened up, but would simply state that Irenæus
here seems to us, as often, to be playing upon the terms which were in common use among these heretics.
Marcus probably received his system from Colorbasus, and is here declared, by the use of that jargon which
Irenæus means to ridicule while so employing it, to have proceeded to develop it in the way described.</note>
<note type="footnote">180 Such appears to be the meaning of ἀνούσιος in this passage. The meaning of οὐσία fluctuated for a time
in the early Church, and was sometimes used to denote material substance, instead of its usual significance of
being.</note>
<note type="footnote">181 The old Latin preserves ἀρχή untranslated, implying that this was the first word which the Father spoke.
Some modern editors adopt this view, while others hold the meaning simply to be, as given above, that that first
sound which the Father uttered was the origin of all the rest.</note>
<note type="footnote">182 The letters are here confounded with the Æons, which they represented.</note>

<pb n="889"/>
until, by its own utterance, it has reached the last letter of each of the elements. This teacher
declares that the restitution of all things will take place, when all these, mixing into one letter,
shall utter one and the same sound. He imagines that the emblem of this utterance is found
in Amen, which we pronounce in concert.183 The diverse sounds (he adds) are those which
give form to that Æon who is without material substance and unbegotten, and these, again,
are the forms which the Lord has called angels, who continually behold the face of the
Father.184</p>
<p>2. Those names of the elements which may be told, and are common, he has called
Æons, and words, and roots, and seeds, and fulnesses, and fruits. He asserts that each of
these, and all that is peculiar to every one of them, is to be understood as contained in the
name Ecclesia. Of these elements, the last letter of the last one uttered its voice, and this
sound185 going forth generated its own elements after the image of the [other] elements,
by which he affirms, that both the things here below were arranged into the order they occupy,
and those that preceded them were called into existence. He also maintains that the
letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the
syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound
remained below as if cast outside. But the element itself from which the letter with its special
pronunciation descended to that below, he affirms to consist of thirty letters, while each of
these letters, again, contains other letters in itself, by means of which the name of the letter
is expressed. And thus, again, others are named by other letters, and others still by others,
so that the multitude of letters swells out into infinitude. You may more clearly understand
what I mean by the following example:—The word Delta contains five letters, viz., D, E, L,
T, A: these letters again, are written by other letters,186 and others still by others. If, then,
the entire composition of the word Delta [when thus analyzed] runs out into infinitude,
letters continually generating other letters, and following one another in constant succession,
how much vaster than that [one] word is the [entire] ocean of letters! And if even one letter
be thus infinite, just consider the immensity of the letters in the entire name; out of which
the Sige of Marcus has taught us the Propator is composed. For which reason the Father,
knowing the incomprehensibleness of His own nature, assigned to the elements which He
also terms Æons, [the power] of each one uttering its own enunciation, because no one of
them was capable by itself of uttering the whole.</p>

<p>3. Moreover, the Tetrad, explaining these things to him more fully, said:—I wish to
show thee Aletheia (Truth) herself; for I have brought her down from the dwellings above,
that thou mayest see her without a veil, and understand her beauty —that thou mayest also
hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom. Behold, then, her head on high, Alpha and
Omega; her neck, Beta and Psi; her shoulders with her hands, Gamma and Chi; her breast,
Delta and Phi; her diaphragm, Epsilon and Upsilon; her back, Zeta and Tau; her belly, Eta
and Sigma; her thighs, Theta and Rho; her knees, Iota and Pi; her legs, Kappa and Omicron;
her ankles, Lambda and Xi; her feet, Mu and Nu. Such is the body of Truth, according to
this magician, such the figure of the element, such the character of the letter. And he calls
this element Anthropos (Man), and says that is the fountain of all speech, and the beginning
of all sound, and the expression of all that is unspeakable, and the mouth of the silent Sige.
This indeed is the body of Truth. But do thou, elevating the thoughts of thy mind on high,
listen from the mouth of Truth to the self-begotten Word, who is also the dispenser of the
bounty of the Father.</p>
<p>4. When she (the Tetrad) had spoken these things, Aletheia looked at him, opened her
mouth, and uttered a word. That word was a name, and the name was this one which we
do know and speak of, viz., Christ Jesus. When she had uttered this name, she at once relapsed
into silence. And as Marcus waited in the expectation that she would say something more,
the Tetrad again came forward and said:—Thou hast reckoned as contemptible that word
which thou hast heard from the mouth of Aletheia. This which thou knowest and seemest
to possess, is not an ancient name. For thou possessest the sound of it merely, whilst thou
art ignorant of its power. For Jesus (᾽Ιησοῦς) is a name arithmetically187 symbolical, consisting
of six letters, and is known by all those that belong to the called. But that which is among
the Æons of the Pleroma consists of many parts, and is of another form and shape, and is
known by those [angels] who are joined in affinity with Him, and whose figures (mightinesses)
are always present with Him.</p>
<p>5. Know, then, that the four-and-twenty letters which you possess are symbolical emanations
of the three powers that contain the entire number of the elements above. For you
are to reckon thus —that the nine mute188 letters are [the images] of Pater and Aletheia,
because they are without voice, that is, of such a nature as cannot be uttered or pronounced.
But the semi-vowels189 represent Logos and Zoe, because they are, as it were, midway
<note type="footnote">187 The old Latin version renders ἐπίσημον, insigne, illustrious, but there seems to be a reference to the
Valentinian notion of the mystic number of 888 formed (10+8+200+70+400+200) by the numerical value of
the letters in the word ᾽Ιησοῦς.</note>
<note type="footnote">188 The mutes are π, κ, τ, β, γ, δ, φ, χ, θ.</note>

<pb n="891"/>
between the consonants and the vowels, partaking190 of the nature of both. The vowels,
again, are representative of Anthropos and Ecclesia, inasmuch as a voice proceeding from
Anthropos gave being to them all; for the sound of the voice imparted to them form. Thus,
then, Logos and Zoe possess eight [of these letters]; Anthropos and Ecclesia seven; and Pater
and Aletheia nine. But since the number allotted to each was unequal, He who existed in
the Father came down, having been specially sent by Him from whom He was separated,
for the rectification of what had taken place, that the unity of the Pleromas, being endowed
with equality, might develop in all that one power which flows from all. Thus that division
which had only seven letters, received the power of eight,191 and the three sets were rendered
alike in point of number, all becoming Ogdoads; which three, when brought together, constitute
the number four-and-twenty. The three elements, too (which he declares to exist in
conjunction with three powers,192 and thus form the six from which have flowed the twentyfour
letters), being quadrupled by the word of the ineffable Tetrad, give rise to the same
number with them; and these elements he maintains to belong to Him who cannot be named.
These, again, were endowed by the three powers with a resemblance to Him who is invisible.
And he says that those letters which we call double193 are the images of the images of these
elements; and if these be added to the four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy they
form the number thirty.</p>
<p>6. He asserts that the fruit of this arrangement and analogy has been manifested in the
likeness of an image, namely, Him who, after six days, ascended194 into the mountain along
with three others, and then became one of six (the sixth),195 in which character He descended
and was contained in the Hebdomad, since He was the illustrious Ogdoad,196 and contained
in Himself the entire number of the elements, which the descent of the dove (who is Alpha
and Omega) made clearly manifest, when He came to be baptized; for the number of the
dove is eight hundred and one.197 And for this reason did Moses declare that man was

formed on the sixth day; and then, again, according to arrangement, it was on the sixth day,
which is the preparation, that the last man appeared, for the regeneration of the first. Of
this arrangement, both the beginning and the end were formed at that sixth hour, at which
He was nailed to the tree. For that perfect being Nous, knowing that the number six had
the power both of formation and regeneration, declared to the children of light, that regeneration
which has been wrought out by Him who appeared as the Episemon in regard to
that number. Whence also he declares it is that the double letters198 contain the Episemon
number; for this Episemon, when joined to the twenty-four elements, completed the name
of thirty letters.</p>
<p>7. He employed as his instrument, as the Sige of Marcus declares, the power of seven
letters,199 in order that the fruit of the independent will [of Achamoth] might be revealed.
“Consider this present Episemon,” she says—“Him who was formed after the [original]
Episemon, as being, as it were, divided or cut into two parts, and remaining outside; who,
by His own power and wisdom, through means of that which had been produced by Himself,
gave life to this world, consisting of seven powers,200 after the likeness of the power of the
Hebdomad, and so formed it, that it is the soul of everything visible. And He indeed uses
this work Himself as if it had been formed by His own free will; but the rest, as being images
of what cannot be [fully] imitated, are subservient to the Enthymesis of the mother. And
the first heaven indeed pronounces Alpha, the next to this Epsilon, the third Eta, the fourth,
which is also in the midst of the seven, utters the sound of Iota, the fifth Omicron, the sixth
Upsilon, the seventh, which is also the fourth from the middle, utters the elegant Omega,”—
as the Sige of Marcus, talking a deal of nonsense, but uttering no word of truth, confidently
asserts. “And these powers,” she adds, “being all simultaneously clasped in each other’s
embrace, do sound out the glory of Him by whom they were produced; and the glory of that
sound is transmitted upwards to the Propator.” She asserts, moreover, that “the sound of
this uttering of praise, having been wafted to the earth, has become the Framer and the
Parent of those things which are on the earth.”</p>
<p>8. He instances, in proof of this, the case of infants who have just been born, the cry of
whom, as soon as they have issued from the womb, is in accordance with the sound of every
one of these elements. As, then, he says, the seven powers glorify the Word, so also does the
complaining soul of infants.201 For this reason, too, David said: “Out of the mouth of babes
and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise;”202 and again: “The heavens declare the glory of

God.”203 Hence also it comes to pass, that when the soul is involved in difficulties and distresses,
for its own relief it calls out, “Oh” (Ω), in honour of the letter in question,204 so that
its cognate soul above may recognise [its distress], and send down to it relief.</p>
<p>9. Thus it is, that in regard to the whole name,205 which consists of thirty letters, and
Bythus, who receives his increase from the letters of this [name], and, moreover, the body
of Aletheia, which is composed of twelve members, each of which consists of two letters,
and the voice which she uttered without having spoken at all, and in regard to the analysis
of that name which cannot be expressed in words, and the soul of the world and of man,
according as they possess that arrangement, which is after the image [of things above], he
has uttered his nonsensical opinions. It remains that I relate how the Tetrad showed him
from the names a power equal in number; so that nothing, my friend, which I have received
as spoken by him, may remain unknown to thee; and thus thy request, often proposed to

<head>Chapter XV.—Sige relates to Marcus the generation of the twenty-four elements
and of Jesus. Exposure of these absurdities.</head>
<p>1. The all-wise Sige then announced the production of the four-and-twenty elements
to him as follows:—Along with Monotes there coexisted Henotes, from which sprang two
productions, as we have remarked above, Monas and Hen, which, added to the other two,
make four, for twice two are four. And again, two and four, when added together, exhibit
the number six. And further, these six being quadrupled, give rise to the twenty-four forms.
And the names of the first Tetrad, which are understood to be most holy, and not capable
of being expressed in words, are known by the Son alone, while the father also knows what
they are. The other names which are to be uttered with respect, and faith, and reverence,
are, according to him, Arrhetos and Sige, Pater and Aletheia. Now the entire number of this
Tetrad amounts to four-and-twenty letters; for the name Arrhetos contains in itself seven
letters, Seige206 five, Pater five, and Aletheia seven. If all these be added together—twice
five, and twice seven—they complete the number twenty-four. In like manner, also, the
second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, reveal the same number of elements.
Moreover, that name of the Saviour which may be pronounced, viz., Jesus [᾽Ιησοῦς], consists
of six letters, but His unutterable name comprises four-and-twenty letters. The name Christ
the Son207 (υἱὸς Χρειστός) comprises twelve letters, but that which is unpronounceable in
Christ contains thirty letters. And for this reason he declares that He is Alpha and Omega,
that he may indicate the dove, inasmuch as that bird has this number [in its name].</p>
<p>2. But Jesus, he affirms, has the following unspeakable origin. From the mother of all
things, that is, the first Tetrad, there came forth the second Tetrad, after the manner of a
daughter; and thus an Ogdoad was formed, from which, again, a Decad proceeded: thus
was produced a Decad and an Ogdoad. The Decad, then, being joined with the Ogdoad,
and multiplying it ten times, gave rise to the number eighty; and, again, multiplying eighty
ten times, produced the number eight hundred. Thus, then, the whole number of the letters
proceeding from the Ogdoad [multiplied] into the Decad, is eight hundred and eightyeight.
208 This is the name of Jesus; for this name, if you reckon up the numerical value of
the letters, amounts to eight hundred and eighty-eight. Thus, then, you have a clear statement
of their opinion as to the origin of the supercelestial Jesus. Wherefore, also, the alphabet of
the Greeks contains eight Monads, eight Decads, and eight Hecatads209, which present the
<note type="footnote">206 Manifestly to be so spelt here, as in the sequel Chreistus, for Christus.</note>
<note type="footnote">207 The text is here altogether uncertain, and the meaning obscure.</note>
<note type="footnote">208 The reading is exceedingly doubtful: some prefer the number eighty-eight.</note>
<note type="footnote">209 There were, as Harvey observes, three extraneous characters introduced into the Greek alphabet for the
sake of numeration —the three episema for 6, 90, and 900 respectively. The true alphabet, then, as employed to

<pb n="895"/>
number eight hundred and eighty-eight, that is, Jesus, who is formed of all numbers; and
on this account He is called Alpha and Omega, indicating His origin from all. And, again,
they put the matter thus: If the first Tetrad be added up according to the progression of
number, the number ten appears. For one, and two, and three, and four, when added together,
form ten; and this, as they will have it, is Jesus. Moreover, Chreistus, he says, being a word
of eight letters, indicates the first Ogdoad, and this, when multiplied by ten, gives birth to
Jesus (888). And Christ the Son, he says, is also spoken of, that is, the Duodecad. For the
name Son, (υἰός) contains four letters, and Christ (Chreistus) eight, which, being combined,
point out the greatness of the Duodecad. But, he alleges, before the Episemon of this name
appeared, that is Jesus the Son, mankind were involved in great ignorance and error. But
when this name of six letters was manifested (the person bearing it clothing Himself in flesh,
that He might come under the apprehension of man’s senses, and having in Himself these
six and twenty-four letters), then, becoming acquainted with Him, they ceased from their
ignorance, and passed from death unto life, this name serving as their guide to the Father
of truth.210 For the Father of all had resolved to put an end to ignorance, and to destroy
death. But this abolishing of ignorance was just the knowledge of Him. And therefore that
man (Anthropos) was chosen according to His will, having been formed after the image of
the [corresponding] power above.</p>
<p>3. As to the Æons, they proceeded from the Tetrad, and in that Tetrad were Anthropos
and Ecclesia, Logos and Zoe. The powers, then, he declares, who emanated from these,
generated that Jesus who appeared upon the earth. The angel Gabriel took the place of Logos,
the Holy Spirit that of Zoe, the Power of the Highest that of Anthropos, while the Virgin
pointed out the place of Ecclesia. And thus, by a special dispensation, there was generated
by Him, through Mary, that man, whom, as He passed through the womb, the Father of all
chose to [obtain] the knowledge of Himself by means of the Word. And on His coming to
the water [of baptism], there descended on Him, in the form of a dove, that Being who had
formerly ascended on high, and completed the twelfth number, in whom there existed the
seed of those who were produced contemporaneously with Himself, and who descended
and ascended along with Him. Moreover, he maintains that power which descended was
the seed of the Father, which had in itself both the Father and the Son, as well as that power
of Sige which is known by means of them, but cannot be expressed in language, and also all
the Æons. And this was that Spirit who spoke by the mouth of Jesus, and who confessed
that He was the son of Man as well as revealed the Father, and who, having descended into
Jesus, was made one with Him. And he says that the Saviour formed by special dispensation
did indeed destroy death, but that Christ made known the Father.211 He maintains, therefore,
<note type="footnote">210 Or, according to the Greek text, “being as the way to the Father;” comp. John xiv. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">211 The text is here uncertain: we follow that suggested by Grabe.</note>

<pb n="896"/>
that Jesus is the name of that man formed by a special dispensation, and that He was formed
after the likeness and form of that [heavenly] Anthropos, who was about to descend upon
Him. After He had received that Æon, He possessed Anthropos himself, and Logos himself,
and Pater, and Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and Ecclesia, and Zoe.</p>
<p>4. Such ravings, we may now well say, go beyond Iu, Iu, Pheu, Pheu, and every kind of
tragic exclamation or utterance of misery.212 For who would not detest one who is the
wretched contriver of such audacious falsehoods, when he perceives the truth turned by
Marcus into a mere image, and that punctured all over with the letters of the alphabet? The
Greeks confess that they first received sixteen letters from Cadmus, and that but recently,
as compared with the beginning, [the vast antiquity of which is implied] in the common
proverb: “Yesterday and before;”213 and afterwards, in the course of time, they themselves
invented at one period the aspirates, and at another the double letters, while, last of all, they
say Palamedes added the long letters to the former. Was it so, then, that until these things
took place among the Greeks, truth had no existence? For, according to thee, Marcus, the
body of truth is posterior to Cadmus and those who preceded him— posterior also to those
who added the rest of the letters— posterior even to thyself! For thou alone hast formed
that which is called by thee the truth into an [outward, visible] image.</p>
<p>5. But who will tolerate thy nonsensical Sige, who names Him that cannot be named,
and expounds the nature of Him that is unspeakable, and searches out Him that is unsearchable,
and declares that He whom thou maintainest to be destitute of body and form, opened
His mouth and sent forth the Word, as if He were included among organized beings; and
that His Word, while like to His Author, and bearing the image of the invisible, nevertheless
consisted of thirty elements and four syllables? It will follow, then, according to thy theory,
that the Father of all, in accordance with the likeness of the Word, consists of thirty elements
and four syllables! Or, again, who will tolerate thee in thy juggling with forms and numbers,—
at one time thirty, at another twenty-four, and at another, again, only six,—whilst
thou shuttest up [in these] the Word of God, the Founder, and Framer, and Maker of all
things; and then, again, cutting Him up piecemeal into four syllables and thirty elements;
and bringing down the Lord of all who founded the heavens to the number eight hundred
and eighty-eight, so that He should be similar to the alphabet; and subdividing the Father,
who cannot be contained, but contains all things, into a Tetrad, and an Ogdoad, and a Decad,
and a Duodecad; and by such multiplications, setting forth the unspeakable and inconceivable
nature of the Father, as thou thyself declarest it to be? And showing thyself a very Dædalus
for evil invention, and the wicked architect of the supreme power, thou dost construct a

nature and substance for Him whom thou callest incorporeal and immaterial, out of a
multitude of letters, generated the one by the other. And that power whom thou affirmest
to be indivisible, thou dost nevertheless divide into consonants, and vowels, and semivowels;
and, falsely ascribing those letters which are mute to the Father of all things, and to
His Ennoea (thought), thou hast driven on all that place confidence in thee to the highest
point of blasphemy, and to the grossest impiety.214</p>
<p>6. With good reason, therefore, and very fittingly, in reference to thy rash attempt, has
that divine elder215 and preacher of the truth burst forth in verse against thee as follows:—
<lg>
<l>“Marcus, thou former of idols, inspector of portents,</l>
<l>Skill’d in consulting the stars, and deep in the black arts of magic,</l>
<l>Ever by tricks such as these confirming the doctrines of error,</l>

<l>By means of Azazel, that fallen and yet mighty angel,—</l>
<l>Thus making thee the precursor of his own impious actions.”</l>

<p>Such are the words of the saintly elder. And I shall endeavour to state the remainder of
their mystical system, which runs out to great length, in brief compass, and to bring to the
light what has for a long time been concealed. For in this way such things will become easily
susceptible of exposure by all.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Absurd interpretations of the Marcosians.</head>
<p>1. Blending in one the production of their own Æons, and the straying and recovery of
the sheep [spoken of in the Gospel216], these persons endeavour to set forth things in a more
mystical style, while they refer everything to numbers, maintaining that the universe has
been formed out of a Monad and a Dyad. And then, reckoning from unity on to four, they
thus generate the Decad. For when one, two, three, and four are added together, they give
rise to the number of the ten Æons. And, again, the Dyad advancing from itself [by twos]
up to six—two, and four, and six—brings out the Duodecad. Once more, if we reckon in
the same way up to ten, the number thirty appears, in which are found eight, and ten, and
twelve. They therefore term the Duodecad—because it contains the Episemon,217 and because
the Episemon [so to speak] waits upon it—the passion. And for this reason, because an error
occurred in connection with the twelfth number,218 the sheep frisked off, and went astray;
for they assert that a defection took place from the Duodecad. In the same way they oracularly
declare, that one power having departed also from the Duodecad, has perished; and this
was represented by the woman who lost the drachma,219 and, lighting a lamp, again found
it. Thus, therefore, the numbers that were left, viz., nine, as respects the pieces of money,
and eleven in regard to the sheep,220 when multiplied together, give birth to the number
ninety-nine, for nine times eleven are ninety-nine. Wherefore also they maintain the word
“Amen” contains this number.</p>
<p>2. I will not, however, weary thee by recounting their other interpretations, that you
may perceive the results everywhere. They maintain for instance, that the letter Eta (η) along
with the Episemon (ς) constitutes an Ogdoad, inasmuch as it occupies the eighth place from
the first letter. Then, again, without the Episemon, reckoning the number of the letters, and
adding them up till we come to Eta, they bring out the Triacontad. For if one begins at Alpha
and ends with Eta, omitting the Episemon, and adds together the value of the letters in succession,
he will find their number altogether to amount to thirty. For up to Epsilon (ε) fifteen
are formed; then adding seven to that number, the sum of twenty-two is reached. Next, Eta
being added to these, since its value is eight, the most wonderful Triacontad is completed.
And hence they give forth that the Ogdoad is the mother of the thirty Æons. Since, therefore,
the number thirty is composed of three powers [the Ogdoad, Decad, and Duodecad], when

multiplied by three, it produces ninety, for three times thirty are ninety. Likewise this Triad,
when multiplied by itself, gives rise to nine. Thus the Ogdoad generates, by these means,
ninety-nine. And since the twelfth Æon, by her defection, left eleven in the heights above,
they maintain that therefore the position of the letters is a true coordinate of the method of
their calculation221 (for Lambda is the eleventh in order among the letters, and represents
the number thirty), and also forms a representation of the arrangement of affairs above,
since, on from Alpha, omitting Episemon, the number of the letters up to Lambda, when
added together according to the successive value of the letters, and including Lambda itself,
forms the sum of ninety-nine; but that this Lambda, being the eleventh in order, descended
to seek after one equal to itself, so as to complete the number of twelve letters, and when it
found such a one, the number was completed, is manifest from the very configuration of
the letter; for Lambda being engaged, as it were, in the quest of one similar to itself, and
finding such an one, and clasping it to itself, thus filled up the place of the twelfth, the letter
Mu (Μ) being composed of two Lambdas (ΛΛ). Wherefore also they, by means of their
“knowledge,” avoid the place of ninety-nine, that is, the defection—a type of the left
hand,222—but endeavour to secure one more, which, when added to the ninety and nine,
has the effect of changing their reckoning to the right hand.</p>
<p>3. I well know, my dear friend, that when thou hast read through all this, thou wilt indulge
in a hearty laugh over this their inflated wise folly! But those men are really worthy of being
mourned over, who promulgate such a kind of religion, and who so frigidly and perversely
pull to pieces the greatness of the truly unspeakable power, and the dispensations of God
in themselves so striking, by means of Alpha and Beta, and through the aid of numbers. But
as many as separate from the Church, and give heed to such old wives’ fables as these, are
truly self-condemned; and these men Paul commands us, “after a first and second admoni-
tion, to avoid.”223 And John, the disciple of the Lord, has intensified their condemnation,
when he desires us not even to address to them the salutation of “good-speed;” for, says he,
“He that bids them be of good-speed is a partaker with their evil deeds;”224 and that with
reason, “for there is no good-speed to the ungodly,”225 saith the Lord. Impious indeed,
beyond all impiety, are these men, who assert that the Maker of heaven and earth, the only
God Almighty, besides whom there is no God, was produced by means of a defect, which

third defect.226 Such an opinion we should detest and execrate, while we ought everywhere
to flee far apart from those that hold it; and in proportion as they vehemently maintain and
rejoice in their fictitious doctrines, so much the more should we be convinced that they are
under the influence of the wicked spirits of the Ogdoad,—just as those persons who fall into
a fit of frenzy, the more they laugh, and imagine themselves to be well, and do all things as
if they were in good health [both of body and mind], yea, some things better than those who
really are so, are only thus shown to be the more seriously diseased. In like manner do these
men, the more they seem to excel others in wisdom, and waste their strength by drawing
the bow too tightly,227 the greater fools do they show themselves. For when the unclean
spirit of folly has gone forth, and when afterwards he finds them not waiting upon God, but
occupied with mere worldly questions, then, “taking seven other spirits more wicked than
himself,”228 and inflating the minds of these men with the notion of their being able to
conceive of something beyond God, and having fitly prepared them for the reception of
deceit, he implants within them the Ogdoad of the foolish spirits of wickedness.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The theory of the Marcosians, that created things were made
after the image of things invisible.</head>
<p>1. I wish also to explain to thee their theory as to the way in which the creation itself
was formed through the mother by the Demiurge (as it were without his knowledge), after
the image of things invisible. They maintain, then, that first of all the four elements, fire,
water, earth, and air, were produced after the image of the primary Tetrad above, and that
then, we add their operations, viz., heat, cold, dryness, and humidity, an exact likeness of
the Ogdoad is presented. They next reckon up ten powers in the following manner:—There
are seven globular bodies, which they also call heavens; then that globular body which contains
these, which also they name the eighth heaven; and, in addition to these, the sun and
moon. These, being ten in number, they declare to be types of the invisible Decad, which
proceeded from Logos and Zoe. As to the Duodecad, it is indicated by the zodiacal circle,
as it is called; for they affirm that the twelve signs do most manifestly shadow forth the
Duodecad, the daughter of Anthropos and Ecclesia. And since the highest heaven, beating
upon the very sphere [of the seventh heaven], has been linked with the most rapid precession
of the whole system, as a check, and balancing that system with its own gravity, so that it
completes the cycle from sign to sign in thirty years,—they say that this is an image of
Horus, encircling their thirty-named mother.229 And then, again, as the moon travels
through her allotted space of heaven in thirty days, they hold, that by these days she expresses
the number of the thirty Æons. The sun also, who runs through his orbit in twelve months,
and then returns to the same point in the circle, makes the Duodecad manifest by these
twelve months; and the days, as being measured by twelve hours, are a type of the invisible
Duodecad. Moreover, they declare that the hour, which is the twelfth part of the day, is
composed230 of thirty parts, in order to set forth the image of the Triacontad. Also the circumference
of the zodiacal circle itself contains three hundred and sixty degrees (for each
of its signs comprises thirty); and thus also they affirm, that by means of this circle an image
is preserved of that connection which exists between the twelve and the thirty. Still further,
asserting that the earth is divided into twelve zones, and that in each zone it receives power
from the heavens, according to the perpendicular [position of the sun above it], bringing
forth productions corresponding to that power which sends down its influence upon it,
they maintain that this is a most evident type of the Duodecad and its offspring.</p>
<p>2. In addition to these things, they declare that the Demiurge, desiring to imitate the
infinitude, and eternity, and immensity, and freedom from all measurement by time of the
Ogdoad above, but, as he was the fruit of defect, being unable to express its permanence
<note type="footnote">229 Such is the translation which Harvey, following the text preserved by Hippolytus, gives of the above intricate
and obscure sentence.ñ</note>

and eternity, had recourse to the expedient of spreading out its eternity into times, and
seasons, and vast numbers of years, imagining, that by the multitude of such times he might
imitate its immensity. They declare further, that the truth having escaped him, he followed
that which was false, and that, for this reason, when the times are fulfilled, his work shall
perish.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Passages from Moses, which the heretics pervert to the support
of their hypothesis.</head>
<p>1. And while they affirm such things as these concerning the creation, every one of them
generates something new, day by day, according to his ability; for no one is deemed “perfect,”
who does not develop among them some mighty fictions. It is thus necessary, first, to indicate
what things they metamorphose [to their own use] out of the prophetical writings, and next,
to refute them. Moses, then, they declare, by his mode of beginning the account of the creation,
has at the commencement pointed out the mother of all things when he says, “In the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth;”231 for, as they maintain, by naming these
four,—God, beginning, heaven, and earth,—he set forth their Tetrad. Indicating also its invisible
and hidden nature, he said, “Now the earth was invisible and unformed.”232 They
will have it, moreover, that he spoke of the second Tetrad, the offspring of the first, in this
way—by naming an abyss and darkness, in which were also water, and the Spirit moving
upon the water. Then, proceeding to mention the Decad, he names light, day, night, the
firmament, the evening, the morning, dry land, sea, plants, and, in the tenth place, trees.
Thus, by means of these ten names, he indicated the ten Æons. The power of the Duodecad,
again, was shadowed forth by him thus:—He names the sun, moon, stars, seasons, years,
whales, fishes, reptiles, birds, quadrupeds, wild beasts, and after all these, in the twelfth place,
man. Thus they teach that the Triacontad was spoken of through Moses by the Spirit.
Moreover, man also, being formed after the image of the power above, had in himself that
ability which flows from the one source. This ability was seated in the region of the brain,
from which four faculties proceed, after the image of the Tetrad above, and these are called:
the first, sight, the second, hearing, the third, smell, and the fourth,233 taste. And they say
that the Ogdoad is indicated by man in this way: that he possesses two ears, the like number
of eyes, also two nostrils, and a twofold taste, namely, of bitter and sweet. Moreover, they
teach that the whole man contains the entire image of the Triacontad as follows: In his
hands, by means of his fingers, he bears the Decad; and in his whole body the Duodecad,
inasmuch as his body is divided into twelve members; for they portion that out, as the body
of Truth is divided by them—a point of which we have already spoken.234 But the Ogdoad,
as being unspeakable and invisible, is understood as hidden in the viscera.</p>
<p>2. Again, they assert that the sun, the great light-giver, was formed on the fourth day,
with a reference to the number of the Tetrad. So also, according to them, the courts235 of

the tabernacle constructed by Moses, being composed of fine linen, and blue, and purple,
and scarlet, pointed to the same image. Moreover, they maintain that the long robe of the
priest falling over his feet, as being adorned with four rows of precious stones,236 indicates
the Tetrad; and if there are any other things in the Scriptures which can possibly be dragged
into the number four, they declare that these had their being with a view to the Tetrad. The
Ogdoad, again, was shown as follows:—They affirm that man was formed on the eighth
day, for sometimes they will have him to have been made on the sixth day, and sometimes
on the eighth, unless, perchance, they mean that his earthly part was formed on the sixth
day, but his fleshly part on the eighth, for these two things are distinguished by them. Some
of them also hold that one man was formed after the image and likeness of God, masculofeminine,
and that this was the spiritual man; and that another man was formed out of the
earth.</p>
<p>3. Further, they declare that the arrangement made with respect to the ark in the Deluge,
by means of which eight persons were saved,237 most clearly indicates the Ogdoad which
brings salvation. David also shows forth the same, as holding the eighth place in point of
age among his brethren.238 Moreover, that circumcision which took place on the eighth
day,239 represented the circumcision of the Ogdoad above. In a word, whatever they find
in the Scriptures capable of being referred to the number eight, they declare to fulfil the
mystery of the Ogdoad. With respect, again, to the Decad, they maintain that it is indicated
by those ten nations which God promised to Abraham for a possession.240 The arrangement
also made by Sarah when, after ten years, she gave241 her handmaid Hagar to him, that by
her he might have a son, showed the same thing. Moreover, the servant of Abraham who
was sent to Rebekah, and presented her at the well with ten bracelets of gold, and her
brethren who detained her for ten days;242 Jeroboam also, who received the ten sceptres243
(tribes), and the ten courts244 of the tabernacle, and the columns of ten cubits245 [high],
and the ten sons of Jacob who were at first sent into Egypt to buy corn,246 and the ten apostles

to whom the Lord appeared after His resurrection,—Thomas247 being absent,—represented,
according to them, the invisible Decad.</p>
<p>4. As to the Duodecad, in connection with which the mystery of the passion of the defect
occurred, from which passion they maintain that all things visible were framed, they assert
that is to be found strikingly and manifestly everywhere [in Scripture]. For they declare that
the twelve sons of Jacob,248 from whom also sprung twelve tribes,— the breastplate of the
high priest, which bore twelve precious stones and twelve little bells,249—the twelve stones
which were placed by Moses at the foot of the mountain,250—the same number which was
placed by Joshua in the river,251 and again, on the other side, the bearers of the ark of the
covenant,252—those stones which were set up by Elijah when the heifer was offered as a
burnt-offering;253 the number, too, of the apostles; and, in fine, every event which embraces
in it the number twelve,—set forth their Duodecad. And then the union of all these, which
is called the Triacontad, they strenuously endeavour to demonstrate by the ark of Noah, the
height of which was thirty cubits;254 by the case of Samuel, who assigned Saul the chief place
among thirty guests;255 by David, when for thirty days he concealed himself in the field;256
by those who entered along with him into the cave; also by the fact that the length (height)
of the holy tabernacle was thirty cubits;257 and if they meet with any other like numbers,
they still apply these to their Triacontad.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Passages of Scripture by which they attempt to prove that the
Supreme Father was unknown before the coming of Christ.</head>
<p>1. I judge it necessary to add to these details also what, by garbling passages of Scripture,
they try to persuade us concerning their Propator, who was unknown to all before the
coming of Christ. Their object in this is to show that our Lord announced another Father
than the Maker of this universe, whom, as we said before, they impiously declare to have
been the fruit of a defect. For instance, when the prophet Isaiah says, “But Israel hath not
known Me, and My people have not understood Me,”258 they pervert his words to mean
ignorance of the invisible Bythus. And that which is spoken by Hosea, “There is no truth in
them, nor the knowledge of God,”259 they strive to give the same reference. And, “There is
none that understandeth, or that seeketh after God: they have all gone out of the way, they
are together become unprofitable,”260 they maintain to be said concerning ignorance of
Bythus. Also that which is spoken by Moses, “No man shall see God and live,”261 has, as
they would persuade us, the same reference.</p>
<p>2. For they falsely hold, that the Creator was seen by the prophets. But this passage, “No
man shall see God and live,” they would interpret as spoken of His greatness unseen and
unknown by all; and indeed that these words, “No man shall see God,” are spoken concerning
the invisible Father, the Maker of the universe, is evident to us all; but that they are not used
concerning that Bythus whom they conjure into existence, but concerning the Creator (and
He is the invisible God), shall be shown as we proceed. They maintain that Daniel also set
forth the same thing when he begged of the angels explanations of the parables, as being
himself ignorant of them. But the angel, hiding from him the great mystery of Bythus, said
unto him, “Go thy way quickly, Daniel, for these sayings are closed up until those who have
understanding do understand them, and those who are white be made white.”262 Moreover,
they vaunt themselves as being the white and the men of good understanding.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—The apocryphal and spurious Scriptures of the Marcosians, with
passages of the Gospels which they pervert.</head>
<p>1. Besides the above [misrepresentations], they adduce an unspeakable number of apocryphal
and spurious writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds
they bring forward that false and wicked story263 which relates that our Lord, when He was
a boy learning His letters, on the teacher saying to Him, as is usual, “Pronounce Alpha,”
replied [as He was bid], “Alpha.” But when, again, the teacher bade Him say, “Beta,” the
Lord replied, “Do thou first tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell thee what Beta is.”
This they expound as meaning that He alone knew the Unknown, which He revealed under
its type Alpha.</p>
<p>2. Some passages, also, which occur in the Gospels, receive from them a colouring of
the same kind, such as the answer which He gave His mother when He was twelve years of
age: “Wist ye not that I must be about My Father’s business?”264 Thus, they say, He announced
to them the Father of whom they were ignorant. On this account, also, He sent
forth the disciples to the twelve tribes, that they might proclaim to them the unknown God.
And to the person who said to Him, “Good Master,”265 He confessed that God who is truly
good, saying, “Why callest thou Me good: there is One who is good, the Father in the heavens;”
266 and they assert that in this passage the Æons receive the name of heavens. Moreover,
by His not replying to those who said to Him, “By what power doest Thou this?”267 but by
a question on His own side, put them to utter confusion; by His thus not replying, according
to their interpretation, He showed the unutterable nature of the Father. Moreover, when
He said, “I have often desired to hear one of these words, and I had no one who could utter
it,”268 they maintain, that by this expression “one” He set forth the one true God whom
they knew not. Further, when, as He drew nigh to Jerusalem, He wept over it and said, “If
thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace, but
they are hidden from thee,”269 by this word “hidden” He showed the abstruse nature of
Bythus. And again, when He said, “Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,

and I will give you rest, and learn of Me,”270 He announced the Father of truth. For what
they knew not, these men say that He promised to teach them.</p>
<p>3. But they adduce the following passage as the highest testimony,271 and, as it were,
the very crown of their system:—“I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.
Even so, my Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight. All things have been delivered to
Me by My Father; and no one knoweth the Father but the Son, or the Son but the Father,
and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.”272 In these words they affirm that He clearly
showed that the Father of truth, conjured into existence by them, was known to no one before
His advent. And they desire to construe the passage as if teaching that the Maker and Framer
[of the world] was always known by all, while the Lord spoke these words concerning the
Father unknown to all, whom they now proclaim.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The views of redemption entertained by these heretics.</head>
<p>1. It happens that their tradition respecting redemption273 is invisible and incomprehensible,
as being the mother of things which are incomprehensible and invisible; and on
this account, since it is fluctuating, it is impossible simply and all at once to make known
its nature, for every one of them hands it down just as his own inclination prompts. Thus
there are as many schemes of “redemption” as there are teachers of these mystical opinions.
And when we come to refute them, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this class of men
have been instigated by Satan to a denial of that baptism which is regeneration to God, and
thus to a renunciation of the whole [Christian] faith.</p>
<p>2. They maintain that those who have attained to perfect knowledge must of necessity
be regenerated into that power which is above all. For it is otherwise impossible to find admittance
within the Pleroma, since this [regeneration] it is which leads them down into the
depths of Bythus. For the baptism instituted by the visible Jesus was for the remission of
sins, but the redemption brought in by that Christ who descended upon Him, was for perfection;
and they allege that the former is animal, but the latter spiritual. And the baptism
of John was proclaimed with a view to repentance, but the redemption by Jesus274 was
brought in for the sake of perfection. And to this He refers when He says, “And I have another
baptism to be baptized with, and I hasten eagerly towards it.”275 Moreover, they affirm
that the Lord added this redemption to the sons of Zebedee, when their mother asked that
they might sit, the one on His right hand, and the other on His left, in His kingdom, saying,
“Can ye be baptized with the baptism which I shall be baptized with?”276 Paul, too, they
declare, has often set forth, in express terms, the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; and
this was the same which is handed down by them in so varied and discordant forms.</p>
<p>3. For some of them prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of mystic rite (pronouncing
certain expressions) with those who are being initiated, and affirm that it is a spiritual
marriage which is celebrated by them, after the likeness of the conjunctions above. Others,
again, lead them to a place where water is, and baptize them, with the utterance of these
words, “Into the name of the unknown Father of the universe— into truth, the mother of
all things—into Him who descended on Jesus—into union, and redemption, and communion
with the powers.” Others still repeat certain Hebrew words, in order the more thoroughly
to bewilder those who are being initiated, as follows: “Basema, Chamosse, Baoenaora, Mistadia,
Ruada, Kousta, Babaphor, Kalachthei.”277 The interpretation of these terms runs thus:
<note type="footnote">273 Comp. chap. xiii. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">274 The Latin reads “Christ.”</note>
<note type="footnote">275 Luke xii. 50. The text was probably thus corrupted by the heretics.</note>
<note type="footnote">276 Mark x. 38.</note>
<note type="footnote">277 We have given these words as they stand in the Greek text: a very different list, but equally unmeaning,
is found in the Latin.</note>

<pb n="910"/>
“I invoke that which is above every power of the Father, which is called light, and good
Spirit, and life, because Thou hast reigned in the body.” Others, again, set forth the redemption
thus: The name which is hidden from every deity, and dominion, and truth which Jesus
of Nazareth was clothed with in the lives278 of the light of Christ—of Christ, who lives by
the Holy Ghost, for the angelic redemption. The name of restitution stands thus: Messia,
Uphareg, Namempsoeman, Chaldoeaur, Mosomedoea, Acphranoe, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria.279
The interpretation of these words is as follows: “I do not divide the Spirit of Christ, neither
the heart nor the supercelestial power which is merciful; may I enjoy Thy name, O Saviour
of truth!” Such are words of the initiators; but he who is initiated, replies, “I am established,
and I am redeemed; I redeem my soul from this age (world), and from all things connected
with it in the name of Iao, who redeemed his own soul into redemption in Christ who liveth.”
Then the bystanders add these words, “Peace be to all on whom this name rests.” After this
they anoint the initiated person with balsam; for they assert that this unguent is a type of
that sweet odour which is above all things.</p>
<p>4. But there are some of them who assert that it is superfluous to bring persons to the
water, but mixing oil and water together, they place this mixture on the heads of those who
are to be initiated, with the use of some such expressions as we have already mentioned.
And this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are accustomed to anoint with
balsam. Others, however, reject all these practices, and maintain that the mystery of the
unspeakable and invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible
creatures, nor should that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and
beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of sense, and possessed
of a body. These hold that the knowledge of the unspeakable Greatness is itself perfect redemption.
For since both defect and passion flowed from ignorance, the whole substance
of what was thus formed is destroyed by knowledge; and therefore knowledge is the redemption
of the inner man. This, however, is not of a corporeal nature, for the body is corruptible;
nor is it animal, since the animal soul is the fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the abode of
the spirit. The redemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature; for they affirm that the
inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means of knowledge, and that they, having acquired
the knowledge of all things, stand thenceforth in need of nothing else. This, then, is the true
redemption.</p>
<p>5. Others still there are who continue to redeem persons even up to the moment of
death, by placing on their heads oil and water, or the pre-mentioned ointment with water,
using at the same time the above-named invocations, that the persons referred to may become
incapable of being seized or seen by the principalities and powers, and that their inner man
<note type="footnote">278 The Latin reads zonis, “zones,” instead of “lives,” as in the Greek.</note>
<note type="footnote">279 Here, again, are many variations.</note>

<pb n="911"/>
may ascend on high in an invisible manner, as if their body were left among created things
in this world, while their soul is sent forward to the Demiurge. And they instruct them, on
their reaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these words: “I am a son from
the Father—the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I
have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although,
strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature,
and made these things for herself. For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I
come again to my own place whence I went forth.” And they affirm that, by saying these
things, he escapes from the powers. He then advances to the companions of the Demiurge,
and thus addresses them:—“I am a vessel more precious than the female who formed you.
If your mother is ignorant of her own descent, I know myself, and am aware whence I am,
and I call upon the incorruptible Sophia, who is in the Father, and is the mother of your
mother, who has no father, nor any male consort; but a female springing from a female
formed you, while ignorant of her own mother, and imagining that she alone existed; but I
call upon her mother.” And they declare, that when the companions of the Demiurge hear
these words, they are greatly agitated, and upbraid their origin and the race of their mother.
But he goes into his own place, having thrown [off] his chain, that is, his animal nature.
These, then, are the particulars which have reached us respecting “redemption.”280 But
since they differ so widely among themselves both as respects doctrine and tradition, and
since those of them who are recognised as being most modern make it their effort daily to
invent some new opinion, and to bring out what no one ever before thought of, it is a difficult
matter to describe all their opinions.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Deviations of heretics from the truth.</head>
<p>1. The rule281 of truth which we hold, is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all
things by His Word, and fashioned and formed, out of that which had no existence, all
things which exist. Thus saith the Scripture, to that effect: “By the Word of the Lord were
the heavens established, and all the might of them, by the spirit of His mouth.”282 And
again, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.”283 There is no
exception or deduction stated; but the Father made all things by Him, whether visible or
invisible, objects of sense or of intelligence, temporal, on account of a certain character
given them, or eternal; and these eternal284 things He did not make by angels, or by any
powers separated from His Ennoea. For God needs none of all these things, but is He who,
by His Word and Spirit, makes, and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all
things into existence,—He who formed the world (for the world is of all),—He who fashioned
man,—He [who]285 is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
above whom there is no other God, nor initial principle, nor power, nor pleroma,—He is
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we shall prove. Holding, therefore, this rule, we shall
easily show, notwithstanding the great variety and multitude of their opinions, that these
men have deviated from the truth; for almost all the different sects of heretics admit that
there is one God; but then, by their pernicious doctrines, they change [this truth into error],
even as the Gentiles do through idolatry,—thus proving themselves ungrateful to Him that
created them. Moreover, they despise the workmanship of God, speaking against their own
salvation, becoming their own bitterest accusers, and being false witnesses [against themselves].
Yet, reluctant as they may be, these men shall one day rise again in the flesh, to
confess the power of Him who raises them from the dead; but they shall not be numbered
among the righteous on account of their unbelief.</p>
<p>2. Since, therefore, it is a complex and multiform task to detect and convict all the
heretics, and since our design is to reply to them all according to their special characters,
we have judged it necessary, first of all, to give an account of their source and root, in order
that, by getting a knowledge of their most exalted Bythus, thou mayest understand the nature
of the tree which has produced such fruits.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Doctrines and practices of Simon Magus and Menander.</head>
<p>1. Simon the Samaritan was that magician of whom Luke, the disciple and follower of
the apostles, says, “But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime used magical
arts in that city, and led astray the people of Samaria, declaring that he himself was
some great one, to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This is
the power of God, which is called great. And to him they had regard, because that of long
time he had driven them mad by his sorceries.”286 This Simon, then—who feigned faith,
supposing that the apostles themselves performed their cures by the art of magic, and not
by the power of God; and with respect to their filling with the Holy Ghost, through the imposition
of hands, those that believed in God through Him who was preached by them,
namely, Christ Jesus—suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge
of magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might receive this power of
bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he would,—was addressed in these words by
Peter: “Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be
purchased with money: thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not
right in the sight of God; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond
of iniquity.”287 He, then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to
contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to be a wonderful being,
and applied himself with still greater zeal to the study of the whole magic art, that he might
the better bewilder and overpower multitudes of men. Such was his procedure in the reign
of Claudius Cæsar, by whom also he is said to have been honoured with a statue, on account
of his magical power.288 This man, then, was glorified by many as if he were a god; and he
taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria
as the Father while he came to other nations in the character of the Holy Spirit. He represented
himself, in a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that is, the Being who is the
Father over all, and he allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title men were pleased to
address him.</p>
<p>2. Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all sorts of heresies derive their origin, formed
his sect out of the following materials:—Having redeemed from slavery at Tyre, a city of
Phoenicia, a certain woman named Helena, he was in the habit of carrying her about with
him, declaring that this woman was the first conception of his mind, the mother of all, by
whom, in the beginning, he conceived in his mind [the thought] of forming angels and

<pb n="914"/>
archangels. For this Ennoea leaping forth from him, and comprehending the will of her
father, descended to the lower regions [of space], and generated angels and powers, by whom
also he declared this world was formed. But after she had produced them, she was detained
by them through motives of jealousy, because they were unwilling to be looked upon as the
progeny of any other being. As to himself, they had no knowledge of him whatever; but his
Ennoea was detained by those powers and angels who had been produced by her. She suffered
all kinds of contumely from them, so that she could not return upwards to her father, but
was even shut up in a human body, and for ages passed in succession from one female body
to another, as from vessel to vessel. She was, for example, in that Helen on whose account
the Trojan war was undertaken; for whose sake also Stesichorus289 was struck blind, because
he had cursed her in his verses, but afterwards, repenting and writing what are called palinodes,
in which he sang her praise, he was restored to sight. Thus she, passing from body to
body, and suffering insults in every one of them, at last became a common prostitute; and
she it was that was meant by the lost sheep.290</p>
<p>3. For this purpose, then, he had come that he might win her first, and free her from
slavery, while he conferred salvation upon men, by making himself known to them. For
since the angels ruled the world ill because each one of them coveted the principal power
for himself, he had come to amend matters, and had descended, transfigured and assimilated
to powers and principalities and angels, so that he might appear among men to be a man,
while yet he was not a man; and that thus he was thought to have suffered in Judæa, when
he had not suffered. Moreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the inspiration
of those angels who formed the world; for which reason those who place their trust in him
and Helena no longer regarded them, but, as being free, live as they please; for men are saved
through his grace, and not on account of their own righteous actions. For such deeds are
not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere accident, just as those angels who made
the world, have thought fit to constitute them, seeking, by means of such precepts, to bring
men into bondage. On this account, he pledged himself that the world should be dissolved,
and that those who are his should be freed from the rule of them who made the world.</p>
<p>4. Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both lead profligate lives and
practise magical arts, each one to the extent of his ability. They use exorcisms and incantations.
Love-potions, too, and charms, as well as those beings who are called “Paredri” (familiars)
and “Oniropompi” (dream-senders), and whatever other curious arts can be had recourse
to, are eagerly pressed into their service. They also have an image of Simon fashioned
after the likeness of Jupiter, and another of Helena in the shape of Minerva; and these they
worship. In fine, they have a name derived from Simon, the author of these most impious

doctrines, being called Simonians; and from them “knowledge, falsely so called,”291 received
its beginning, as one may learn even from their own assertions.</p>
<p>5. The successor of this man was Menander, also a Samaritan by birth, and he, too, was
a perfect adept in the practice of magic. He affirms that the primary Power continues unknown
to all, but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence
of the invisible beings as a saviour, for the deliverance of men. The world was made by angels,
whom, like Simon, he maintains to have been produced by Ennoea. He gives, too, as he affirms,
by means of that magic which he teaches, knowledge to this effect, that one may
overcome those very angels that made the world; for his disciples obtain the resurrection by
being baptized into him, and can die no more, but remain in the possession of immortal
youth.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Doctrines of Saturninus and Basilides.</head>
<p>1. Arising among these men, Saturninus (who was of that Antioch which is near Daphne)
and Basilides laid hold of some favourable opportunities, and promulgated different systems
of doctrine—the one in Syria, the other at Alexandria. Saturninus, like Menander, set forth
one father unknown to all, who made angels, archangels, powers, and potentates. The world,
again, and all things therein, were made by a certain company of seven angels. Man, too,
was the workmanship of angels, a shining image bursting forth below from the presence of
the supreme power; and when they could not, he says, keep hold of this, because it immediately
darted upwards again, they exhorted each other, saying, “Let us make man after our
image and likeness.”292 He was accordingly formed, yet was unable to stand erect, through
the inability of the angels to convey to him that power, but wriggled [on the ground] like a
worm. Then the power above taking pity upon him, since he was made after his likeness,
sent forth a spark of life, which gave man an erect posture, compacted his joints, and made
him live. He declares, therefore, that this spark of life, after the death of a man, returns to
those things which are of the same nature with itself, and the rest of the body is decomposed
into its original elements.</p>
<p>2. He has also laid it down as a truth, that the Saviour was without birth, without body,
and without figure, but was, by supposition, a visible man; and he maintained that the God
of the Jews was one of the angels; and, on this account, because all the powers wished to
annihilate his father, Christ came to destroy the God of the Jews, but to save such as believe
in him; that is, those who possess the spark of his life. This heretic was the first to affirm
that two kinds of men were formed by the angels,—the one wicked, and the other good.
And since the demons assist the most wicked, the Saviour came for the destruction of evil
men and of the demons, but for the salvation of the good. They declare also, that marriage
and generation are from Satan.293 Many of those, too, who belong to his school, abstain
from animal food, and draw away multitudes by a feigned temperance of this kind. They
hold, moreover, that some of the prophecies were uttered by those angels who made the
world, and some by Satan; whom Saturninus represents as being himself an angel, the enemy
of the creators of the world, but especially of the God of the Jews.</p>
<p>3. Basilides again, that he may appear to have discovered something more sublime and
plausible, gives an immense development to his doctrines. He sets forth that Nous was first
born of the unborn father, that from him, again, was born Logos, from Logos Phronesis,
from Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis and Sophia the powers, and
principalities, and angels, whom he also calls the first; and that by them the first heaven was
made. Then other powers, being formed by emanation from these, created another heaven
<note type="footnote">292 Gen. i. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">293 [1 Tim. iv. 3.]</note>

<pb n="917"/>
similar to the first; and in like manner, when others, again, had been formed by emanation
from them, corresponding exactly to those above them, these, too, framed another third
heaven; and then from this third, in downward order, there was a fourth succession of descendants;
and so on, after the same fashion, they declare that more and more principalities
and angels were formed, and three hundred and sixty-five heavens.294 Wherefore the year
contains the same number of days in conformity with the number of the heavens.</p>
<p>4. Those angels who occupy the lowest heaven, that, namely, which is visible to us,
formed all the things which are in the world, and made allotments among themselves of the
earth and of those nations which are upon it. The chief of them is he who is thought to be
the God of the Jews; and inasmuch as he desired to render the other nations subject to his
own people, that is, the Jews, all the other princes resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all
other nations were at enmity with his nation. But the father without birth and without name,
perceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous (he it is who is
called Christ) to bestow deliverance on them that believe in him, from the power of those
who made the world. He appeared, then, on earth as a man, to the nations of these powers,
and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man
of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured
by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error,
while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since
he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured
himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch
as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who know these things
have been freed from the principalities who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent
on us to confess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was
thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the father, that by this dispensation
he might destroy the works of the makers of the world. If any one, therefore, he declares,
confesses the crucified, that man is still a slave, and under the power of those who formed
our bodies; but he who denies him has been freed from these beings, and is acquainted with
the dispensation of the unborn father.</p>
<p>5. Salvation belongs to the soul alone, for the body is by nature subject to corruption.
He declares, too, that the prophecies were derived from those powers who were the makers
of the world, but the law was specially given by their chief, who led the people out of the
land of Egypt. He attaches no importance to [the question regarding] meats offered in sacrifice
to idols, thinks them of no consequence, and makes use of them without any hesitation;
he holds also the use of other things, and the practice of every kind of lust, a matter of perfect
indifference. These men, moreover, practise magic; and use images, incantations, invocations,
<note type="footnote">294 The ordinary text reads, “three hundred and seventy-five,” but it should manifestly be corrected as above.</note>

<pb n="918"/>
and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of the
angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the first, and others to the second
heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names, principles, angels, and powers of the
three hundred and sixty-five imagined heavens. They also affirm that the barbarous name
in which the Saviour ascended and descended, is Caulacau.295</p>
<p>6. He, then, who has learned [these things], and known all the angels and their causes,
is rendered invisible and incomprehensible to the angels and all the powers, even as Caulacau
also was. And as the son was unknown to all, so must they also be known by no one; but
while they know all, and pass through all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown
to all; for, “Do thou,” they say, “know all, but let nobody know thee.” For this reason, persons
of such a persuasion are also ready to recant [their opinions], yea, rather, it is impossible
that they should suffer on account of a mere name, since they are like to all. The multitude,
however, cannot understand these matters, but only one out of a thousand, or two out of
ten thousand. They declare that they are no longer Jews, and that they are not yet Christians;
and that it is not at all fitting to speak openly of their mysteries, but right to keep them secret
by preserving silence.</p>
<p>7. They make out the local position of the three hundred and sixty-five heavens in the
same way as do mathematicians. For, accepting the theorems of these latter, they have
transferred them to their own type of doctrine. They hold that their chief is Abraxas;296
and, on this account, that word contains in itself the numbers amounting to three hundred
and sixty-five.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Doctrines of Carpocrates.</head>
<p>1. Carpocrates, again, and his followers maintain that the world and the things which
are therein were created by angels greatly inferior to the unbegotten Father. They also hold
that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he
differed from them in this respect, that inasmuch as his soul was stedfast and pure, he perfectly
remembered those things which he had witnessed297 within the sphere of the unbegotten
God. On this account, a power descended upon him from the Father, that by means
of it he might escape from the creators of the world; and they say that it, after passing through
them all, and remaining in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the powers,298
which in the same way embraced like things to itself. They further declare, that the soul of
Jesus, although educated in the practices of the Jews, regarded these with contempt, and
that for this reason he was endowed with faculties, by means of which he destroyed those
passions which dwelt in men as a punishment [for their sins].</p>
<p>2. The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ can despise those rulers who were the
creators of the world, and, in like manner, receives power for accomplishing the same results.
This idea has raised them to such a pitch of pride, that some of them declare themselves
similar to Jesus; while others, still more mighty, maintain that they are superior to his disciples,
such as Peter and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no
respect inferior to Jesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as his, and
therefore despising in like manner the creators of the world, are deemed worthy of the same
power, and again depart to the same place. But if any one shall have despised the things in
this world more than he did, he thus proves himself superior to him.</p>
<p>3. They practise also magical arts and incantations; philters, also, and love-potions; and
have recourse to familiar spirits, dream-sending demons, and other abominations, declaring
that they possess power to rule over, even now, the princes and formers of this world; and
not only them, but also all things that are in it. These men, even as the Gentiles, have been
sent forth by Satan299 to bring dishonour upon the Church, so that, in one way or another,
men hearing the things which they speak, and imagining that we all are such as they, may
turn away their ears from the preaching of the truth; or, again, seeing the things they practise,
may speak evil of us all, who have in fact no fellowship with them, either in doctrine or in
morals, or in our daily conduct. But they lead a licentious life,300 and, to conceal their impious
doctrines, they abuse the name [of Christ], as a means of hiding their wickedness; so that

“their condemnation is just,”301 when they receive from God a recompense suited to their
works.</p>
<p>4. So unbridled is their madness, that they declare they have in their power all things
which are irreligious and impious, and are at liberty to practise them; for they maintain that
things are evil or good, simply in virtue of human opinion.302 They deem it necessary,
therefore, that by means of transmigration from body to body, souls should have experience
of every kind of life as well as every kind of action (unless, indeed, by a single incarnation,
one may be able to prevent any need for others, by once for all, and with equal completeness,
doing all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of, nay, which we must not
even conceive in our thoughts, nor think credible, if any such thing is mooted among those
persons who are our fellow-citizens), in order that, as their writings express it, their souls,
having made trial of every kind of life, may, at their departure, not be wanting in any particular.
It is necessary303 to insist upon this, lest, on account of some one thing being still
wanting to their deliverance, they should be compelled once more to become incarnate.
They affirm that for this reason Jesus spoke the following parable:—“Whilst thou art with
thine adversary in the way, give all diligence, that thou mayest be delivered from him, lest
he give thee up to the judge, and the judge surrender thee to the officer, and he cast thee
into prison. Verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last
farthing.”304 They also declare the “adversary” is one of those angels who are in the world,
whom they call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that he might
lead those souls which have perished from the world to the Supreme Ruler. They describe
him also as being chief among the makers of the world, and maintain that he delivers such
souls [as have been mentioned] to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut
them up in other bodies; for they declare that the body is “the prison.” Again, they interpret
these expressions, “Thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing,” as
meaning that no one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but
that he must pass from body to body, until he has experience of every kind of action which
can be practised in this world, and when nothing is longer wanting to him, then his liberated
soul should soar upwards to that God who is above the angels, the makers of the world. In
this way also all souls are saved, whether their own which, guarding against all delay, participate
in all sorts of actions during one incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from
body to body, are set free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every form

of life into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no longer be [shut up] in the
body.</p>
<p>5. And thus, if ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden actions are committed among them,
I can no longer find ground for believing them to be such.305 And in their writings we read
as follows, the interpretation which they give [of their views], declaring that Jesus spoke in
a mystery to His disciples and apostles privately, and that they requested and obtained permission
to hand down the things thus taught them, to others who should be worthy and
believing. We are saved, indeed, by means of faith and love; but all other things, while in
their nature indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men—some good and some evil,
there being nothing really evil by nature.</p>
<p>6. Others of them employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of
the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate
of] Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style
themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed
from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by
Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them.306 They crown these images, and set them
up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of
Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring
these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Doctrines of Cerinthus, the Ebionites, and Nicolaitanes.</head>
<p>1. Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated307 in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught
that the world was not made by the primary God, but by a certain Power far separated from
him, and at a distance from that Principality who is supreme over the universe, and ignorant
of him who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as
being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human generation,
while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover,
after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler,
and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed miracles. But at last Christ
departed from Jesus, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained
impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.</p>
<p>2. Those who are called Ebionites agree that the world was made by God; but their
opinions with respect to the Lord are similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They
use the Gospel according to Matthew only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining
that he was an apostate from the law. As to the prophetical writings, they endeavour to expound
them in a somewhat singular manner: they practise circumcision, persevere in the
observance of those customs which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style
of life, that they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.</p>
<p>3. The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained
to the diaconate by the apostles.308 They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The
character of these men is very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they
are represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise adultery, and to
eat things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore the Word has also spoken of them thus: “But this
thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.”309</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Doctrines of Cerdo and Marcion.</head>
<p>1. Cerdo was one who took his system from the followers of Simon, and came to live at
Rome in the time of Hyginus, who held the ninth place in the episcopal succession from
the apostles downwards. He taught that the God proclaimed by the law and the prophets
was not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the former was known, but the latter unknown;
while the one also was righteous, but the other benevolent.</p>
<p>2. Marcion of Pontus succeeded him, and developed his doctrine. In so doing, he advanced
the most daring blasphemy against Him who is proclaimed as God by the law and
the prophets, declaring Him to be the author of evils, to take delight in war, to be infirm of
purpose, and even to be contrary to Himself. But Jesus being derived from that father who
is above the God that made the world, and coming into Judæa in the times of Pontius Pilate
the governor, who was the procurator of Tiberius Cæsar, was manifested in the form of a
man to those who were in Judæa, abolishing the prophets and the law, and all the works of
that God who made the world, whom also he calls Cosmocrator. Besides this, he mutilates
the Gospel which is according to Luke, removing all that is written respecting the generation
of the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the Lord, in which the Lord is
recorded as most dearly confessing that the Maker of this universe is His Father. He likewise
persuaded his disciples that he himself was more worthy of credit than are those apostles
who have handed down the Gospel to us, furnishing them not with the Gospel, but merely
a fragment of it. In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of Paul, removing all that
is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the world, to the effect that He is the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also those passages from the prophetical writings which
the apostle quotes, in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the
Lord.</p>
<p>3. Salvation will be the attainment only of those souls which had learned his doctrine;
while the body, as having been taken from the earth, is incapable of sharing in salvation. In
addition to his blasphemy against God Himself, he advanced this also, truly speaking as
with the mouth of the devil, and saying all things in direct opposition to the truth,—that
Cain, and those like him, and the Sodomites, and the Egyptians, and others like them, and,
in fine, all the nations who walked in all sorts of abomination, were saved by the Lord, on
His descending into Hades, and on their running unto Him, and that they welcomed Him
into their kingdom. But the serpent310 which was in Marcion declared that Abel, and Enoch,
and Noah, and those other righteous men who sprang311 from the patriarch Abraham, with
all the prophets, and those who were pleasing to God, did not partake in salvation. For since
these men, he says, knew that their God was constantly tempting them, so now they suspected
<note type="footnote">310 [Comp. cap. xxv. 3.]</note>
<note type="footnote">311 We here follow the amended version proposed by the Benedictine editor.</note>

<pb n="924"/>
that He was tempting them, and did not run to Jesus, or believe His announcement: and
for this reason he declared that their souls remained in Hades.</p>
<p>4. But since this man is the only one who has dared openly to mutilate the Scriptures,
and unblushingly above all others to inveigh against God, I purpose specially to refute him,
convicting him out of his own writings; and, with the help of God, I shall overthrow him
out of those312 discourses of the Lord and the apostles, which are of authority with him,
and of which he makes use. At present, however, I have simply been led to mention him,
that thou mightest know that all those who in any way corrupt the truth, and injuriously
affect the preaching of the Church, are the disciples and successors of Simon Magus of
Samaria. Although they do not confess the name of their master, in order all the more to
seduce others, yet they do teach his doctrines. They set forth, indeed, the name of Christ
Jesus as a sort of lure, but in various ways they introduce the impieties of Simon; and thus
they destroy multitudes, wickedly disseminating their own doctrines by the use of a good
name, and, through means of its sweetness and beauty, extending to their hearers the bitter
and malignant poison of the serpent, the great author of apostasy.313</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Doctrines of Tatian, the Encratites, and others.</head>
<p>1. Many offshoots of numerous heresies have already been formed from those heretics
we have described. This arises from the fact that numbers of them—indeed, we may say
all—desire themselves to be teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy in which
they have been involved. Forming one set of doctrines out of a totally different system of
opinions, and then again others from others, they insist upon teaching something new, declaring
themselves the inventors of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to
call into existence. To give an example: Springing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who
are called Encratites (self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting aside the original
creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male and female for the
propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned among them have also introduced
abstinence from animal food, thus proving themselves ungrateful to God, who formed all
things. They deny, too, the salvation of him who was first created. It is but lately, however,
that this opinion has been invented among them. A certain man named Tatian first introduced
the blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin’s, and as long as he continued with him he
expressed no such views; but after his martyrdom he separated from the Church, and, excited
and puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed
his own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of certain invisible Æons, like the
followers of Valentinus; while, like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was
nothing else than corruption and fornication.314 But his denial of Adam’s salvation was an
opinion due entirely to himself.</p>
<p>2. Others, again, following upon Basilides and Carpocrates, have introduced promiscuous
intercourse and a plurality of wives, and are indifferent about eating meats sacrificed to
idols, maintaining that God does not greatly regard such matters. But why continue? For it
is an impracticable attempt to mention all those who, in one way or another, have fallen
away from the truth.</p>

<pb n="926"/>
<head>Chapter XXIX.—Doctrines of various other Gnostic sects, and especially of the
Barbeliotes or Borborians.</head>
<p>1. Besides those, however, among these heretics who are Simonians, and of whom we
have already spoken, a multitude of Gnostics have sprung up, and have been manifested
like mushrooms growing out of the ground. I now proceed to describe the principal opinions
held by them. Some of them, then, set forth a certain Æon who never grows old, and exists
in a virgin spirit: him they style Barbelos.315 They declare that somewhere or other there
exists a certain father who cannot be named, and that he was desirous to reveal himself to
this Barbelos. Then this Ennoea went forward, stood before his face, and demanded from
him Prognosis (prescience). But when Prognosis had, [as was requested,] come forth, these
two asked for Aphtharsia (incorruption), which also came forth, and after that Zoe Aionios
(eternal life). Barbelos, glorying in these, and contemplating their greatness, and in conception316
[thus formed], rejoicing in this greatness, generated light similar to it. They declare
that this was the beginning both of light and of the generation of all things; and that the
Father, beholding this light, anointed it with his own benignity, that it might be rendered
perfect. Moreover, they maintain that this was Christ, who again, according to them, requested
that Nous should be given him as an assistant; and Nous came forth accordingly. Besides
these, the Father sent forth Logos. The conjunctions of Ennoea and Logos, and of Aphtharsia
and Christ, will thus be formed; while Zoe Aionios was united to Thelema, and Nous to
Prognosis. These, then, magnified the great light and Barbelos.</p>
<p>2. They also affirm that Autogenes was afterwards sent forth from Ennoea and Logos,
to be a representation of the great light, and that he was greatly honoured, all things being
rendered subject unto him. Along with him was sent forth Aletheia, and a conjunction was
formed between Autogenes and Aletheia. But they declare that from the Light, which is
Christ, and from Aphtharsia, four luminaries were sent forth to surround Autogenes; and
again from Thelema and Zoe Aionios four other emissions took place, to wait upon these
four luminaries; and these they name Charis (grace), Thelesis (will), Synesis (understanding),
and Phronesis (prudence). Of these, Charis is connected with the great and first luminary:
him they represent as Soter (Saviour), and style Armogenes.317 Thelesis, again, is united to
the second luminary, whom they also name Raguel; Synesis to the third, whom they call
David; and Phronesis to the fourth, whom they name Eleleth.</p>
<note type="footnote">315 Harvey supposes this name to be derived from two Syriac words, meaning “God in a Tetrad.” Matter
again derives it from two Hebrew words, denoting “Daughter of the Lord.”</note>
<note type="footnote">316 Both the text and meaning are here altogether doubtful.</note>
<note type="footnote">317 Harvey refers to the cabbalistic books in explanation of this and the following names, but their meanings
are very uncertain.</note>

<pb n="927"/>
<p>3. All these, then, being thus settled, Autogenes moreover produces a perfect and true
man, whom they also call Adamas, inasmuch as neither has he himself ever been conquered,
nor have those from whom he sprang; he also was, along with the first light, severed from
Armogenes. Moreover, perfect knowledge was sent forth by Autogenes along with man,
and was united to him; hence he attained to the knowledge of him that is above all. Invincible
power was also conferred on him by the virgin spirit; and all things then rested in him, to
sing praises to the great Æon. Hence also they declare were manifested the mother, the
father, the son; while from Anthropos and Gnosis that Tree was produced which they also
style Gnosis itself.</p>
<p>4. Next they maintain, that from the first angel, who stands by the side of Monogenes,
the Holy Spirit has been sent forth, whom they also term Sophia and Prunicus.318 He then,
perceiving that all the others had consorts, while he himself was destitute of one, searched
after a being to whom he might be united; and not finding one, he exerted and extended
himself to the uttermost and looked down into the lower regions, in the expectation of there
finding a consort; and still not meeting with one, he leaped forth [from his place] in a state
of great impatience, [which had come upon him] because he had made his attempt without
the good-will of his father. Afterwards, under the influence of simplicity and kindness, he
produced a work in which were to be found ignorance and audacity. This work of his they
declare to be Protarchontes, the former of this [lower] creation. But they relate that a mighty
power carried him away from his mother, and that he settled far away from her in the lower
regions, and formed the firmament of heaven, in which also they affirm that he dwells. And
in his ignorance he formed those powers which are inferior to himself—angels, and firmaments,
and all things earthly. They affirm that he, being united to Authadia (audacity),
produced Kakia (wickedness), Zelos (emulation), Phthonos (envy), Erinnys (fury), and
Epithymia (lust). When these were generated, the mother Sophia deeply grieved, fled away,
departed into the upper regions, and became the last of the Ogdoad, reckoning it downwards.
On her thus departing, he imagined he was the only being in existence; and on this account
declared, “I am a jealous God, and besides me there is no one.”319 Such are the falsehoods
which these people invent.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Doctrines of the Ophites and Sethians.</head>
<p>1. Others, again, portentously declare that there exists, in the power of Bythus, a certain
primary light, blessed, incorruptible, and infinite: this is the Father of all, and is styled the
first man. They also maintain that his Ennoea, going forth from him, produced a son, and
that this is the son of man—the second man. Below these, again, is the Holy Spirit, and under
this superior spirit the elements were separated from each other, viz., water, darkness, the
abyss, chaos, above which they declare the Spirit was borne, calling him the first woman.
Afterwards, they maintain, the first man, with his son, delighting over the beauty of the
Spirit—that is, of the woman—and shedding light upon her, begat by her an incorruptible
light, the third male, whom they call Christ,—the son of the first and second man, and of
the Holy Spirit, the first woman.</p>
<p>2. The father and son thus both had intercourse with the woman (whom they also call
the mother of the living). When, however,320 she could not bear nor receive into herself the
greatness of the lights, they declare that she was filled to repletion, and became ebullient on
the left side; and that thus their only son Christ, as belonging to the right side, and ever
tending to what was higher, was immediately caught up with his mother to form an incorruptible
Æon. This constitutes the true and holy Church, which has become the appellation,
the meeting together, and the union of the father of all, of the first man, of the son, of the
second man, of Christ their son, and of the woman who has been mentioned.</p>
<p>3. They teach, however, that the power which proceeded from the woman by ebullition,
being besprinkled with light, fell downward from the place occupied by its progenitors, yet
possessing by its own will that besprinkling of light; and it they call Sinistra, Prunicus, and
Sophia, as well as masculo-feminine. This being, in its simplicity, descended into the waters
while they were yet in a state of immobility, and imparted motion to them also, wantonly
acting upon them even to their lowest depths, and assumed from them a body. For they affirm
that all things rushed towards and clung to that sprinkling of light, and begin it all round.
Unless it had possessed that, it would perhaps have been totally absorbed in, and overwhelmed
by, material substance. Being therefore bound down by a body which was composed
of matter, and greatly burdened by it, this power regretted the course it had followed, and
made an attempt to escape from the waters and ascend to its mother: it could not effect this,
however, on account of the weight of the body lying over and around it. But feeling very ill
at ease, it endeavoured at least to conceal that light which came from above, fearing lest it
too might be injured by the inferior elements, as had happened to itself. And when it had
received power from that besprinkling of light which it possessed, it sprang back again, and
was borne aloft; and being on high, it extended itself, covered [a portion of space], and
formed this visible heaven out of its body; yet remained under the heaven which it made,

as still possessing the form of a watery body. But when it had conceived a desire for the light
above, and had received power by all things, it laid down this body, and was freed from it.
This body which they speak of that power as having thrown off, they call a female from a
female.</p>
<p>4. They declare, moreover, that her son had also himself a certain breath of incorruption
left him by his mother, and that through means of it he works; and becoming powerful, he
himself, as they affirm, also sent forth from the waters a son without a mother; for they do
not allow him either to have known a mother. His son, again, after the example of his father,
sent forth another son. This third one, too, generated a fourth; the fourth also generated a
son: they maintain that again a son was generated by the fifth; and the sixth, too, generated
a seventh. Thus was the Hebdomad, according to them, completed, the mother possessing
the eighth place; and as in the case of their generations, so also in regard to dignities and
powers, they precede each other in turn.</p>
<p>5. They have also given names to [the several persons] in their system of falsehood, such
as the following: he who was the first descendant of the mother is called Ialdabaoth;321 he,
again, descended from him, is named Iao; he, from this one, is called Sabaoth; the fourth is
named Adoneus; the fifth, Eloeus; the sixth, Oreus; and the seventh and last of all, Astanphæus.
Moreover, they represent these heavens, potentates, powers, angels, and creators,
as sitting in their proper order in heaven, according to their generation, and as invisibly
ruling over things celestial and terrestrial. The first of them, namely Ialdabaoth, holds his
mother in contempt, inasmuch as he produced sons and grandsons without the permission
of any one, yea, even angels, archangels, powers, potentates, and dominions. After these
things had been done, his sons turned to strive and quarrel with him about the supreme
power,—conduct which deeply grieved Ialdabaoth, and drove him to despair. In these circumstances,
he cast his eyes upon the subjacent dregs of matter, and fixed his desire upon
it, to which they declare his son owes his origin. This son is Nous himself, twisted into the
form of a serpent;322 and hence were derived the spirit, the soul, and all mundane things:
from this too were generated all oblivion, wickedness, emulation, envy, and death. They
declare that the father imparted323 still greater crookedness to this serpent-like and contorted
Nous of theirs, when he was with their father in heaven and Paradise.</p>
<p>6. On this account, Ialdabaoth, becoming uplifted in spirit, boasted himself over all
those things that were below him, and exclaimed, “I am father, and God, and above me there
<note type="footnote">321 The probable meaning of this and the following names is thus given by Harvey: Ialdabaoth, Lord God of
the Fathers; Iao, Jehovah; Oreus, Light; Astanphæus, Crown; Sabaoth, of course, means Hosts; Adoneus, Lord;
and Eloeus, God. All the names are derived from the cabbalistic theology of the Jews.</note>

is no one.” But his mother, hearing him speak thus, cried out against him, “Do not lie,
Ialdabaoth: for the father of all, the first Anthropos (man), is above thee; and so is Anthropos
the son of Anthropos.” Then, as all were disturbed by this new voice, and by the unexpected
proclamation, and as they were inquiring whence the noise proceeded, in order to lead them
away and attract them to himself, they affirm that Ialdabaoth exclaimed, “Come, let us make
man after our image.”324 The six powers, on hearing this, and their mother furnishing them
with the idea of a man (in order that by means of him she might empty them of their original
power), jointly formed a man of immense size, both in regard to breadth and length. But as
he could merely writhe along the ground, they carried him to their father; Sophia so labouring
in this matter, that she might empty him (Ialdabaoth) of the light with which he had been
sprinkled, so that he might no longer, though still powerful, be able to lift up himself against
the powers above. They declare, then, that by breathing into man the spirit of life, he was
secretly emptied of his power; that hence man became a possessor of nous (intelligence)
and enthymesis (thought); and they affirm that these are the faculties which partake in salvation.
He [they further assert] at once gave thanks to the first Anthropos (man), forsaking
those who had created him.</p>
<p>7. But Ialdabaoth, feeling envious at this, was pleased to form the design of again
emptying man by means of woman, and produced a woman from his own enthymesis,
whom that Prunicus [above mentioned] laying hold of, imperceptibly emptied her of power.
But the others coming and admiring her beauty, named her Eve, and falling in love with
her, begat sons by her, whom they also declare to be the angels. But their mother (Sophia)
cunningly devised a scheme to seduce Eve and Adam, by means of the serpent, to transgress
the command of Ialdabaoth. Eve listened to this as if it had proceeded from a son of God,
and yielded an easy belief. She also persuaded Adam to eat of the tree regarding which God
had said that they should not eat of it. They then declare that, on their thus eating, they attained
to the knowledge of that power which is above all, and departed from those who had
created them.325 When Prunicus perceived that the powers were thus baffled by their own
creature, she greatly rejoiced, and again cried out, that since the father was incorruptible,
he (Ialdabaoth) who formerly called himself the father was a liar; and that, while Anthropos
and the first woman (the Spirit) existed previously, this one (Eve) sinned by committing
adultery.</p>
<p>8. Ialdabaoth, however, through that oblivion in which he was involved, and not paying
any regard to these things, cast Adam and Eve out of Paradise, because they had transgressed
his commandment. For he had a desire to beget sons by Eve, but did not accomplish his
wish, because his mother opposed him in every point, and secretly emptied Adam and Eve
<note type="footnote">324 Gen. i. 26.</note>

<pb n="931"/>
of the light with which they had been sprinkled, in order that that spirit which proceeded
from the supreme power might participate neither in the curse nor opprobrium [caused by
transgression]. They also teach that, thus being emptied of the divine substance, they were
cursed by him, and cast down from heaven to this world.326 But the serpent also, who was
acting against the father, was cast down by him into this lower world; he reduced, however,
under his power the angels here, and begat six sons, he himself forming the seventh person,
after the example of that Hebdomad which surrounds the father. They further declare that
these are the seven mundane demons, who always oppose and resist the human race, because
it was on their account that their father was cast down to this lower world.</p>
<p>9. Adam and Eve previously had light, and clear, and as it were spiritual bodies, such
as they were at their creation; but when they came to this world, these changed into bodies
more opaque, and gross, and sluggish. Their soul also was feeble and languid, inasmuch as
they had received from their creator a merely mundane inspiration. This continued until
Prunicus, moved with compassion towards them, restored to them the sweet savour of the
besprinkling of light, by means of which they came to a remembrance of themselves, and
knew that they were naked, as well as that the body was a material substance, and thus recognised
that they bore death about with them. They thereupon became patient, knowing
that only for a time they would be enveloped in the body. They also found out food, through
the guidance of Sophia; and when they were satisfied, they had carnal knowledge of each
other, and begat Cain, whom the serpent, that had been cast down along with his sons, immediately
laid hold of and destroyed by filling him with mundane oblivion, and urging into
folly and audacity, so that, by slaying his brother Abel, he was the first to bring to light envy
and death. After these, they affirm that, by the forethought of Prunicus, Seth was begotten,
and then Norea,327 from whom they represent all the rest of mankind as being descended.
They were urged on to all kinds of wickedness by the inferior Hebdomad, and to apostasy,
idolatry, and a general contempt for everything by the superior holy Hebdomad,328 since
the mother was always secretly opposed to them, and carefully preserved what was peculiarly
her own, that is, the besprinkling of light. They maintain, moreover, that the holy Hebdomad
is the seven stars which they call planets; and they affirm that the serpent cast down has two
names, Michael and Samael.</p>
<p>10. Ialdabaoth, again, being incensed with men, because they did not worship or honour
him as father and God, sent forth a deluge upon them, that he might at once destroy them
all. But Sophia opposed him in this point also, and Noah and his family were saved in the
ark by means of the besprinkling of that light which proceeded from her, and through it the

world was again filled with mankind. Ialdabaoth himself chose a certain man named Abraham
from among these, and made a covenant with him, to the effect that, if his seed continued
to serve him, he would give to them the earth for an inheritance. Afterwards, by means of
Moses, he brought forth Abraham’s descendants from Egypt, and gave them the law, and
made them the Jews. Among that people he chose seven days,329 which they also call the
holy Hebdomad. Each of these receives his own herald for the purpose of glorifying and
proclaiming God; so that, when the rest hear these praises, they too may serve those who
are announced as gods by the prophets.</p>
<p>11. Moreover, they distribute the prophets in the following manner: Moses, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and Amos, and Habakkuk, belonged to Ialdabaoth; Samuel, and Nathan,
and Jonah, and Micah, to Iao; Elijah, Joel, and Zechariah to Sabaoth; Isaiah, Ezekiel,
Jeremiah, and Daniel, to Adonai; Tobias and Haggai to Eloi; Michaiah and Nahum to Oreus;
Esdras and Zephaniah to Astanphæus. Each one of these, then, glorifies his own father and
God, and they maintain that Sophia, herself has also spoken many things through them regarding
the first Anthropos (man),330 and concerning that Christ who is above, thus admonishing
and reminding men of the incorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of the descent
of Christ. The [other] powers being terrified by these things, and marvelling at the novelty
of those things which were announced by the prophets, Prunicus brought it about by means
of Ialdabaoth (who knew not what he did), that emissions of two men took place, the one
from the barren Elizabeth, and the other from the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>12. And since she herself had no rest either in heaven or on earth, she invoked her
mother to assist her in her distress. Upon this, her mother, the first woman, was moved with
compassion towards her daughter, on her repentance, and begged from the first man that
Christ should be sent to her assistance, who, being sent forth, descended to his sister, and
to the besprinkling of light. When he recognised her (that is, the Sophia below), her brother
descended to her, and announced his advent through means of John, and prepared the
baptism of repentance, and adopted Jesus beforehand, in order that on Christ descending
he might find a pure vessel, and that by the son of that Ialdabaoth the woman might be announced
by Christ. They further declare that he descended through the seven heavens,
having assumed the likeness of their sons, and gradually emptied them of their power. For
they maintain that the whole besprinkling of light rushed to him, and that Christ, descending
to this world, first clothed his sister Sophia [with it], and that then both exulted in the mu-

tual refreshment they felt in each other’s society: this scene they describe as relating to
bridegroom and bride. But Jesus, inasmuch as he was begotten of the Virgin through the
agency of God, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than all other men: Christ united to
Sophia descended into him, and thus Jesus Christ was produced.</p>
<p>13. They affirm that many of his disciples were not aware of the descent of Christ into
him; but that, when Christ did descend on Jesus, he then began to work miracles, and heal,
and announce the unknown Father, and openly to confess himself the son of the first man.
The powers and the father of Jesus were angry at these proceedings, and laboured to destroy
him; and when he was being led away for this purpose, they say that Christ himself, along
with Sophia, departed from him into the state of an incorruptible Æon, while Jesus was
crucified. Christ, however, was not forgetful of his Jesus, but sent down a certain energy
into him from above, which raised him up again in the body, which they call both animal
and spiritual; for he sent the mundane parts back again into the world. When his disciples
saw that he had risen, they did not recognise him—no, not even Jesus himself, by whom he
rose again from the dead. And they assert that this very great error prevailed among his
disciples, that they imagined he had risen in a mundane body, not knowing that “flesh331
and blood do not attain to the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>14. They strove to establish the descent and ascent of Christ, by the fact that neither
before his baptism, nor after his resurrection from the dead, do his disciples state that he
did any mighty works, not being aware that Jesus was united to Christ, and the incorruptible
Æon to the Hebdomad; and they declare his mundane body to be of the same nature as that
of animals. But after his resurrection he tarried [on earth] eighteen months; and knowledge
descending into him from above, he taught what was clear. He instructed a few of his disciples,
whom he knew to be capable of understanding so great mysteries, in these things,
and was then received up into heaven, Christ sitting down at the right hand of his father
Ialdabaoth, that he may receive to himself the souls of those who have known them,332 after
they have laid aside their mundane flesh, thus enriching himself without the knowledge or
perception of his father; so that, in proportion as Jesus enriches himself with holy souls, to
such an extent does his father suffer loss and is diminished, being emptied of his own power
by these souls. For he will not now possess holy souls to send them down again into the
world, except those only which are of his substance, that is, those into which he has breathed.
But the consummation [of all things] will take place, when the whole besprinkling of the
spirit of light is gathered together, and is carried off to form an incorruptible Æon.</p>

<p>15. Such are the opinions which prevail among these persons, by whom, like the Lernæan
hydra, a many-headed beast has been generated from the school of Valentinus. For some
of them assert that Sophia herself became the serpent; on which account she was hostile to
the creator of Adam, and implanted knowledge in men, for which reason the serpent was
called wiser than all others. Moreover, by the position of our intestines, through which the
food is conveyed, and by the fact that they possess such a figure, our internal configuration333
in the form of a serpent reveals our hidden generatrix.</p>

<p>1. Others again declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above, and acknowledge
that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such persons, are related to themselves. On
this account, they add, they have been assailed by the Creator, yet no one of them has suffered
injury. For Sophia was in the habit of carrying off that which belonged to her from them to
herself. They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things,
and that he alone, knowing the truth as no others did, accomplished the mystery of the betrayal;
by him all things, both earthly and heavenly, were thus thrown into confusion. They
produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the Gospel of Judas.</p>
<p>2. I have also made a collection of their writings in which they advocate the abolition
of the doings of Hystera.334 Moreover, they call this Hystera the creator of heaven and earth.
They also hold, like Carpocrates, that men cannot be saved until they have gone through
all kinds of experience. An angel, they maintain, attends them in every one of their sinful
and abominable actions, and urges them to venture on audacity and incur pollution.
Whatever may be the nature335 of the action, they declare that they do it in the name of the
angel, saying, “O thou angel, I use thy work; O thou power, I accomplish thy operation!”
And they maintain that this is “perfect knowledge,” without shrinking to rush into such
actions as it is not lawful even to name.</p>
<p>3. It was necessary clearly to prove, that, as their very opinions and regulations exhibit
them, those who are of the school of Valentinus derive their origin from such mothers,
fathers, and ancestors, and also to bring forward their doctrines, with the hope that perchance
some of them, exercising repentance and returning to the only Creator, and God the Former
of the universe, may obtain salvation, and that others may not henceforth be drawn away
by their wicked, although plausible, persuasions, imagining that they will obtain from them
the knowledge of some greater and more sublime mysteries. But let them rather, learning
to good effect from us the wicked tenets of these men, look with contempt upon their doctrines,
while at the same time they pity those who, still cleaving to these miserable and
baseless fables, have reached such a pitch of arrogance as to reckon themselves superior to
all others on account of such knowledge, or, as it should rather be called, ignorance. They
have now been fully exposed; and simply to exhibit their sentiments, is to obtain a victory
over them.</p>

ill-conditioned carcase of this miserable little fox.336 For there will not now be need of many

when, on a beast hiding itself in a wood, and by rushing forth from it is in the habit of destroying
multitudes, one who beats round the wood and thoroughly explores it, so as to
compel the animal to break cover, does not strive to capture it, seeing that it is truly a ferocious
beast; but those present can then watch and avoid its assaults, and can cast darts at it
from all sides, and wound it, and finally slay that destructive brute. So, in our case, since we
have brought their hidden mysteries, which they keep in silence among themselves, to the
light, it will not now be necessary to use many words in destroying their system of opinions.
For it is now in thy power, and in the power of all thy associates, to familiarize yourselves
with what has been said, to overthrow their wicked and undigested doctrines, and to set
forth doctrines agreeable to the truth. Since then the case is so, I shall, according to promise,
and as my ability serves, labour to overthrow them, by refuting them all in the following
book. Even to give an account of them is a tedious affair, as thou seest.337 But I shall furnish
means for overthrowing them, by meeting all their opinions in the order in which they have

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>1. In the first book, which immediately precedes this, exposing “knowledge falsely so
called,”338 I showed thee, my very dear friend, that the whole system devised, in many and
opposite ways, by those who are of the school of Valentinus, was false and baseless. I also
set forth the tenets of their predecessors, proving that they not only differed among themselves,
but had long previously swerved from the truth itself. I further explained, with all
diligence, the doctrine as well as practice of Marcus the magician, since he, too, belongs to
these persons; and I carefully noticed339 the passages which they garble from the Scriptures,
with the view of adapting them to their own fictions. Moreover, I minutely narrated the
manner in which, by means of numbers, and by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, they
boldly endeavour to establish [what they regard as] truth. I have also related how they think
and teach that creation at large was formed after the image of their invisible Pleroma, and
what they hold respecting the Demiurge, declaring at the same time the doctrine of Simon
Magus of Samaria, their progenitor, and of all those who succeeded him. I mentioned, too,
the multitude of those Gnostics who are sprung from him, and noticed340 the points of
difference between them, their several doctrines, and the order of their succession, while I
set forth all those heresies which have been originated by them. I showed, moreover, that
all these heretics, taking their rise from Simon, have introduced impious and irreligious
doctrines into this life; and I explained the nature of their “redemption,” and their method
of initiating those who are rendered “perfect,” along with their invocations and their mysteries.
I proved also that there is one God, the Creator, and that He is not the fruit of any
defect, nor is there anything either above Him, or after Him. In the present book, I shall
establish those points which fit in with my design, so far as time permits, and overthrow,
by means of lengthened treatment under distinct heads, their whole system; for which
reason, since it is an exposure and subversion of their opinions, I have so entitled the composition
of this work. For it is fitting, by a plain revelation and overthrow of their conjunctions,
to put an end to these hidden alliances,341 and to Bythus himself, and thus to obtain
a demonstration that he never existed at any previous time, nor now has any existence.</p>

<pb n="939"/>
<head>Chapter I.—There is but one God: the impossibility of its being otherwise.</head>
<p>1. It is proper, then, that I should begin with the first and most important head, that is,
God the Creator, who made the heaven and the earth, and all things that are therein (whom
these men blasphemously style the fruit of a defect), and to demonstrate that there is nothing
either above Him or after Him; nor that, influenced by any one, but of His own free will,
He created all things, since He is the only God, the only Lord, the only Creator, the only
Father, alone containing all things, and Himself commanding all things into existence.</p>
<p>2. For how can there be any other Fulness, or Principle, or Power, or God, above Him,
since it is matter of necessity that God, the Pleroma (Fulness) of all these, should contain
all things in His immensity, and should be contained by no one? But if there is anything
beyond Him, He is not then the Pleroma of all, nor does He contain all. For that which they
declare to be beyond Him will be wanting to the Pleroma, or, [in other words,] to that God
who is above all things. But that which is wanting, and falls in any way short, is not the
Pleroma of all things. In such a case, He would have both beginning, middle, and end, with
respect to those who are beyond Him. And if He has an end in regard to those things which
are below, He has also a beginning with respect to those things which are above. In like
manner, there is an absolute necessity that He should experience the very same thing at all
other points, and should be held in, bounded, and enclosed by those existences that are
outside of Him. For that being who is the end downwards, necessarily circumscribes and
surrounds him who finds his end in it. And thus, according to them, the Father of all (that
is, He whom they call Proön and Proarche), with their Pleroma, and the good God of Marcion,
is established and enclosed in some other, and is surrounded from without by another
mighty Being, who must of necessity be greater, inasmuch as that which contains is greater
than that which is contained. But then that which is greater is also stronger, and in a greater
degree Lord; and that which is greater, and stronger, and in a greater degree Lord—must
be God.</p>
<p>3. Now, since there exists, according to them, also something else which they declare
to be outside of the Pleroma, into which they further hold there descended that higher power
who went astray, it is in every way necessary that the Pleroma either contains that which is
beyond, yet is contained (for otherwise, it will not be beyond the Pleroma; for if there is
anything beyond the Pleroma, there will be a Pleroma within this very Pleroma which they
declare to be outside of the Pleroma, and the Pleroma will be contained by that which is
beyond: and with the Pleroma is understood also the first God); or, again, they must be an
infinite distance separated from each other —the Pleroma [I mean], and that which is beyond
it. But if they maintain this, there will then be a third kind of existence, which separates by
immensity the Pleroma and that which is beyond it. This third kind of existence will therefore
bound and contain both the others, and will be greater both than the Pleroma, and than
that which is beyond it, inasmuch as it contains both in its bosom. In this way, talk might

<pb n="940"/>
go on for ever concerning those things which are contained, and those which contain. For
if this third existence has its beginning above, and its end beneath, there is an absolute necessity
that it be also bounded on the sides, either beginning or ceasing at certain other
points, [where new existences begin.] These, again, and others which are above and below,
will have their beginnings at certain other points, and so on ad infinitum; so that their
thoughts would never rest in one God, but, in consequence of seeking after more than exists,
would wander away to that which has no existence, and depart from the true God.</p>
<p>4. These remarks are, in like manner, applicable against the followers of Marcion. For
his two gods will also be contained and circumscribed by an immense interval which separates
them from one another. But then there is a necessity to suppose a multitude of gods separated
by an immense distance from each other on every side, beginning with one another, and
ending in one another. Thus, by that very process of reasoning on which they depend for
teaching that there is a certain Pleroma or God above the Creator of heaven and earth, any
one who chooses to employ it may maintain that there is another Pleroma above the Pleroma,
above that again another, and above Bythus another ocean of Deity, while in like manner
the same successions hold with respect to the sides; and thus, their doctrine flowing out into
immensity, there will always be a necessity to conceive of other Pleroma, and other Bythi,
so as never at any time to stop, but always to continue seeking for others besides those
already mentioned. Moreover, it will be uncertain whether these which we conceive of are
below, or are, in fact, themselves the things which are above; and, in like manner, [it will be
doubtful] respecting those things which are said by them to be above, whether they are really
above or below; and thus our opinions will have no fixed conclusion or certainty, but will
of necessity wander forth after worlds without limits, and gods that cannot be numbered.</p>
<p>5. These things, then, being so, each deity will be contented with his own possessions,
and will not be moved with any curiosity respecting the affairs of others; otherwise he would
be unjust, and rapacious, and would cease to be what God is. Each creation, too, will glorify
its own maker, and will be contented with him, not knowing any other; otherwise it would
most justly be deemed an apostate by all the others, and would receive a richly-deserved
punishment. For it must be either that there is one Being who contains all things, and formed
in His own territory all those things which have been created, according to His own will;
or, again, that there are numerous unlimited creators and gods, who begin from each other,
and end in each other on every side; and it will then be necessary to allow that all the rest
are contained from without by some one who is greater, and that they are each of them shut
up within their own territory, and remain in it. No one of them all, therefore, is God. For
there will be [much] wanting to every one of them, possessing [as he will do] only a very
small part when compared with all the rest. The name of the Omnipotent will thus be brought
to an end, and such an opinion will of necessity fall to impiety.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The world was not formed by angels, or by any other being, contrary
to the will of the most high God, but was made by the Father through the Word.342</head>
<p>1. Those, moreover, who say that the world was formed by angels, or by any other maker
of it, contrary to the will of Him who is the Supreme Father, err first of all in this very point,
that they maintain that angels formed such and so mighty a creation, contrary to the will
of the Most High God. This would imply that angels were more powerful than God; or if
not so, that He was either careless, or inferior, or paid no regard to those things which took
place among His own possessions, whether they turned out ill or well, so that He might
drive away and prevent the one, while He praised and rejoiced over the other. But if one
would not ascribe such conduct even to a man of any ability, how much less to God?</p>
<p>2. Next let them tell us whether these things have been formed within the limits which
are contained by Him, and in His proper territory, or in regions belonging to others, and
lying beyond Him? But if they say [that these things were done] beyond Him, then all the
absurdities already mentioned will face them, and the Supreme God will be enclosed by that
which is beyond Him, in which also it will be necessary that He should find His end. If, on
the other hand, [these things were done] within His own proper territory, it will be very idle
to say that the world was thus formed within His proper territory against His will by angels
who are themselves under His power, or by any other being, as if either He Himself did not
behold all things which take place among His own possessions, or343 was not aware of the
things to be done by angels.</p>
<p>3. If, however, [the things referred to were done] not against His will, but with His
concurrence and knowledge, as some [of these men] think, the angels, or the Former of the
world [whoever that may have been], will no longer be the causes of that formation, but the
will of God. For if He is the Former of the world, He too made the angels, or at least was the
cause of their creation; and He will be regarded as having made the world who prepared
the causes of its formation. Although they maintain that the angels were made by a long
succession downwards, or that the Former of the world [sprang] from the Supreme Father,
as Basilides asserts; nevertheless that which is the cause of those things which have been
made will still be traced to Him who was the Author of such a succession. [The case stands]
just as regards success in war, which is ascribed to the king who prepared those things which
are the cause of victory; and, in like manner, the creation of any state, or of any work, is referred
to him who prepared materials for the accomplishment of those results which were
afterwards brought about. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the axe which cut the wood,
or the saw which divided it; but one would very properly say that the man cut and divided
it who formed the axe and the saw for this purpose, and [who also formed] at a much
<note type="footnote">342 [This noble chapter is a sort of homily on Heb. i.]</note>
<note type="footnote">343 The common text has “ut:” we prefer to read “aut” with Erasmus and others.</note>

<pb n="942"/>
earlier date all the tools by which the axe and the saw themselves were formed. With justice,
therefore, according to an analogous process of reasoning, the Father of all will be declared
the Former of this world, and not the angels, nor any other [so-called] former of the world,
other than He who was its Author, and had formerly344 been the cause of the preparation
for a creation of this kind.</p>
<p>4. This manner of speech may perhaps be plausible or persuasive to those who know
not God, and who liken Him to needy human beings, and to those who cannot immediately
and without assistance form anything, but require many instrumentalities to produce what
they intend. But it will not be regarded as at all probable by those who know that God stands
in need of nothing, and that He created and made all things by His Word, while He neither
required angels to assist Him in the production of those things which are made, nor of any
power greatly inferior to Himself, and ignorant of the Father, nor of any defect or ignorance,
in order that he who should know Him might become man.345 But He Himself in Himself,
after a fashion which we can neither describe nor conceive, predestinating all things, formed
them as He pleased, bestowing harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place,
and the beginning of their creation. In this way He conferred on spiritual things a spiritual
and invisible nature, on super-celestial things a celestial, on angels an angelical, on animals
an animal, on beings that swim a nature suited to the water, and on those that live on the
land one fitted for the land—on all, in short, a nature suitable to the character of the life
assigned them—while He formed all things that were made by His Word that never wearies.</p>
<p>5. For this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of God, not to stand in need of other instruments
for the creation of those things which are summoned into existence. His own
Word is both suitable and sufficient for the formation of all things, even as John, the disciple
of the Lord, declares regarding Him: “All things were made by Him, and without Him was
nothing made.”346 Now, among the “all things” our world must be embraced. It too, therefore,
was made by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made all
things connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses the same truth [when
he says] “For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.”347
Whom, therefore, shall we believe as to the creation of the world—these heretics who have
been mentioned that prate so foolishly and inconsistently on the subject, or the disciples of
the Lord, and Moses, who was both a faithful servant of God and a prophet? He at first

<p>Now, that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the apostle also has declared,
[saying,] “There is one God, the Father, who is above all, and through all things, and
in us all.”349 I have indeed proved already that there is only one God; but I shall further
demonstrate this from the apostles themselves, and from the discourses of the Lord. For
what sort of conduct would it be, were we to forsake the utterances of the prophets, of the
Lord, and of the apostles, that we might give heed to these persons, who speak not a word
of sense?</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Bythus and Pleroma of the Valentinians, as well as the God
of Marcion, shown to be absurd; the world was actually created by the same Being
who had conceived the idea of it, and was not the fruit of defect or ignorance.</head>
<p>1. The Bythus, therefore, whom they conceive of with his Pleroma, and the God of
Marcion, are inconsistent. If indeed, as they affirm, he has something subjacent and beyond
himself, which they style vacuity and shadow, this vacuum is then proved to be greater than
their Pleroma. But it is inconsistent even to make this statement, that while he contains all
things within himself, the creation was formed by some other. For it is absolutely necessary
that they acknowledge a certain void and chaotic kind of existence (below the spiritual
Pleroma) in which this universe was formed, and that the Propator purposely left this chaos
as it was,350 either knowing beforehand what things were to happen in it, or being ignorant
of them. If he was really ignorant, then God will not be prescient of all things. But they will
not even [in that case] be able to assign a reason on what account He thus left this place
void during so long a period of time. If, again, He is prescient, and contemplated mentally
that creation which was about to have a being in that place, then He Himself created it who
also formed it beforehand [ideally] in Himself.</p>
<p>2. Let them cease, therefore, to affirm that the world was made by any other; for as soon
as God formed a conception in His mind, that was also done which He had thus mentally
conceived. For it was not possible that one Being should mentally form the conception, and
another actually produce the things which had been conceived by Him in His mind. But
God, according to these heretics, mentally conceived either an eternal world or a temporal
one, both of which suppositions cannot be true. Yet if He had mentally conceived of it as
eternal, spiritual,351 and visible, it would also have been formed such. But if it was formed
such as it really is, then He made it such who had mentally conceived of it as such; or He
willed it to exist in the ideality352 of the Father, according to the conception of His mind,
such as it now is, compound, mutable, and transient. Since, then, it is just such as the Father
had [ideally] formed in counsel with Himself, it must be worthy of the Father. But to affirm
that what was mentally conceived and pre-created by the Father of all, just as it has been

great blasphemy. For, according to them, the Father of all will thus be [regarded as] generating

the fruits of ignorance, since the things which He had conceived in His mind have actually
been produced.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The absurdity of the supposed vacuum and defect of the heretics
is demonstrated.</head>
<p>1. The cause, then, of such a dispensation on the part of God, is to be inquired after; but
the formation of the world is not to be ascribed to any other. And all things are to be spoken
of as having been so prepared by God beforehand, that they should be made as they have
been made; but shadow and vacuity are not to be conjured into existence. But whence, let
me ask, came this vacuity [of which they speak]? If it was indeed produced by Him who,
according to them, is the Father and Author of all things, then it is both equal in honour
and related to the rest of the Æons, perchance even more ancient than they are. Moreover,
if it proceeded from the same source [as they did], it must be similar in nature to Him who
produced it, as well as to those along with whom it was produced. There will therefore be
an absolute necessity, both that the Bythus of whom they speak, along with Sige, be similar
in nature to a vacuum, that is, that He really is a vacuum; and that the rest of the Æons,
since they are the brothers of vacuity, should also be devoid353 of substance. If, on the other
hand, it has not been thus produced, it must have sprang from and been generated by itself,
and in that case it will be equal in point of age to that Bythus who is, according to them, the
Father of all; and thus vacuity will be of the same nature and of the same honour with Him
who is, according to them, the universal Father. For it must of necessity have been either
produced by some one, or generated by itself, and sprung from itself. But if, in truth, vacuity
was produced, then its producer Valentinus is also a vacuum, as are likewise his followers.
If, again, it was not produced, but was generated by itself, then that which is really a vacuum
is similar to, and the brother of, and of the same honour with, that Father who has been
proclaimed by Valentinus; while it is more ancient, and dating its existence from a period
greatly anterior, and more exalted in honour than the remaining Æons of Ptolemy himself,
and Heracleon, and all the rest354 who hold the same opinions.</p>
<p>2. But if, driven to despair in regard to these points, they confess that the Father of all
contains all things, and that there is nothing whatever outside of the Pleroma (for it is an
absolute necessity that, [if there be anything outside of it,] it should be bounded and circumscribed
by something greater than itself), and that they speak of what is without and what
within in reference to knowledge and ignorance, and not with respect to local distance; but
that, in the Pleroma, or in those things which are contained by the Father, the whole creation
which we know to have been formed, having been made by the Demiurge, or by the angels,
is contained by the unspeakable greatness, as the centre is in a circle, or as a spot is in a
garment, —then, in the first place, what sort of a being must that Bythus be, who allows a

<pb n="947"/>
stain to have place in His own bosom, and permits another one to create or produce within
His territory, contrary to His own will? Such a mode of acting would truly entail [the charge
of] degeneracy upon the entire Pleroma, since it might from the first have cut off that defect,
and those emanations which derived their origin from it,355 and not have agreed to permit
the formation of creation either in ignorance, or passion, or in defect. For he who can afterwards
rectify a defect, and does, as it were, wash away a stain,356 could at a much earlier
date have taken care that no such stain should, even at first, be found among his possessions.
Or if at the first he allowed that the things which were made [should be as they are], since
they could not, in fact, be formed otherwise, then it follows that they must always continue
in the same condition. For how is it possible, that those things which cannot at the first obtain
rectification, should subsequently receive it? Or how can men say that they are called to
perfection, when those very beings who are the causes from which men derive their origin—
either the Demiurge himself, or the angels—are declared to exist in defect? And if, as
is maintained, [the Supreme Being,] inasmuch as He is benignant, did at last take pity upon
men, and bestow on them perfection, He ought at first to have pitied those who were the
creators of man, and to have conferred on them perfection. In this way, men too would
verily have shared in His compassion, being formed perfect by those that were perfect. For
if He pitied the work of these beings, He ought long before to have pitied themselves, and
not to have allowed them to fall into such awful blindness.</p>
<p>3. Their talk also about shadow and vacuity, in which they maintain that the creation
with which we are concerned was formed, will be brought to nothing, if the things referred
to were created within the territory which is contained by the Father. For if they hold that
the light of their Father is such that it fills all things which are inside of Him, and illuminates
them all, how can any vacuum or shadow possibly exist within that territory which is contained
by the Pleroma, and by the light of the Father? For, in that case, it behoves them to
point out some place within the Propator, or within the Pleroma, which is not illuminated,
nor kept possession of by any one, and in which either the angels or the Demiurge formed
whatever they pleased. Nor will it be a small amount of space in which such and so great a
creation can be conceived of as having been formed. There will therefore be an absolute
necessity that, within the Pleroma, or within the Father of whom they speak, they should
conceive357 of some place, void, formless, and full of darkness, in which those things were

formed which have been formed. By such a supposition, however, the light of their Father
would incur a reproach, as if He could not illuminate and fill those things which are within
Himself. Thus, then, when they maintain that these things were the fruit of defect and the
work of error, they do moreover introduce defect and error within the Pleroma, and into
the bosom of the Father.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—This world was not formed by any other beings within the territory
which is contained by the Father.</head>
<p>1. The remarks, therefore, which I made a little while ago358 are suitable in answer to
those who assert that this world was formed outside of the Pleroma, or under a “good God;”
and such persons, with the Father they speak of, will be quite cut off from that which is
outside the Pleroma, in which, at the same time, it is necessary that they should finally
rest.359 In answer to those, again, who maintain that this world was formed by certain other
beings within that territory which is contained by the Father, all those points which have
now360 been noticed will present themselves [as exhibiting their] absurdities and incoherencies;
and they will be compelled either to acknowledge all those things which are within
the Father, lucid, full, and energetic, or to accuse the light of the Father as if He could not
illuminate all things; or, as a portion of their Pleroma [is so described], the whole of it must
be confessed to be void, chaotic, and full of darkness. And they accuse all other created
things as if these were merely temporal, or [at the best], if eternal,361 yet material. But362
these (the Æons) ought to be regarded as beyond the reach of such accusations, since they
are within the Pleroma, or the charges in question will equally fall against the entire Pleroma;
and thus the Christ of whom they speak is discovered to be the author of ignorance. For,
according to their statements, when He had given a form so far as substance was concerned
to the Mother they conceive of, He cast her outside of the Pleroma; that is, He cut her off
from knowledge. He, therefore, who separated her from knowledge, did in reality produce
ignorance in her. How then could the very same person bestow the gift of knowledge on
the rest of the Æons, those who were anterior to Him [in production], and yet be the author
of ignorance to His Mother? For He placed her beyond the pale of knowledge, when He cast
her outside of the Pleroma.</p>
<note type="footnote">358 See above, chap. i.</note>
<note type="footnote">359 The Latin text here is, “et concludentur tales cum patre suo ab eo qui est extra Pleroma, in quo etiam et
desinere eos necesse est.” None of the editors notice the difficulty or obscurity of the clause, but it appears to us
absolutely untranslateable. We have rendered it as if the reading were “ab eo quod,” though, if the strict grammatical
construction be followed, the translation must be, “from Him who.” But then to what does “in quo,”
which follows, refer? It may be ascribed either to the immediate antecedent Pleroma, or to Him who is described
as being beyond it.</note>
<note type="footnote">360 Chap. ii., iii., iv.</note>
<note type="footnote">361 This is an extremely difficult passage. We follow the reading æternochoica adopted by Massuet, but

of the material creation, as though Æon substance were equally ephemeral and choic.”</note>
<note type="footnote">362 The common reading is “aut;” we adopt Harvey’s conjectural emendation of “at.”</note>

<pb n="950"/>
<p>2. Moreover, if they explain being within and without the Pleroma as implying knowledge
and ignorance respectively, as certain of them do (since he who has knowledge is within
that which knows), then they must of necessity grant that the Saviour Himself (whom they
designate All Things) was in a state of ignorance. For they maintain that, on His coming
forth outside of the Pleroma, He imparted form to their Mother [Achamoth]. If, then, they
assert that whatever is outside [the Pleroma] is ignorant of all things, and if the Saviour went
forth to impart form to their Mother, then He was situated beyond the pale of the knowledge
of all things; that is, He was in ignorance. How then could He communicate knowledge to
her, when He Himself was beyond the pale of knowledge? For we, too, they declare to be
outside the Pleroma, inasmuch as we are outside of the knowledge which they possess. And
once more: If the Saviour really went forth beyond the Pleroma to seek after the sheep which
was lost, but the Pleroma is [co-extensive with] knowledge, then He placed Himself beyond
the pale of knowledge, that is, in ignorance. For it is necessary either that they grant that
what is outside the Pleroma is so in a local sense, in which case all the remarks formerly
made will rise up against them; or if they speak of that which is within in regard to knowledge,
and of that which is without in respect to ignorance, then their Saviour, and Christ long
before Him, must have been formed in ignorance, inasmuch as they went forth beyond the
Pleroma, that is, beyond the pale of knowledge, in order to impart form to their Mother.</p>
<p>3. These arguments may, in like manner, be adapted to meet the case of all those who,
in any way, maintain that the world was formed either by angels or by any other one than
the true God. For the charges which they bring against the Demiurge, and those things
which were made material and temporal, will in truth fall back on the Father; if indeed the363
very things which were formed in the bosom of the Pleroma began by and by in fact to be
dissolved, in accordance with the permission and good-will of the Father. The [immediate]
Creator, then, is not the [real] Author of this work, thinking, as He did, that He formed it
very good, but He who allows and approves of the productions of defect, and the works of
error having a place among his own possessions, and that temporal things should be mixed
up with eternal, corruptible with incorruptible, and those which partake of error with those
which belong to truth. If, however, these things were formed without the permission or
approbation of the Father of all, then that Being must be more powerful, stronger, and more
kingly, who made these things within a territory which properly belongs to Him (the Father),
and did so without His permission. If again, as some say, their Father permitted these things
without approving of them, then He gave the permission on account of some necessity, being
either able to prevent [such procedure], or not able. But if indeed He could not [hinder it],
then He is weak and powerless; while, if He could, He is a seducer, a hypocrite, and a slave
of necessity, inasmuch as He does not consent [to such a course], and yet allows it as if He
<note type="footnote">363 The above clause is very obscure; Massuet reads it interrogatively.</note>

<pb n="951"/>
did consent. And allowing error to arise at the first, and to go on increasing, He endeavours
in later times to destroy it, when already many have miserably perished on account of the
[original] defect.</p>
<p>4. It is not seemly, however, to say of Him who is God over all, since He is free and independent,
that He was a slave to necessity, or that anything takes place with His permission,
yet against His desire; otherwise they will make necessity greater and more kingly than God,
since that which has the most power is superior364 to all [others]. And He ought at the very
beginning to have cut off the causes of [the fancied] necessity, and not to have allowed
Himself to be shut up to yielding to that necessity, by permitting anything besides that which
became Him. For it would have been much better, more consistent, and more God-like, to
cut off at the beginning the principle of this kind of necessity, than afterwards, as if moved
by repentance, to endeavour to extirpate the results of necessity when they had reached such
a development. And if the Father of all be a slave to necessity, and must yield to fate, while
He unwillingly tolerates the things which are done, but is at the same time powerless to do
anything in opposition to necessity and fate (like the Homeric Jupiter, who says of necessity,
“I have willingly given thee, yet with unwilling mind”), then, according to this reasoning,
the Bythus of whom they speak will be found to be the slave of necessity and fate.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The angels and the Creator of the world could not have been
ignorant of the Supreme God.</head>
<p>1. How, again, could either the angels, or the Creator of the world, have been ignorant
of the Supreme God, seeing they were His property, and His creatures, and were contained
by Him? He might indeed have been invisible to them on account of His superiority, but
He could by no means have been unknown to them on account of His providence. For
though it is true, as they declare, that they were very far separated from Him through their
inferiority [of nature], yet, as His dominion extended over all of them, it behoved them to
know their Ruler, and to be aware of this in particular, that He who created them is Lord
of all. For since His invisible essence is mighty, it confers on all a profound mental intuition
and perception of His most powerful, yea, omnipotent greatness. Wherefore, although “no
one knows the Father, except the Son, nor the Son except the Father, and those to whom
the Son will reveal Him,”365 yet all [beings] do know this one fact at least, because reason,
implanted in their minds, moves them, and reveals to them [the truth] that there is one
God, the Lord of all.</p>
<p>2. And on this account all things have been [by general consent] placed under the sway
of Him who is styled the Most High, and the Almighty. By calling upon Him, even before
the coming of our Lord, men were saved both from most wicked spirits, and from all kinds
of demons, and from every sort of apostate power. This was the case, not as if earthly spirits
or demons had seen Him, but because they knew of the existence of Him who is God over
all, at whose invocation they trembled, as there does tremble every creature, and principality,
and power, and every being endowed with energy under His government. By way of parallel,
shall not those who live under the empire of the Romans, although they have never seen
the emperor, but are far separated from him both by land and sea, know very well, as they
experience his rule, who it is that possesses the principal power in the state? How then could
it be, that those angels who were superior to us [in nature], or even He whom they call the
Creator of the world, did not know the Almighty, when even dumb animals tremble and
yield at the invocation of His name? And as, although they have not seen Him, yet all things
are subject to the name of our Lord,366 so must they also be to His who made and established
all things by His word, since it was no other than He who formed the world. And for this
reason do the Jews even now put demons to flight by means of this very adjuration, inasmuch
as all beings fear the invocation of Him who created them.</p>
<p>3. If, then, they shrink from affirming that the angels are more irrational than the dumb

over all, to know His power and sovereignty. For it will appear truly ridiculous, if they

<pb n="953"/>
maintain that they themselves indeed, who dwell upon the earth, know Him who is God
over all whom they have never seen, but will not allow Him who, according to their opinion,
formed them and the whole world, although He dwells in the heights and above the heavens,
to know those things with which they themselves, though they dwell below, are acquainted.
[This is the case], unless perchance they maintain that Bythus lives in Tartarus below the
earth, and that on this account they have attained to a knowledge of Him before those angels
who have their abode on high. Thus do they rush into such an abyss of madness as to pronounce
the Creator of the world void of understanding. They are truly deserving of pity,
since with such utter folly they affirm that He (the Creator of the world) neither knew His
Mother, nor her seed, nor the Pleroma of the Æons, nor the Propator, nor what the things
were which He made; but that these are images of those things which are within the Pleroma,
the Saviour having secretly laboured that they should be so formed [by the unconscious
Demiurge], in honour of those things which are above.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Created things are not the images of those Æons who are within
the Pleroma.</head>
<p>1. While the Demiurge was thus ignorant of all things, they tell us that the Saviour
conferred honour upon the Pleroma by the creation [which he summoned into existence]
through means of his Mother, inasmuch as he produced similitudes and images of those
things which are above. But I have already shown that it was impossible that anything should
exist beyond the Pleroma (in which external region they tell us that images were made of
those things which are within the Pleroma), or that this world was formed by any other one
than the Supreme God. But it is a pleasant thing to overthrow them on every side, and to
prove them vendors of falsehood; let us say, in opposition to them, that if these things were
made by the Saviour to the honour of those which are above, after their likeness, then it
behoved them always to endure, that those things which have been honoured should perpetually
continue in honour. But if they do in fact pass away, what is the use of this very
brief period of honour,—an honour which at one time had no existence, and which shall
again come to nothing? In that case I shall prove that the Saviour is rather an aspirant after
vainglory, than367 one who honours those things which are above. For what honour can
those things which are temporal confer on such as are eternal and endure for ever? or those
which pass away on such as remain? or those which are corruptible on such as are incorruptible?—
since, even among men who are themselves mortal, there is no value attached to that
honour which speedily passes away, but to that which endures as long as it possibly can.
But those things which, as soon as they are made, come to an end, may justly be said rather
to have been formed for the contempt of such as are thought to be honoured by them; and
that that which is eternal is contumeliously treated when its image is corrupted and dissolved.
But what if their Mother had not wept, and laughed, and been involved in despair? The Saviour
would not then have possessed any means of honouring the Fulness, inasmuch as her
last state of confusion368 did not have substance of its own by which it might honour the
Propator.</p>
<p>2. Alas for the honour of vainglory which at once passes away, and no longer appears!
There will be some369 Æon, in whose case such honour will not be thought at all to have
<note type="footnote">367 Harvey supposes that the translator here read ? quam instead of ? quâ (gloria); but Grabe, Massuet, and

vacuity, and, in fact, non-existence, until compassionated by the Christ above, who gave her form as respected
substance.</note>
<note type="footnote">369 We have literally translated the above very obscure sentence. According to Massuet, the sense is: “There
will some time be, or perhaps even now there is, some Æon utterly destitute of such honour, inasmuch as those
things which the Saviour, for the sake of honouring it, had formed after its image, have been destroyed; and
then those things which are above will remain without honour,” etc.</note>

<pb n="955"/>
had an existence, and then the things which are above will be unhonoured; or it will be necessary
to produce once more another Mother weeping, and in despair, in order to the
honour of the Pleroma. What a dissimilar, and at the same time blasphemous image! Do
you tell me that an image of the Only-begotten was produced by the former370 of the world,
whom371 again ye wish to be considered the Nous (mind) of the Father of all, and [yet
maintain] that this image was ignorant of itself, ignorant of creation,—ignorant, too, of the
Mother,—ignorant of everything that exists, and of those things which were made by it; and
are you not ashamed while, in opposition to yourselves, you ascribe ignorance even to the
Only-begotten Himself? For if these things [below] were made by the Saviour after the
similitude of those which are above, while He (the Demiurge) who was made after such
similitude was in so great ignorance, it necessarily follows that around Him, and in accordance
with Him, after whose likeness he that is thus ignorant was formed, ignorance of the
kind in question spiritually exists. For it is not possible, since both were produced spiritually,
and neither fashioned nor composed, that in some the likeness was preserved, while in
others the likeness of the image was spoiled, that image which was here produced that it
might be according to the image of that production which is above. But if it is not similar,
the charge will then attach to the Saviour, who produced a dissimilar image,—of being, so
to speak, an incompetent workman. For it is out of their power to affirm that the Saviour
had not the faculty of production, since they style Him All Things. If, then, the image is
dissimilar, he is a poor workman, and the blame lies, according to their hypothesis, with
the Saviour. If, on the other hand, it is similar, then the same ignorance will be found to
exist in the Nous (mind) of their Propator, that is, in the Only-begotten. The Nous of the
Father, in that case, was ignorant of Himself; ignorant, too, of the Father; ignorant, moreover,
of those very things which were formed by Him. But if He has knowledge, it necessarily
follows also that he who was formed after his likeness by the Saviour should know the things
which are like; and thus, according to their own principles, their monstrous blasphemy is
overthrown.</p>
<p>3. Apart from this, however, how can those things which belong to creation, various,
manifold, and innumerable as they are, be the images of those thirty Æons which are within
the Pleroma, whose names, as these men fix them, I have set forth in the book which precedes
this? And not only will they be unable to adapt the [vast] variety of creation at large to the
[comparative] smallness of their Pleroma, but they cannot do this even with respect to any
one part of it, whether [that possessed by] celestial or terrestrial beings, or those that live in
the waters. For they themselves testify that their Pleroma consists of thirty Æons; but any
one will undertake to show that, in a single department of those [created beings] which have
<note type="footnote">370 The Saviour is here referred to, as having formed all things through means of Achamoth and the Demiurge.</note>
<note type="footnote">371 Massuet deletes quem, and reads nun as a genitive.</note>

<pb n="956"/>
been mentioned, they reckon that there are not thirty, but many thousands of species. How
then can those things, which constitute such a multiform creation, which are opposed in
nature to each other, and disagree among themselves, and destroy the one the other, be the
images and likenesses of the thirty Æons of the Pleroma, if indeed, as they declare, these
being possessed of one nature, are of equal and similar properties, and exhibit no differences
[among themselves]? For it was incumbent, if these things are images of those
Æons,—inasmuch as they declare that some men are wicked by nature, and some, on the
other hand, naturally good,—to point out such differences also among their Æons, and to
maintain that some of them were produced naturally good, while some were naturally evil,
so that the supposition of the likeness of those things might harmonize with the Æons.
Moreover, since there are in the world some creatures that are gentle, and others that are
fierce, some that are innocuous, while others are hurtful and destroy the rest; some have
their abode on the earth, others in the water, others in the air, and others in the heaven; in
like manner, they are bound to show that the Æons possess such properties, if indeed the
one are the images of the others. And besides; “the eternal fire which the Father has prepared
for the devil and his angels,”372— they ought to show of which of those Æons that are above
it is the image; for it, too, is reckoned part of the creation.</p>
<p>4. If, however, they say that these things are the images of the Enthymesis of that Æon
who fell into passion, then, first of all, they will act impiously against their Mother, by declaring
her to be the first cause of evil and corruptible images. And then, again, how can
those things which are manifold, and dissimilar, and contrary in their nature, be the images
of one and the same Being? And if they say that the angels of the Pleroma are numerous,
and that those things which are many are the images of these—not in this way either will
the account they give be satisfactory. For, in the first place, they are then bound to point
out differences among the angels of the Pleroma, which are mutually opposed to each other,
even as the images existing below are of a contrary nature among themselves. And then,
again, since there are many, yea, innumerable angels who surround the Creator, as all the
prophets acknowledge,—[saying, for instance,] “Ten thousand times ten thousand stood
beside Him, and many thousands of thousands ministered unto Him,”373—then, according374
to them, the angels of the Pleroma will have as images the angels of the Creator, and the
<note type="footnote">372 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">373 Dan. vii. 10, agreeing neither with the Greek nor Hebrew text.</note>
<note type="footnote">374 This clause is exceedingly obscure. Harvey remarks upon it as follows: “The reasoning of Irenæus seems
to be this: According to the Gnostic theory, the Æons and angels of the Pleroma were homogeneous. They were
also the archetypes of things created. But things created are heterogeneous: therefore either these Æons are
heterogeneous, which is contrary to theory; or things created are homogeneous, which is contrary to fact.”</note>

<pb n="957"/>
entire creation remains in the image of the Pleroma, but so that the thirty Æons no longer
correspond to the manifold variety of the creation.</p>
<p>5. Still further, if these things [below] were made after the similitude of those [above],
after the likeness of which again will those then be made? For if the Creator of the world
did not form these things directly from His own375 conception, but, like an architect of no
ability, or a boy receiving his first lesson, copied them from archetypes furnished by others,
then whence did their Bythus obtain the forms of that creation which He at first produced?
It clearly follows that He must have received the model from some other one who is above
Him, and that one, in turn, from another. And none the less [for these suppositions], the
talk about images, as about gods, will extend to infinity, if we do not at once fix our mind
on one Artificer, and on one God, who of Himself formed those things which have been
created. Or is it really the case that, in regard to mere men, one will allow that they have of
themselves invented what is useful for the purposes of life, but will not grant to that God
who formed the world, that of Himself He created the forms of those things which have
been made, and imparted to it its orderly arrangement?</p>
<p>6. But, again, how can these things [below] be images of those [above], since they are
really contrary to them, and can in no respect have sympathy with them? For those things
which are contrary to each other may indeed be destructive of those to which they are contrary,
but can by no means be their images—as, for instance, water and fire; or, again, light
and darkness, and other such things, can never be the images of one another. In like manner,
neither can those things which are corruptible and earthly, and of a compound nature, and
transitory, be the images of those which, according to these men, are spiritual; unless these
very things themselves be allowed to be compound, limited in space, and of a definite shape,
and thus no longer spiritual, and diffused, and spreading into vast extent, and incomprehensible.
For they must of necessity be possessed of a definite figure, and confined within
certain limits, that they may be true images; and then it is decided that they are not spiritual.
If, however, these men maintain that they are spiritual, and diffused, and incomprehensible,
how can those things which are possessed of figure, and confined within certain limits, be
the images of such as are destitute of figure and incomprehensible?</p>
<p>7. If, again, they affirm that neither according to configuration nor formation, but according
to number and the order of production, those things [above] are the images [of
these below], then, in the first place, these things [below] ought not to be spoken of as images
and likenesses of those Æons that are above. For how can the things which have neither the
fashion nor shape of those [above] be their images? And, in the next place, they would adapt
both the numbers and productions of the Æons above, so as to render them identical with
and similar to those that belong to the creation [below]. But now, since they refer to only
<note type="footnote">375 Literally, “from Himself.”</note>

<pb n="958"/>
thirty Æons, and declare that the vast multitude of things which are embraced within the
creation [below] are images of those that are but thirty, we may justly condemn them as
utterly destitute of sense.</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">

<head>Chapter VIII.—Created things are not a shadow of the Pleroma.</head>
<p>1. If, again, they declare that these things [below] are a shadow of those [above], as some
of them are bold enough to maintain, so that in this respect they are images, then it will be
necessary for them to allow that those things which are above are possessed of bodies. For
those bodies which are above do cast a shadow, but spiritual substances do not, since they
can in no degree darken others. If, however, we also grant them this point (though it is, in
fact, an impossibility), that there is a shadow belonging to those essences which are spiritual
and lucent, into which they declare their Mother descended; yet, since those things [which
are above] are eternal, and that shadow which is cast by them endures for ever, [it follows
that] these things [below] are also not transitory, but endure along with those which cast
their shadow over them. If, on the other hand, these things [below] are transitory, it is a
necessary consequence that those [above] also, of which these are the shadow, pass away;
while; if they endure, their shadow likewise endures.</p>
<p>2. If, however, they maintain that the shadow spoken of does not exist as being produced
by the shade of [those above], but simply in this respect, that [the things below] are far
separated from those [above], they will then charge the light of their Father with weakness
and insufficiency, as if it cannot extend so far as these things, but fails to fill that which is
empty, and to dispel the shadow, and that when no one is offering any hindrance. For, according
to them, the light of their Father will be changed into darkness and buried in obscurity,
and will come to an end in those places which are characterized by emptiness, since
it cannot penetrate and fill all things. Let them then no longer declare that their Bythus is
the fulness of all things, if indeed he has neither filled nor illuminated that which is vacuum
and shadow; or, on the other hand, let them cease talking of vacuum and shadow, if the light
of their Father does in truth fill all things.</p>
<p>3. Beyond the primary Father, then—that is, the God who is over all—there can neither
be any Pleroma into which they declare the Enthymesis of that Æon who suffered passion,
descended (so that the Pleroma itself, or the primary God, should not be limited and circumscribed
by that which is beyond, and should, in fact, be contained by it); nor can vacuum
or shadow have any existence, since the Father exists beforehand, so that His light cannot
fail, and find end in a vacuum. It is, moreover, irrational and impious to conceive of a place
in which He who is, according to them, Propator, and Proarche, and Father of all, and of
this Pleroma, ceases and has an end. Nor, again, is it allowable, for the reasons376 already
stated, to allege that some other being formed so vast a creation in the bosom of the Father,
either with or without His consent. For it is equally impious and infatuated to affirm that
<note type="footnote">376 See above, chap. ii. and v.</note>

<pb n="960"/>
so great a creation was377 formed by angels, or by some particular production ignorant of
the true God in that territory which is His own. Nor is it possible that those things which
are earthly and material could have been formed within their Pleroma, since that is wholly
spiritual. And further, it is not even possible that those things which belong to a multiform
creation, and have been formed with mutually opposite qualities [could have been created]
after the image of the things above, since these (i.e., the Æons) are said to be few, and of a
like formation, and homogeneous. Their talk, too, about the shadow of kenoma— that is,
of a vacuum—has in all points turned out false. Their figment, then, [in what way soever
viewed,] has been proved groundless,378 and their doctrines untenable. Empty, too, are
those who listen to them, and are verily descending into the abyss of perdition.</p>
<note type="footnote">377 The text has fabricâsse, for which, says Massuet, should be read fabricatam esse; or fabricâsse itself must

<head>Chapter IX.—There is but one Creator of the world, God the Father: this the
constant belief of the Church.</head>
<p>1. That God is the Creator of the world is accepted even by those very persons who in
many ways speak against Him, and yet acknowledge Him, styling Him the Creator, and an
angel, not to mention that all the Scriptures call out [to the same effect], and the Lord teaches
us of this Father379 who is in heaven, and no other, as I shall show in the sequel of this work.
For the present, however, that proof which is derived from those who allege doctrines opposite
to ours, is of itself sufficient,—all men, in fact, consenting to this truth: the ancients
on their part preserving with special care, from the tradition of the first-formed man, this
persuasion, while they celebrate the praises of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth;
others, again, after them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets of God, while the very
heathen learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him who formed it, and
the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the world manifests Him who ordered
it. The Universal Church, moreover, through the whole world, has received this tradition
from the apostles.</p>
<p>2. This God, then, being acknowledged, as I have said, and receiving testimony from all
to the fact of His existence, that Father whom they conjure into existence is beyond doubt
untenable, and has no witnesses [to his existence]. Simon Magus was the first who said that
he himself was God over all, and that the world was formed by his angels. Then those who
succeeded him, as I have shown in the first book,380 by their several opinions, still further
depraved [his teaching] through their impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator.
These [heretics now referred to],381 being the disciples of those mentioned, render such as
assent to them worse than the heathen. For the former “serve the creature rather than the
Creator,”382 and “those which are not gods,”383 notwithstanding that they ascribe the first
place in Deity to that God who was the Maker of this universe. But the latter maintain that
He, [i.e., the Creator of this world,] is the fruit of a defect, and describe Him as being of an
animal nature, and as not knowing that Power which is above Him, while He also exclaims,
“I am God, and besides Me there is no other God.”384 Affirming that He lies, they are
themselves liars, attributing all sorts of wickedness to Him; and conceiving of one who is
not above this Being as really having an existence, they are thus convicted by their own
views of blasphemy against that God who really exists, while they conjure into existence a

<head>Chapter X.—Perverse interpretations of Scripture by the heretics: God created
all things out of nothing, and not from pre-existent matter.</head>
<p>1. It is therefore in the highest degree irrational, that we should take no account of Him
who is truly God, and who receives testimony from all, while we inquire whether there is
above Him that [other being] who really has no existence, and has never been proclaimed
by any one. For that nothing has been clearly spoken regarding Him, they themselves furnish
testimony; for since they, with wretched success, transfer to that being who has been conceived
of by them, those parables [of Scripture] which, whatever the form in which they
have been spoken, are sought after [for this purpose], it is manifest that they now generate
another [god], who was never previously sought after. For by the fact that they thus endeavour
to explain ambiguous passages of Scripture (ambiguous, however, not as if referring to
another god, but as regards the dispensations of [the true] God), they have constructed another
god, weaving, as I said before, ropes of sand, and affixing a more important to a less
important question. For no question can be solved by means of another which itself awaits
solution; nor, in the opinion of those possessed of sense, can an ambiguity be explained by
means of another ambiguity, or enigmas by means of another greater enigma, but things of
such character receive their solution from those which are manifest, and consistent and
clear.</p>
<p>2. But these [heretics], while striving to explain passages of Scripture and parables, bring
forward another more important, and indeed impious question, to this effect, “Whether
there be really another god above that God who was the Creator of the world?” They are
not in the way of solving the questions [which they propose]; for how could they find means
of doing so? But they append an important question to one of less consequence, and thus
insert [in their speculations] a difficulty incapable of solution. For in order that they may385
know “knowledge” itself (yet not learning this fact, that the Lord, when thirty years old,
came to the baptism of truth), they do impiously despise that God who was the Creator,
and who sent Him for the salvation of men. And that they may be deemed capable of informing
us whence is the substance of matter, while they believe not that God, according to His
pleasure, in the exercise of His own will and power, formed all things (so that those things
which now are should have an existence) out of what did not previously exist, they have
collected [a multitude of] vain discourses. They thus truly reveal their infidelity; they do not
believe in that which really exists, and they have fallen away into [the belief of] that which
has, in fact, no existence.</p>
<p>3. For, when they tell us that all moist substance proceeded from the tears of Achamoth,
all lucid substance from her smile, all solid substance from her sadness, all mobile substance
<note type="footnote">385 This clause is unintelligible in the Latin text: by a conjectural restoration of the Greek we have given the
above translation.</note>

<pb n="964"/>
from her terror, and that thus they have sublime knowledge on account of which they are
superior to others,—how can these things fail to be regarded as worthy of contempt, and
truly ridiculous? They do not believe that God (being powerful, and rich in all resources)
created matter itself, inasmuch as they know not how much a spiritual and divine essence
can accomplish. But they do believe that their Mother, whom they style a female from a female,
produced from her passions aforesaid the so vast material substance of creation. They
inquire, too, whence the substance of creation was supplied to the Creator; but they do not
inquire whence [were supplied] to their Mother (whom they call the Enthymesis and impulse
of the Æon that went astray) so great an amount of tears, or perspiration, or sadness, or that
which produced the remainder of matter.</p>
<p>4. For, to attribute the substance of created things to the power and will of Him who is
God of all, is worthy both of credit and acceptance. It is also agreeable [to reason], and there
may be well said regarding such a belief, that “the things which are impossible with men
are possible with God.”386 While men, indeed, cannot make anything out of nothing, but
only out of matter already existing, yet God is in this point pre-eminently superior to men,
that He Himself called into being the substance of His creation, when previously it had no
existence. But the assertion that matter was produced from the Enthymesis of an Æon going
astray, and that the Æon [referred to] was far separated from her Enthymesis, and that,
again, her passion and feeling, apart from herself, became matter—is incredible, infatuated,
impossible, and untenable.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The heretics, from their disbelief of the truth, have fallen into an
abyss of error: reasons for investigating their systems.</head>
<p>1. They do not believe that He, who is God above all, formed by His Word, in His own
territory, as He Himself pleased, the various and diversified [works of creation which exist],
inasmuch as He is the former of all things, like a wise architect, and a most powerful monarch.
But they believe that angels, or some power separate from God, and who was ignorant of
Him, formed this universe. By this course, therefore, not yielding credit to the truth, but
wallowing in falsehood, they have lost the bread of true life, and have fallen into vacuity387
and an abyss of shadow. They are like the dog of Æsop, which dropped the bread, and made
an attempt at seizing its shadow, thus losing the [real] food. It is easy to prove from the very
words of the Lord, that He acknowledges one Father and Creator of the world, and Fashioner
of man, who was proclaimed by the law and the prophets, while He knows no other, and
that this One is really God over all; and that He teaches that that adoption of sons pertaining
to the Father, which is eternal life, takes place through Himself, conferring it [as He does]
on all the righteous.</p>
<p>2. But since these men delight in attacking us, and in their true character of cavillers
assail us with points which really tell not at all against us, bringing forward in opposition
to us a multitude of parables and [captious] questions, I have thought it well, on the other
side, first of all to put to them the following inquiries concerning their own doctrines, to
exhibit their improbability, and to put an end to their audacity. After this has been done, [I
intend] to bring forward the discourses of the Lord, so that they may not only be rendered
destitute of the means of attacking us, but that, since they will be unable reasonably to reply
to those questions which are put, they may see that their plan of argument is destroyed; so
that, either returning to the truth, and humbling themselves, and ceasing from their multifarious
phantasies, they may propitiate God for those blasphemies they have uttered against
Him, and obtain salvation; or that, if they still persevere in that system of vainglory which
has taken possession of their minds, they may at least find it necessary to change their kind
of argument against us.</p>

<p>1. We may388 remark, in the first place, regarding their Triacontad, that the whole of it
marvellously falls to ruin on both sides, that is, both as respects defect and excess. They say
that to indicate it the Lord came to be baptized at the age of thirty years. But this assertion
really amounts to a manifest subversion of their entire argument. As to defect, this happens
as follows: first of all, because they reckon the Propator among the other Æons. For the
Father of all ought not to be counted with other productions; He who was not produced
with that which was produced; He who was unbegotten with that which was born; He whom
no one comprehends with that which is comprehended by Him, and who is on this account
[Himself] incomprehensible; and He who is without figure with that which has a definite
shape. For inasmuch as He is superior to the rest, He ought not to be numbered with them,
and that so that He who is impassible and not in error should be reckoned with an Æon
subject to passion, and actually in error. For I have shown in the book which immediately
precedes this, that, beginning with Bythus, they reckon up the Triacontad to Sophia, whom
they describe as the erring Æon; and I have also there set forth the names of their [Æons];
but if He be not reckoned, there are no longer, on their own showing, thirty productions of
Æons, but these then become only twenty-nine.</p>
<p>2. Next, with respect to the first production Ennoea, whom they also term Sige, from
whom again they describe Nous and Aletheia as having been sent forth, they err in both
particulars. For it is impossible that the thought (Ennoea) of any one, or his silence (Sige),
should be understood apart from himself; and that, being sent forth beyond him, it should
possess a special figure of its own. But if they assert that the (Ennoea) was not sent forth
beyond Him, but continued one with the Propator, why then do they reckon her with the
other Æons —with those who were not one [with the Father], and are on this account ignorant
of His greatness? If, however, she was so united (let us take this also into consideration),
there is then an absolute necessity, that from this united and inseparable conjunction, which
constitutes but one being, there389 should proceed an unseparated and united production,
so that it should not be dissimilar to Him who sent it forth. But if this be so, then just as
Bythus and Sige, so also Nous and Aletheia will form one and the same being, ever cleaving
mutually together. And inasmuch as the one cannot be conceived of without the other, just
as water cannot [be conceived of] without [the thought of] moisture, or fire without [the
thought of] heat, or a stone without [the thought] of hardness (for these things are mutually
bound together, and the one cannot be separated from the other, but always co-exists with

<pb n="967"/>
it), so it behoves Bythus to be united in the same way with Ennoea, and Nous with Aletheia.
Logos and Zoe again, as being sent forth by those that are thus united, ought themselves to
be united, and to constitute only one being. But, according to such a process of reasoning,
Homo and Ecclesia too, and indeed all the remaining conjunctions of the Æons produced,
ought to be united, and always to co-exist, the one with the other. For there is a necessity
in their opinion, that a female Æon should exist side by side with a male one, inasmuch as
she is, so to speak, [the forthputting of] his affection.</p>
<p>3. These things being so, and such opinions being proclaimed by them, they again venture,
without a blush, to teach that the younger Æon of the Duodecad, whom they also style
Sophia, did, apart from union with her consort, whom they call Theletus, endure passion,
and separately, without any assistance from him, gave birth to a production which they
name “a female from a female.” They thus rush into such utter frenzy, as to form two most
clearly opposite opinions respecting the same point. For if Bythus is ever one with Sige,
Nous with Aletheia, Logos with Zoe, and so on, as respects the rest, how could Sophia,
without union with her consort, either suffer or generate anything? And if, again, she did
really suffer passion apart from him, it necessarily follows that the other conjunctions also
admit of disjunction and separation among themselves,—a thing which I have already shown
to be impossible. It is also impossible, therefore, that Sophia suffered passion apart from
Theletus; and thus, again, their whole system of argument is overthrown. For they have
yet390 again derived the whole of remaining [material substance], like the composition of
a tragedy, from that passion which they affirm she experienced apart from union with her
consort.</p>
<p>4. If, however, they impudently maintain, in order to preserve from ruin their vain
imaginations, that the rest of the conjunctions also were disjoined and separated from one
another on account of this latest conjunction, then [I reply that], in the first place, they rest
upon a thing which is impossible. For how can they separate the Propator from his Ennoea,
or Nous from Aletheia, or Logos from Zoe, and so on with the rest? And how can they
themselves maintain that they tend again to unity, and are, in fact, all at one, if indeed these
very conjunctions, which are within the Pleroma, do not preserve unity, but are separate
from one another; and that to such a degree, that they both endure passion and perform
the work of generation without union one with another, just as hens do apart from intercourse
with cocks.</p>
<p>5. Then, again, their first and first-begotten Ogdoad will be overthrown as follows: They
must admit that Bythus and Sige, Nous and Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia,
do individually dwell in the same Pleroma. But it is impossible that Sige (silence) can exist
in the presence of Logos (speech), or again, that Logos can manifest himself in the presence
<note type="footnote">390 It is difficult to see the meaning of “iterum” here. Harvey begins a new paragraph with this sentence.</note>

<pb n="968"/>
of Sige. For these are mutually destructive of each other, even as light and darkness can by
no possibility exist in the same place: for if light prevails, there cannot be darkness; and if
darkness, there cannot be light, since, where light appears, darkness is put to flight. In like
manner, where Sige is, there cannot be Logos; and where Logos is, there certainly cannot
be Sige. But if they say that Logos simply exists within391 (unexpressed), Sige also will exist
within, and will not the less be destroyed by the Logos within. But that he really is not merely
conceived of in the mind, the very order of the production of their (Æons) shows.</p>
<p>6. Let them not then declare that the first and principal Ogdoad consists of Logos and
Sige, but let them [as a matter of necessity] exclude either Sige or Logos; and then their first
and principal Ogdoad is at an end. For if they describe the conjunctions [of the Æons] as
united, then their whole argument fails to pieces. Since, if they were united, how could
Sophia have generated a defect without union with her consort? If, on the other hand, they
maintain that, as in production, each of the Æons possesses his own peculiar substance,
then how can Sige and Logos manifest themselves in the same place? So far, then, with respect
to defect.</p>
<p>7. But again, their Triacontad is overthrown as to excess by the following considerations.
They represent Horos (whom they call by a variety of names which I have mentioned in the
preceding book) as having been produced by Monogenes just like the other Æons. Some of
them maintain that this Horos was produced by Monogenes, while others affirm that he
was sent forth by the Propator himself in His own image. They affirm further, that a production
was formed by Monogenes— Christ and the Holy Spirit; and they do not reckon these
in the number of the Pleroma, nor the Saviour either, whom they also declare to be Totum392
(all things). Now, it is evident even to a blind man, that not merely thirty productions, as
they maintain, were sent forth, but four more along with these thirty. For they reckon the
Propator himself in the Pleroma, and those too, who in succession were produced by one
another. Why is it, then, that those [other beings] are not reckoned as existing with these
in the same Pleroma, since they were produced in the same manner? For what just reason
can they assign for not reckoning along with the other Æons, either Christ, whom they describe
as having, according to the Father’s will, been produced by Monogenes, or the Holy
Spirit, or Horos, whom they also call Soter393 (Saviour), and not even the Saviour Himself,
who came to impart assistance and form to their Mother? Whether is this as if these latter

<note type="footnote">393 Since Soter does not occur among the various appellations of Horos mentioned by Irenæus (i. 11, 4),

<pb n="969"/>
were weaker than the former, and therefore unworthy of the name of Æons, or of being
numbered among them, or as if they were superior and more excellent? But how could they
be weaker, since they were produced for the establishment and rectification of the others?
And then, again, they cannot possibly be superior to the first and principal Tetrad, by which 
they were also produced; for it, too, is reckoned in the number above mentioned. These
latter beings, then, ought also to have been numbered in the Pleroma of the Æons, or that
should be deprived of the honour of those Æons which bear this appellation (the Tetrad).</p>
<p>8. Since, therefore, their Triacontad is thus brought to nought, as I have shown, both
with respect to defect and excess (for in dealing with such a number, either excess or defect
[to any extent] will render the number untenable, and how much more so great variations?),
it follows that what they maintain respecting their Ogdoad and Duodecad is a mere fable
which cannot stand. Their whole system, moreover, falls to the ground, when their very
foundation is destroyed and dissolved into Bythus,394 that is, into what has no existence.
Let them, then, henceforth seek to set forth some other reasons why the Lord came to be
baptized at the age of thirty years, and [explain in some other way] the Duodecad of the
apostles; and [the fact stated regarding] her who suffered from an issue of blood; and all the
other points respecting which they so madly labour in vain.</p>
<note type="footnote">394 Irenæus here, after his custom, plays upon the word Bythus (profundity), which, in the phraseology of

<head>Chapter XIII.—The first order of production maintained by the heretics is
altogether indefensible.</head>
<p>1. I now proceed to show, as follows, that the first order of production, as conceived of
by them, must be rejected. For they maintain that Nous and Aletheia were produced from
Bythus and his Ennoea, which is proved to be a contradiction. For Nous is that which is itself
chief, and highest, and, as it were, the principle and source of all understanding. Ennoea,
again, which arises from him, is any sort of emotion concerning any subject. It cannot be,
therefore, that Nous was produced by Bythus and Ennoea; it would be more like the truth
for them to maintain that Ennoea was produced as the daughter of the Propator and this
Nous. For Ennoea is not the daughter of Nous, as they assert, but Nous becomes the father
of Ennoea. For how can Nous have been produced by the Propator, when he holds the chief
and primary place of that hidden and invisible affection which is within Him? By this affection
sense is produced, and Ennoea, and Enthymesis, and other things which are simply synonyms
for Nous himself. As I have said already, they are merely certain definite exercises in thought
of that very power concerning some particular subject. We understand the [several] terms
according to their395 length and breadth of meaning, not according to any [fundamental]
change [of signification]; and the [various exercises of thought] are limited by [the same
sphere of] knowledge, and are expressed together by [the same] term, the [very same] sense
remaining within, and creating, and administering, and freely governing even by its own
power, and as it pleases, the things which have been previously mentioned.</p>
<p>2. For the first exercise of that [power] respecting anything, is styled Ennoea; but when
it continues, and gathers strength, and takes possession of the whole soul, it is called Enthymesis.
This Enthymesis, again, when it exercises itself a long time on the same point,
and has, as it were, been proved, is named Sensation. And this Sensation, when it is much
developed, becomes Counsel. The increase, again, and greatly developed exercise of this
Counsel becomes the Examination of thought (Judgment); and this remaining in the mind
is most properly termed Logos (reason), from which the spoken Logos (word) proceeds.396
But all the [exercises of thought] which have been mentioned are [fundamentally] one and
the same, receiving their origin from Nous, and obtaining [different] appellation according
to their increase. Just as the human body, which is at one time young, then in the prime of
life, and then old, has received [different] appellations according to its increase and continu-
<note type="footnote">395 This sentence appears to us, after long study, totally untranslateable. The general meaning seems to be,
that whatever name is given to mental acts, whether they are called Ennoea, Enthymesis, or by whatever other
appellation, they are all but exercises of the same fundamental power, styled Nous. Compare the following section.</note>
<note type="footnote">396 “The following,” says Harvey, “may be considered to be consecutive steps in the evolution of ????? as a
psychological entity. Ennoea, conception; Enthymesis, intention; Sensation, thought; Consilium, reasoning; Cogitationis

<pb n="971"/>
ance, but not according to any change of substance, or on account of any [real] loss of body,
so is it with those [mental exercises]. For, when one [mentally] contemplates anything, he
also thinks of it; and when he thinks of it, he has also knowledge regarding it; and when he
knows it, he also considers it; and when he considers it, he also mentally handles it; and
when he mentally handles it, he also speaks of it. But, as I have already said, it is Nous who
governs all these [mental processes], while He is himself invisible, and utters speech of
himself by means of those processes which have been mentioned, as it were by rays [proceeding
from Him], but He himself is not sent forth by any other.</p>
<p>3. These things may properly be said to hold good in men, since they are compound by
nature, and consist of a body and a soul. But those who affirm that Ennoea was sent forth
from God, and Nous from Ennoea, and then, in succession, Logos from these, are, in the
first place, to be blamed as having improperly used these productions; and, in the next place,
as describing the affections, and passions, and mental tendencies of men, while they [thus
prove themselves] ignorant of God. By their manner of speaking, they ascribe those things
which apply to men to the Father of all, whom they also declare to be unknown to all; and
they deny that He himself made the world, to guard against attributing want of power397
to Him; while, at the same time, they endow Him with human affections and passions. But
if they had known the Scriptures, and been taught by the truth, they would have known,
beyond doubt, that God is not as men are; and that His thoughts are not like the thoughts
of men.398 For the Father of all is at a vast distance from those affections and passions which
operate among men. He is a simple, uncompounded Being, without diverse members,399
and altogether like, and equal to himself, since He is wholly understanding, and wholly
spirit, and wholly thought, and wholly intelligence, and wholly reason, and wholly hearing,
and wholly seeing, and wholly light, and the whole source of all that is good—even as the
religious and pious are wont to speak concerning God.</p>
<p>4. He is, however, above [all] these properties, and therefore indescribable. For He may
well and properly be called an Understanding which comprehends all things, but He is not
[on that account] like the understanding of men; and He may most properly be termed
Light, but He is nothing like that light with which we are acquainted. And so, in all other
particulars, the Father of all is in no degree similar to human weakness. He is spoken of in
these terms according to the love [we bear Him]; but in point of greatness, our thoughts
regarding Him transcend these expressions. If then, even in the case of human beings, un-

<pb n="972"/>
derstanding itself does not arise from emission, nor is that intelligence which produces
other things separated from the living man, while its motions and affections come into
manifestation, much more will the mind of God, who is all understanding, never by any
means be separated from Himself; nor can anything400 [in His case] be produced as if by a
different Being.</p>
<p>5. For if He produced intelligence, then He who did thus produce intelligence must be
understood, in accordance with their views, as a compound and corporeal Being; so that
God, who sent forth [the intelligence referred to], is separate from it, and the intelligence
which was sent forth separate [from Him]. But if they affirm that intelligence was sent forth
from intelligence, they then cut asunder the intelligence of God, and divide it into parts.
And whither has it gone? Whence was it sent forth? For whatever is sent forth from any
place, passes of necessity into some other. But what existence was there more ancient than
the intelligence of God, into which they maintain it was sent forth? And what a vast region
that must have been which was capable of receiving and containing the intelligence of God!
If, however, they affirm [that this emission took place] just as a ray proceeds from the sun,
then, as the subjacent air which receives the ray must have had an existence prior to it, so
[by such reasoning] they will indicate that there was something in existence, into which the
intelligence of God was sent forth, capable of containing it, and more ancient than itself.
Following upon this, we must hold that, as we see the sun, which is less than all things,
sending forth rays from himself to a great distance, so likewise we say that the Propator sent
forth a ray beyond, and to a great distance from, Himself. But what can be conceived of
beyond, or at a distance from, God, into which He sent forth this ray?</p>
<p>6. If, again, they affirm that that [intelligence] was not sent forth beyond the Father, but
within the Father Himself, then, in the first place, it becomes superfluous to say that it was
sent forth at all. For how could it have been sent forth if it continued within the Father? For
an emission is the manifestation of that which is emitted, beyond him who emits it. In the
next place, this [intelligence] being sent forth, both that Logos who springs from Him will
still be within the Father, as will also be the future emissions proceeding from Logos. These,
then, cannot in such a case be ignorant of the Father, since they are within Him; nor, being
all equally surrounded by the Father, can any one know Him less [than another] according
to the descending order of their emission. And all of them must also in an equal measure
continue impassible, since they exist in the bosom of their Father, and none of them can
ever sink into a state of degeneracy or degradation. For with the Father there is no degeneracy,
unless perchance as in a great circle a smaller is contained, and within this one again a
smaller; or unless they affirm of the Father, that, after the manner of a sphere or a square,
<note type="footnote">400 That is, His Nous, Ennoea, etc., can have no independent existence. The text fluctuates between “emittitur”
and “emittetur.”</note>

<pb n="973"/>
He contains within Himself on all sides the likeness of a sphere, or the production of the
rest of the Æons in the form of a square, each one of these being surrounded by that one
who is above him in greatness, and surrounding in turn that one who is after him in smallness;
and that on this account, the smallest and the last of all, having its place in the centre,
and thus being far separated from the Father, was really ignorant of the Propator. But if
they maintain any such hypothesis, they must shut up their Bythus within a definite form
and space, while He both surrounds others, and is surrounded by them; for they must of
necessity acknowledge that there is something outside of Him which surrounds Him. And
none the less will the talk concerning those that contain, and those that are contained, flow
on into infinitude; and all [the Æons] will most clearly appear to be bodies enclosed [by one
another].</p>
<p>7. Further, they must also confess either that He is mere vacuity, or that the entire universe
is within Him; and in that case all will in like degree partake of the Father. Just as, if
one forms circles in water, or round or square figures, all these will equally partake of water;
just as those, again, which are framed in the air, must necessarily partake of air, and those
which [are formed] in light, of light; so must those also who are within Him all equally
partake of the Father, ignorance having no place among them. Where, then, is this partaking
of the Father who fills [all things]? If, indeed, He has filled [all things], there will be no ignorance
among them. On this ground, then, their work of [supposed] degeneracy is brought
to nothing, and the production of matter with the formation of the rest of the world; which
things they maintain to have derived their substance from passion and ignorance. If, on the
other hand, they acknowledge that He is vacuity, then they fall into the greatest blasphemy;
they deny His spiritual nature. For how can He be a spiritual being, who cannot fill even
those things which are within Him?</p>
<p>8. Now, these remarks which have been made concerning the emission of intelligence
are in like manner applicable in opposition to those who belong to the school of Basilides,
as well as in opposition to the rest of the Gnostics, from whom these also (the Valentinians)
have adopted the ideas about emissions, and were refuted in the first book. But I have now
plainly shown that the first production of Nous, that is, of the intelligence they speak of, is
an untenable and impossible opinion. And let us see how the matter stands with respect to
the rest [of the Æons]. For they maintain that Logos and Zoe were sent forth by him (i.e.,
Nous) as fashioners of this Pleroma; while they conceive of an emission of Logos, that is,
the Word after the analogy of human feelings, and rashly form conjectures respecting God,
as if they had discovered something wonderful in their assertion that Logos was I produced
by Nous. All indeed have a clear perception that this may be logically affirmed with respect
to men.401 But in Him who is God over all, since He is all Nous, and all Logos, as I have
<note type="footnote">401 That is, in human beings no doubt, thought (Nous) precedes speech (Logos).</note>

<pb n="974"/>
said before, and has in Himself nothing more ancient or late than another, and nothing at
variance with another, but continues altogether equal, and similar, and homogeneous, there
is no longer ground for conceiving of such production in the order which has been mentioned.
Just as he does not err who declares that God is all vision, and all hearing (for in
what manner He sees, in that also He hears; and in what manner He hears, in that also He
sees), so also he who affirms that He is all intelligence, and all word, and that, in whatever
respect He is intelligence, in that also He is word, and that this Nous is His Logos, will still
indeed have only an inadequate conception of the Father of all, but will entertain far more
becoming [thoughts regarding Him] than do those who transfer the generation of the word
to which men gave utterance to the eternal Word of God, assigning a beginning and course
of production [to Him], even as they do to their own word. And in what respect will the
Word of God—yea, rather God Himself, since He is the Word—differ from the word of
men, if He follows the same order and process of generation?</p>
<p>9. They have fallen into error, too, respecting Zoe, by maintaining that she was produced
in the sixth place, when it behoved her to take precedence of all [the rest], since God is life,
and incorruption, and truth. And these and such like attributes have not been produced
according to a gradual scale of descent, but they are names of those perfections which always
exist in God, so far as it is possible and proper for men to hear and to speak of God. For
with the name of God the following words will harmonize: intelligence, word, life, incorruption,
truth, wisdom, goodness, and such like. And neither can any one maintain that intelligence
is more ancient than life, for intelligence itself is life; nor that life is later than intelligence,
so that He who is the intellect of all, that is God, should at one time have been destitute
of life. But if they affirm that life was indeed [previously] in the Father, but was produced
in the sixth place in order that the Word might live, surely it ought long before, [according
to such reasoning,] to have been sent forth, in the fourth place, that Nous might have life;
and still further, even before Him, [it should have been] with Bythus, that their Bythus might
live. For to reckon Sige, indeed, along with their Propator, and to assign her to Him as His
consort, while they do not join Zoe to the number,—is not this to surpass all other madness?</p>
<p>10. Again, as to the second production which proceeds from these [Æons who have
been mentioned],—that, namely, of Homo and Ecclesia,—their very fathers, falsely styled
Gnostics, strive among themselves, each one seeking to make good his own opinions, and
thus convicting themselves of being wicked thieves. They maintain that it is more suitable
to [the theory of] production— as being, in fact, truth-like—that the Word was produced
by man, and not man by the Word; and that man existed prior to the Word, and that this
is really He who is God over all. And thus it is, as I have previously remarked, that heaping
together with a kind of plausibility all human feelings, and mental exercises, and formation
of intentions, and utterances of words, they have lied with no plausibility at all against God.
For while they ascribe the things which happen to men, and whatsoever they recognise

<pb n="975"/>
themselves as experiencing, to the divine reason, they seem to those who are ignorant of
God to make statements suitable enough. And by these human passions, drawing away their
intelligence, while they describe the origin and production of the Word of God in the fifth
place, they assert that thus they teach wonderful mysteries, unspeakable and sublime, known
to no one but themselves. It was, [they affirm,] concerning these that the Lord said, “Seek,
and ye shall find,”402 that is, that they should inquire how Nous and Aletheia proceeded
from Bythus and Sage; whether Logos and Zoe again derive their origin from these and
then, whether Anthropos and Ecclesia proceed from Logos and Zoe.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Valentinus and his followers derived the principles of their
system from the heathen; the names only are changed.</head>
<p>1. Much more like the truth, and more pleasing, is the account which Antiphanes,403
one of the ancient comic poets, gives in his Theogony as to the origin of all things. For he
speaks Chaos as being produced from Night and Silence; relates that then Love404 sprang
from Chaos and Night; from this again, Light; and that from this, in his opinion, were derived
all the rest of the first generation of the gods. After these he next introduces a second generation
of gods, and the creation of the world; then he narrates the formation of mankind by
the second order of the gods. These men (the heretics), adopting this fable as their own,
have ranged their opinions round it, as if by a sort of natural process, changing only the
names of the things referred to, and setting forth the very same beginning of the generation
of all things, and their production. In place of Night and Silence they substitute Bythus and
Sige; instead of Chaos, they put Nous; and for Love (by whom, says the comic poet, all other
things were set in order) they have brought forward the Word; while for the primary and
greatest gods they have formed the Æons; and in place of the secondary gods, they tell us
of that creation by their mother which is outside of the Pleroma, calling it the second Ogdoad.
They proclaim to us, like the writer referred to, that from this (Ogdoad) came the creation
of the world and the formation of man, maintaining that they alone are acquainted with
these ineffable and unknown mysteries. Those things which are everywhere acted in the
theatres by comedians with the clearest voices they transfer to their own system, teaching
them undoubtedly through means of the same arguments, and merely changing the names.</p>
<p>2. And not only are they convicted of bringing forward, as if their own [original ideas],
those things which are to be found among the comic poets, but they also bring together the
things which have been said by all those who were ignorant of God, and who are termed
philosophers; and sewing together, as it were, a motley garment out of a heap of miserable
rags, they have, by their subtle manner of expression, furnished themselves with a cloak
which is really not their own. They do, it is true, introduce a new kind of doctrine, inasmuch
as by a new sort of art it has been substituted [for the old]. Yet it is in reality both old and
useless, since these very opinions have been sewed together out of ancient dogmas redolent
of ignorance and irreligion. For instance, Thales405 of Miletus affirmed that water was the

generative and initial principle of all things. Now it is just the same thing whether we say
water or Bythus. The poet Homer,406 again, held the opinion that Oceanus, along with
mother Tethys, was the origin of the gods: this idea these men have transferred to Bythus
and Sige. Anaximander laid it down that infinitude is the first principle of all things, having
seminally in itself the generation of them all, and from this he declares the immense worlds
[which exist] were formed: this, too, they have dressed up anew, and referred to Bythus and
their Æons. Anaxagoras, again, who has also been surnamed “Atheist,” gave it as his opinion
that animals were formed from seeds falling down from heaven upon earth. This thought,
too, these men have transferred to “the seed” of their Mother, which they maintain to be
themselves; thus acknowledging at once, in the judgment of such as are possessed of sense,
that they themselves are the offspring of the irreligious Anaxagoras.</p>
<p>3. Again, adopting the [ideas of] shade and vacuity from Democritus and Epicurus, they
have fitted these to their own views, following upon those [teachers] who had already talked
a great deal about a vacuum and atoms, the one of which they called that which is, and the
other that which is not. In like manner, these men call those things which are within the
Pleroma real existences, just as those philosophers did the atoms; while they maintain that
those which are without the Pleroma have no true existence, even as those did respecting
the vacuum. They have thus banished themselves in this world (since they are here outside
of the Pleroma) into a place which has no existence. Again, when they maintain that these
things [below] are images of those which have a true existence [above], they again most
manifestly rehearse the doctrine of Democritus and Plato. For Democritus was the first who
maintained that numerous and diverse figures were stamped, as it were, with the forms [of
things above], and descended from universal space into this world. But Plato, for his part,
speaks of matter, and exemplar,407 and God. These men, following those distinctions, have
styled what he calls ideas, and exemplar, the images of those things which are above; while,
through a mere change of name, they boast themselves as being discoverers and contrivers
of this kind of imaginary fiction.</p>
<p>4. This opinion, too, that they hold the Creator formed the world out of previously existing
matter, both Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and Plato expressed before them; as, forsooth,
we learn they also do under the inspiration of their Mother. Then again, as to the opinion
that everything of necessity passes away to those things out of which they maintain it was
also formed, and that God is the slave of this necessity, so that He cannot impart immortality
to what is mortal, or bestow incorruption on what is corruptible, but every one passes into
a substance similar in nature to itself, both those who are named Stoics from the portico

(st??), and indeed all that are ignorant of God, poets and historians alike, make the same
affirmation.408 Those [heretics] who hold the same [system of] infidelity have ascribed, no
doubt, their own proper region to spiritual beings,—that, namely, which is within the Pleroma,
but to animal beings the intermediate space, while to corporeal they assign that which
is material. And they assert that God Himself can do no otherwise, but that every one of the
[different kinds of substance] mentioned passes away to those things which are of the same
nature [with itself].</p>
<p>5. Moreover, as to their saying that the Saviour was formed out of all the Æons, by every
one of them depositing, so to speak, in Him his own special flower, they bring forward
nothing new that may not be found in the Pandora of Hesiod. For what he says respecting
her, these men insinuate concerning the Saviour, bringing Him before us as Pandoros (Allgifted),
as if each of the Æons had bestowed on Him what He possessed in the greatest perfection.
Again, their opinion as to the indifference of [eating of] meats and other actions,
and as to their thinking that, from the nobility of their nature, they can in no degree at all
contract pollution, whatever they eat or perform, they have derived it from the Cynics, since
they do in fact belong to the same society as do these [philosophers]. They also strive to
transfer to [the treatment of matters of] faith that hairsplitting and subtle mode of handling
questions which is, in fact, a copying of Aristotle.</p>
<p>6. Again, as to the desire they exhibit to refer this whole universe to numbers, they have
learned it from the Pythagoreans. For these were the first who set forth numbers as the initial
principle of all things, and [described] that initial principle of theirs as being both equal and
unequal, out of which [two properties] they conceived that both things sensible409 and immaterial
derived their origin. And [they held] that one set of first principles410 gave rise to
the matter [of things], and another to their form. They affirm that from these first principles

of intellect.”</note>
<note type="footnote">410 This clause is very obscure, and we are not sure if the above rendering brings out the real meaning of the

<pb n="979"/>
all things have been made, just as a statue is of its metal and its special form. Now, the
heretics have adapted this to the things which are outside of the Pleroma. The [Pythagoreans]
maintained that the411 principle of intellect is proportionate to the energy wherewith mind,
as a recipient of the comprehensible, pursues its inquiries, until, worn out, it is resolved at
length in the Indivisible and One. They further affirm that Hen—that is, One—is the first
principle of all things, and the substance of all that has been formed. From this again proceeded
the Dyad, the Tetrad, the Pentad, and the manifold generation of the others. These
things the heretics repeat, word for word, with a reference to their Pleroma and Bythus.
From the same source, too, they strive to bring into vogue those conjunctions which proceed
from unity. Marcus boasts of such views as if they were his own, and as if he were seen to
have discovered something more novel than others, while he simply sets forth the Tetrad
of Pythagoras as the originating principle and mother of all things.</p>
<p>7. But I will merely say, in opposition to these men —Did all those who have been
mentioned, with whom you have been proved to coincide in expression, know, or not know,
the truth? If they knew it, then the descent of the Saviour into this world was superfluous.
For why [in that case] did He descend? Was it that He might bring that truth which was
[already] known to the knowledge of those who knew it? If, on the other hand, these men
did not know it, then how is it that, while you express yourselves in the same terms as do
those who knew not the truth, ye boast that yourselves alone possess that knowledge which
is above all things, although they who are ignorant of God [likewise] possess it? Thus, then,
by a complete perversion412 of language, they style ignorance of the truth knowledge: and
Paul well says [of them,] that [they make use of] “novelties of words of false knowledge.”413
For that knowledge of theirs is truly found to be false. If, however, taking an impudent
course with respect to these points, they declare that men indeed did not know the truth,
but that their Mother,414 the seed of the Father, proclaimed the mysteries of truth through
such men, even as also through the prophets, while the Demiurge was ignorant [of the
proceeding], then I answer, in the first place, that the things which were predicted were not
of such a nature as to be intelligible to no one; for the men themselves knew what they were
saying, as did also their disciples, and those again succeeded these. And, in the next place,
if either the Mother or her seed knew and proclaimed those things which were of the truth
(and the Father415 is truth), then on their theory the Saviour spoke falsely when He said,

“No one knoweth the Father but the Son,”416 unless indeed they maintain that their seed
or Mother is No-one.</p>
<p>8. Thus far, then, by means of [ascribing to their Æons] human feelings, and by the fact
that they largely coincide in their language with many of those who are ignorant of God,
they have been seen plausibly drawing a certain number away [from the truth]. They lead
them on by the use of those [expressions] with which they have been familiar, to that sort
of discourse which treats of all things, setting forth the production of the Word of God, and
of Zoe, and of Nous, and bringing into the world, as it were, the [successive] emanations of
the Deity. The views, again, which they propound, without either plausibility or parade, are
simply lies from beginning to end. Just as those who, in order to lure and capture any kind
of animals, place their accustomed food before them, gradually drawing them on by means
of the familiar aliment, until at length they seize it, but, when they have taken them captive,
they subject them to the bitterest of bondage, and drag them along with violence whithersoever
they please; so also do these men gradually and gently persuading [others], by means
of their plausible speeches, to accept of the emission which has been mentioned, then bring
forward things which are not consistent, and forms of the remaining emissions which are
not such as might have been expected. They declare, for instance, that [ten]417 Æons were
sent forth by Logos and Zoe, while from Anthropos and Ecclesia there proceeded twelve,
although they have neither proof, nor testimony, nor probability, nor anything whatever of
such a nature [to support these assertions]; and with equal folly and audacity do they wish
it to be believed that from Logos and Zoe, being Æons, were sent forth Bythus and Mixis,
Ageratos and Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and
Macaria. Moreover, [as they affirm,] there were sent forth, in a similar way, from Anthropos
and Ecclesia, being Æons, Paracletus and Pistis, Patricos and Elpis, Metricos and Agape,
Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes, Theletos and Sophia.</p>
<p>9. The passions and error of this Sophia, and how she ran the risk of perishing through
her investigation [of the nature] of the Father, as they relate, and what took place outside
of the Pleroma, and from what sort of a defect they teach that the Maker of the world was
produced, I have set forth in the preceding book, describing in it, with all diligence, the
opinions of these heretics. [I have also detailed their views] respecting Christ, whom they
describe as having been produced subsequently to all these, and also regarding Soter, who,
[according to them,] derived his being from those Æons who were formed within the Pleroma.

surdity of their falsehood may be made manifest, and also the confused nature of the nomen-
clature they have devised. For they themselves detract from [the dignity of] their Æons by
a multitude of names of this sort. They give out names plausible and credible to the heathen,
[as being similar] to those who are called their twelve gods,419 and even these they will have
to be images of their twelve Æons. But the images [so called] can produce names [of their
own] much more seemly, and more powerful through their etymology to indicate divinity
[than are those of their fancied prototypes].</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—No account can be given of these productions.</head>
<p>1. But let us return to the fore-mentioned question as to the production [of the Æons].
And, in the first place, let them tell us the reason of the production of the Æons being of
such a kind that they do not come in contact with any of those things which belong to creation.
For they maintain that those things [above] were not made on account of creation,
but creation on account of them; and that the former are not images of the latter, but the
latter of the former. As, therefore, they render a reason for the images, by saying that the
month has thirty days on account of the thirty Æons, and the day twelve hours, and the year
twelve months, on account of the twelve Æons which are within the Pleroma, with other
such nonsense of the same kind, let them now tell us also the reason for that production of
the Æons, why it was of such a nature, for what reason the first and first-begotten Ogdoad
was sent forth, and not a Pentad, or a Triad, or a Septenad, or any one of those which are
defined by a different number? Moreover, how did it come to pass, that from Logos and
Zoe were sent forth ten Æons, and neither more nor less; while again from Anthropos and
Ecclesia proceeded twelve, although these might have been either more or less numerous?</p>
<p>2. And then, again, with reference to the entire Pleroma, what reason is there that it
should be divided into these three —an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad—and not into
some other number different from these? Moreover, with respect to the division itself, why
has it been made into three parts, and not into four, or five, or six, or into some other
number among those which have no connection with such numbers420 as belong to creation?
For they describe those [Æons above] as being more ancient than these [created things below],
and it behoves them to possess their principle [of being] in themselves, one which existed
before creation, and not after the pattern of creation, all exactly agreeing as to the point.421</p>
<p>3. The account which we give of creation is one harmonious with that regular order [of
things prevailing in the world], for this scheme of ours is adapted to the422 things which
have [actually] been made; but it is a matter of necessity that they, being unable to assign
any reason belonging to the things themselves, with regard to those beings that existed before
[creation], and were perfected by themselves, should fall into the greatest perplexity. For,
as to the points on which they interrogate us as knowing nothing of creation, they themselves,
when questioned in turn respecting the Pleroma, either make mention of mere human
feelings, or have recourse to that sort of speech which bears only upon that harmony observable
in creation, improperly giving us replies concerning things which are secondary, and
<note type="footnote">420 Referring to numbers like 4, 5, 6, which do not correspond to any important fact in creation, as 7 e.g.,

<pb n="983"/>
not concerning those which, as they maintain, are primary. For we do not question them
concerning that harmony which belongs to creation, nor concerning human feelings; but
because they must acknowledge, as to their octiform, deciform, and duodeciform Pleroma
(the image of which they declare creation to be), that their Father formed it of that figure
vainly and thoughtlessly, and must ascribe to Him deformity, if He made anything without
a reason. Or, again, if they declare that the Pleroma was so produced in accordance with
the foresight of the Father, for the sake of creation, as if He had thus symmetrically arranged
its very essence, then it follows that the Pleroma can no longer be regarded as having been
formed on its own account, but for the sake of that [creation] which was to be its image as
possessing its likeness (just as the clay model is not moulded for its own sake, but for the
sake of the statue in brass, or gold, or silver about to be formed), then creation will have
greater honour than the Pleroma, if, for its sake, those things [above] were produced.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Creator of the world either produced of Himself the images
of things to be made, or the Pleroma was formed after the image of some previous
system; and so on ad infinitum.</head>
<p>1. But if they will not yield assent to any one of these conclusions, since in that case they
would be proved by us as incapable of rendering any reason for such a production of their
Pleroma, they will of necessity be shut up to this—that they confess that, above the Pleroma,
there was some other system more spiritual and more powerful, after the image of which
their Pleroma was formed. For if the Demiurge did not of himself construct that figure of
creation which exists, but made it after the form of those things which are above, then from
whom did their Bythus—who, to be sure, brought it about that the Pleroma should be possessed
of a configuration of this kind—receive the figure of those things which existed before
Himself? For it must needs be, either that the intention [of creating] dwelt in that god who
made the world, so that of his own power, and from himself, he obtained the model of its
formation; or, if any departure is made from this being, then there will arise a necessity for
constantly asking whence there came to that one who is above him the configuration of
those things which have been made; what, too, was the number of the productions; and
what the substance of the model itself? If, however, it was in the power of Bythus to impart
of himself such a configuration to the Pleroma, then why may it not have been in the power
of the Demiurge to form of himself such a world as exists? And then, again, if creation be
an image of those things [above], why should we not affirm that those are, in turn, images
of others above them, and those above these again, of others, and thus go on supposing innumerable
images of images?</p>
<p>2. This difficulty presented itself to Basilides after he had utterly missed the truth, and
was conceiving that, by an infinite succession of those beings that were formed from one
another, he might escape such perplexity. When he had proclaimed that three hundred and
sixty-five heavens were formed through succession and similitude by one another, and that
a manifest proof [of the existence] of these was found in the number of the days of the year,
as I stated before; and that above these there was a power which they also style Unnameable,
and its dispensation—he did not even in this way escape such perplexity. For, when asked
whence came the image of its configuration to that heaven which is above all, and from
which he wishes the rest to be regarded as having been formed by means of succession, he
will say, from that dispensation which belongs to the Unnameable. He must then say, either
that the Unspeakable formed it of himself, or he will find it necessary to acknowledge that
there is some other power above this being, from whom his unnameable One derived such
vast numbers of configurations as do, according to him, exist.</p>
<p>3. How much safer and more accurate a course is it, then, to confess at once that which
is true: that this God, the Creator, who formed the world, is the only God, and that there is
no other God besides Him—He Himself receiving from Himself the model and figure of

<pb n="985"/>
those things which have been made—than that, after wearying ourselves with such an impious
and circuitous description, we should be compelled, at some point or another, to fix the
mind on some One, and to confess that from Him proceeded the configuration of things
created.</p>
<p>4. As to the accusation brought against us by the followers of Valentinus, when they
declare that we continue in that Hebdomad which is below, as if we could not lift our minds
on high, nor understand those things which are above, because we do not accept their
monstrous assertions: this very charge do the followers of Basilides bring in turn against
them, inasmuch as they (the Valentinians) keep circling about those things which are below,
[going] as far as the first and second Ogdoad, and because they unskilfully imagine that,
immediately after the thirty Æons, they have discovered Him who is above all things Father,
not following out in thought their investigations to that Pleroma which is above the three
hundred and sixty-five heavens, which423 is above forty-five Ogdoads. And any one, again,
might bring against them the same charge, by imagining four thousand three hundred and
eighty heavens, or Æons, since the days of the year contain that number of hours. If, again,
some one adds also the nights, thus doubling the hours which have been mentioned, imagining
that [in this way] he has discovered a great multitude of Ogdoads, and a kind of innumerable
company424 of Æons, and thus, in opposition to Him who is above all things
Father, conceiving himself more perfect than all [others], he will bring the same charge
against all, inasmuch as they are not capable of rising to the conception of such a multitude
of heavens or Æons as he has announced, but are either so deficient as to remain among
those things which are below, or continue in the intermediate space.</p>
<note type="footnote">423 The text is here doubtful: Harvey proposes to read “qui” instead of “quæ,” but we prefer “quod” with

<head>Chapter XVII.—Inquiry into the production of the Æons: whatever its supposed
nature, it is in every respect inconsistent; and on the hypothesis of the heretics,
even Nous and the Father Himself would be stained with ignorance.</head>
<p>1. That system, then, which has respect to their Pleroma, and especially that part of it
which refers to the primary Ogdoad being thus burdened with so great contradictions and
perplexities, let me now go on to examine the remainder of their scheme. [In doing so] on
account of their madness, I shall be making inquiry respecting things which have no real
existence; yet it is necessary to do this, since the treatment of this subject has been entrusted
to me, and since I desire all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, as well as because
thou thyself hast asked to receive from me full and complete means for overturning [the
views of] these men.</p>
<p>2. I ask, then, in what manner were the rest of the Æons produced? Was it so as to be
united with Him who produced them, even as the solar rays are with the sun; or was it actually425
and separately, so that each of them possessed an independent existence and his own
special form, just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle from another? Or
was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a tree? And were they of the same
substance with those who produced them, or did they derive their substance from some
other [kind of] substance? Also, were they produced at the same time, so as to be contemporaries;
or after a certain order, so that some of them were older, and others younger? And,
again, are they uncompounded and uniform, and altogether equal and similar among
themselves, as spirit and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike
[to each other] in their members?</p>
<p>3. If each of them was produced, after the manner of men, actually and according to its
own generation, then either those thus generated by the Father will be of the same substance
with Him, and similar to their Author; or if426 they appear dissimilar, then it must of necessity
be acknowledged that they are [formed] of some different substance. Now, if the beings
generated by the Father be similar to their Author, then those who have been produced
must remain for ever impassible, even as is He who produced them; but if, on the other
hand, they are of a different substance, which is capable of passion, then whence came this
dissimilar substance to find a place within the incorruptible Pleroma? Further, too, according
to this principle, each one of them must be understood as being completely separated from
every other, even as men are not mixed with nor united the one to the other, but each having
a distinct shape of his own, and a definite sphere of action, while each one of them, too, is
formed of a particular size, —qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a spirit. Let them
<note type="footnote">425 Efficabiliter in the Latin text is thought to correspond to ??e???? in the original Greek.</note>
<note type="footnote">426 Si is inserted by most of the editors; and although Harvey argues for its omission, we agree with Massuet
in deeming it indispensable.</note>

<pb n="987"/>
therefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being spiritual, or of themselves as “spiritual,”
if indeed their Æons sit feasting with the Father, just as if they were men, and He Himself
is of such a configuration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by Him.</p>
<p>4. If, again, the Æons were derived from Logos, Logos from Nous, and Nous from
Bythus, just as lights are kindled from a light—as, for example, torches are from a torch—then
they may no doubt differ in generation and size from one another; but since they are of the
same substance with the Author of their production, they must either all remain for ever
impassible, or their Father Himself must participate in passion. For the torch which has
been kindled subsequently cannot be possessed of a different kind of light from that which
preceded it. Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the original identity,
since that one light is then formed which has existed even from the beginning. But we cannot
speak, with respect to light itself, of some part being more recent in its origin, and another
being more ancient (for the whole is but one light); nor can we so speak even in regard to
those torches which have received the light (for these are all contemporary as respects their
material substance, for the substance of torches is one and the same), but simply as to [the
time of] its being kindled, since one was lighted a little while ago, and another has just now
been kindled.</p>
<p>5. The defect, therefore, of that passion which has regard to ignorance, will either attach
alike to their whole Pleroma, since [all its members] are of the same substance; and the
Propator will share in this defect of ignorance—that is, will be ignorant of Himself; or, on
the other hand, all those lights which are within the Pleroma will alike remain for ever impassible.
Whence, then, comes the passion of the youngest Æon, if the light of the Father is
that from which all other lights have been formed, and which is by nature impassible? And
how can one Æon be spoken of as either younger or older among themselves, since there
is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And if any one calls them stars, they will all nevertheless
appear to participate in the same nature. For if “one star differs from another star in glory,”427
but not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact of being passible or impassible; so all these,
since they are alike derived from the light of the Father, must either be naturally impassible
and immutable, or they must all, in common with the light of the Father, be passible, and
are capable of the varying phases of corruption.</p>
<p>6. The same conclusion will follow, although they affirm that the production of Æons
sprang from Logos, as branches from a tree, since Logos has his generation from their
Father. For all [the Æons] are formed of the same substance with the Father, differing from
one another only in size, and not in nature, and filling up the greatness of the Father, even
<note type="footnote">427 1 Cor. xv. 41.</note>

<pb n="988"/>
as the fingers complete the hand. If therefore He exists in passion and ignorance, so must
also those Æons who have been generated by Him. But if it is impious to ascribe ignorance
and passion to the Father of all, how can they describe an Æon produced by Him as being
passible; and while they ascribe the same impiety to the very wisdom (Sophia) of God, how
can they still call themselves religious men?</p>
<p>7. If, again, they declare that their Æons were sent forth just as rays are from the sun,
then, since all are of the same substance and sprung from the same source, all must either
be capable of passion along with Him who produced them, or all will remain impassible for
ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of beings so produced, some are impassible and
others passible. If, then, they declare all impassible, they do themselves destroy their own
argument. For how could the youngest Æon have suffered passion if all were impassible?
If, on the other hand, they declare that all partook of this passion, as indeed some of them
venture to maintain, then, inasmuch as it originated with Logos,428 but flowed onwards to
Sophia, they will thus be convicted of tracing back the passion to Logos, who is the429 Nous
of this Propator, and so acknowledging the Nous of the Propator and the Father Himself
to have experienced passion. For the Father of all is not to be regarded as a kind of compound
Being, who can be separated from his Nous (mind), as I have already shown; but Nous is
the Father, and the Father Nous. It necessarily follows, therefore, both that he who springs
from Him as Logos, or rather that Nous himself, since he is Logos, must be perfect and impassible,
and that those productions which proceed from him, seeing that they are of the
same substance with himself, should be perfect and impassible, and should ever remain
similar to him who produced them.</p>
<p>8. It cannot therefore longer be held, as these men teach, that Logos, as occupying the
third place in generation, was ignorant of the Father. Such a thing might indeed perhaps be
deemed probable in the case of the generation of human beings, inasmuch as these frequently
know nothing of their parents; but it is altogether impossible in the case of the Logos of the
Father. For if, existing in the Father, he knows Him in whom he exists—that is, is not ignorant
of himself—then those productions which issue from him being his powers (faculties), and
always present with him, will not be ignorant of him who emitted them, any more than rays
[may be supposed to be] of the sun. It is impossible, therefore, that the Sophia (wisdom) of
God, she who is within the Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been produced in such a manner,
should have fallen under the influence of passion, and conceived such ignorance. But it is
possible that that Sophia (wisdom) who pertains to [the scheme] of Valentinus, inasmuch
as she is a production of the devil, should fall into every kind of passion, and exhibit the

profoundest ignorance. For when they themselves bear testimony concerning their mother,
to the effect that she was the offspring of an erring Æon, we need no longer search for a
reason why the sons of such a mother should be ever swimming in the depths of ignorance.</p>
<p>9. I am not aware that, besides these productions [which have been mentioned], they
are able to speak of any other; indeed, they have not been known to me (although I have
had very frequent discussions with them concerning forms of this kind) as ever setting forth
any other peculiar kind of being as produced [in the manner under consideration]. This
only they maintain, that each one of these was so produced as to know merely that one who
produced him, while he was ignorant of the one who immediately preceded. But they do
not in this matter go forward [in their account] with any kind of demonstration as to the
manner in which these were produced, or how such a thing could take place among spiritual
beings. For, in whatsoever way they may choose to go forward, they will feel themselves
bound (while, as regards the truth, they depart430 entirely from right reason) to proceed so
far as to maintain that their Word, who springs from the Nous of the Propator, —to maintain,
I say, that he was produced in a state of degeneracy. For [they hold] that perfect Nous, previously
begotten by the perfect Bythus, was not capable of rendering that production which
issued from him perfect, but [could only bring it forth] utterly blind to the knowledge and
greatness of the Father. They also maintain that the Saviour exhibited an emblem of this
mystery in the case of that man who was blind from his birth,431 since the Æon was in this
manner produced by Monogenes blind, that is, in ignorance, thus falsely ascribing ignorance
and blindness to the Word of God, who, according to their own theory, holds the second
[place of] production from the Propator. Admirable sophists, and explorers of the sublimities
of the unknown Father, and rehearsers of those super-celestial mysteries “which the angels
desire to look into!”432—that they may learn that from the Nous of that Father who is above
all, the Word was produced blind, that is, ignorant of the Father who produced him!</p>
<p>10. But, ye miserable sophists, how could the Nous of the Father, or rather the very
Father Himself, since He is Nous and perfect in all things, have produced his own Logos as
an imperfect and blind Æon, when He was able also to produce along with him the knowledge
of the Father? As ye affirm that Christ was generated433 after the rest, and yet declare that
he was produced perfect, much more then should Logos, who is anterior to him in age, be
produced by the same Nous, unquestionably perfect, and not blind; nor could he, again,

have produced Æons still blinder than himself, until at last your Sophia, always utterly
blinded, gave birth to so vast a body of evils. And your Father is the cause of all this mischief;
for ye declare the magnitude and power of your Father to be the causes of ignorance, assimilating
Him to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him who is the unnameable Father.
But if ignorance is an evil, and ye declare all evils to have derived their strength from it,
while ye maintain that the greatness and power of the Father is the cause of this ignorance,
ye do thus set Him forth as the author of [all] evils. For ye state as the cause of evil this fact,
that [no one] could contemplate His greatness. But if it was really impossible for the Father
to make Himself known from the beginning to those [beings] that were formed by Him, He
must in that case be held free from blame, inasmuch as He could not remove the ignorance
of those who came after Him. But if, at a subsequent period, when He so willed it, He could
take away that ignorance which had increased with the successive productions as they followed
each other, and thus become deeply seated in the Æons, much more, had He so willed
it might He formerly have prevented that ignorance, which as yet was not, from coming
into existence.</p>
<p>11. Since therefore, as soon as He so pleased, He did become known not only to the
Æons, but also to these men who lived in these latter times; but, as He did not so please to
be known from the beginning, He remained unknown—the cause of ignorance is, according
to you, the will of the Father. For if He foreknew that these things would in future happen
in such a manner, why then did He not guard against the ignorance of these beings before
it had obtained a place among them, rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of repentance,
deal with it through the production of Christ? For the knowledge which through
Christ He conveyed to all, He might long before have imparted through Logos, who was
also the first-begotten of Monogenes. Or if, knowing them beforehand, He willed that these
things should happen [as they have done], then the works of ignorance must endure for
ever, and never pass away. For the things which have been made in accordance with the will
of your Propator must continue along with the will of Him who willed them; or if they pass
away, the will of Him also who decreed that they should have a being will pass away along
with them. And why did the Æons find rest and attain perfect knowledge through learning
[at last] that the Father is altogether434 incomprehensible? They might surely have possessed
this knowledge before they became involved in passion; for the greatness of the Father did
not suffer diminution from the beginning, so that these might435 know that He was altogether
incomprehensible. For if, on account of His infinite greatness, He remained unknown, He
ought also on account of His infinite love to have preserved those impassible who were

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Sophia was never really in ignorance or passion; her Enthymesis
could not have been separated from herself, or exhibited special tendencies of
its own.</head>
<p>1. How can it be regarded as otherwise than absurd, that they also affirm this Sophia
(wisdom) to have been involved in ignorance, and degeneracy, and passion? For these things
are alien and contrary to wisdom, nor can they ever be qualities belonging to it. For wherever
there is a want of foresight, and an ignorance of the course of utility, there wisdom does not
exist. Let them therefore no longer call this suffering Æon, Sophia, but let them give up
either her name or her sufferings. And let them, moreover, not call their entire Pleroma
spiritual, if this Æon had a place within it when she was involved in such a tumult of passion.
For even a vigorous soul, not to say a spiritual substance, would not pass through any such
experience.</p>
<p>2. And, again, how could her Enthymesis, going forth [from her] along with the passion,
have become a separate existence? For Enthymesis (thought) is understood in connection
with some person, and can never have an isolated existence by itself. For a bad Enthymesis
is destroyed and absorbed by a good one, even as a state of disease is by health. What, then,
was the sort of Enthymesis which preceded that of passion? [It was this]: to investigate the
[nature of] the Father, and to consider His greatness. But what did she afterwards become
persuaded of, and so was restored to health? [This, viz.], that the Father is incomprehensible,
and that He is past finding out. It was not, then, a proper feeling that she wished to know
the Father, and on this account she became passible; but when she became persuaded that
He is unsearchable, she was restored to health. And even Nous himself, who was inquiring
into the [nature of] the Father, ceased, according to them, to continue his researches, on
learning that the Father is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>3. How then could the Enthymesis separately conceive passions, which themselves also
were her affections? For affection is necessarily connected with an individual: it cannot
come into being or exist apart by itself. This opinion [of theirs], however, is not only untenable,
but also opposed to that which was spoken by our Lord: “Seek, and ye shall find.”436
For the Lord renders His disciples perfect by their seeking after and finding the Father; but
that Christ of theirs, who is above, has rendered them perfect, by the fact that He has commanded
the Æons not to seek after the Father, persuading them that, though they should
labour hard, they would not find Him. And they437 declare that they themselves are perfect,
by the fact that they maintain they have found their Bythus; while the Æons [have been
made perfect] through means of this, that He is unsearchable who was inquired after by
them.</p>
<note type="footnote">436 Matt. vii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">437 It seems necessary to read “se quidem” instead of “si quidem,” as in the mss.</note>

<pb n="993"/>
<p>4. Since, therefore, the Enthymesis herself could not exist separately, apart from the
Æon, [it is obvious that] they bring forward still greater falsehood concerning her passion,
when they further proceed to divide and separate it from her, while they declare that it was
the substance of matter. As if God were not light, and as if no Word existed who could
convict them, and overthrow their wickedness. For it is certainly true, that whatsoever the
Æon thought, that she also suffered; and what she suffered, that she also thought. And her
Enthymesis was, according to them, nothing else than the passion of one thinking how she
might comprehend the incomprehensible. And thus Enthymesis (thought) was the passion;
for she was thinking of things impossible. How then could affection and passion be separated
and set apart from the Enthymesis, so as to become the substance of so vast a material creation,
when Enthymesis herself was the passion, and the passion Enthymesis? Neither,
therefore, can Enthymesis apart from the Æon, nor the affections apart from Enthymesis,
separately possess substance; and thus once more their system breaks down and is destroyed.</p>
<p>5. But how did it come to pass that the Æon was both dissolved [into her component
parts], and became subject to passion? She was undoubtedly of the same substance as the
Pleroma; but the entire Pleroma was of the Father. Now, any substance, when brought in
contact with what is of a similar nature, will not be dissolved into nothing, nor will be in
danger of perishing, but will rather continue and increase, such as fire in fire, spirit in spirit,
and water in water; but those which are of a contrary nature to each other do, [when they
meet,] suffer and are changed and destroyed. And, in like manner, if there had been a production
of light, it would not suffer passion, or recur any danger in light like itself, but would
rather glow with the greater brightness, and increase, as the day does from [the increasing
brilliance of] the sun; for they maintain that Bythus [himself] was the image of their father438
(Sophia). Whatever animals are alien [in habits] and strange to each other, or are mutually
opposed in nature, fall into danger [on meeting together], and are destroyed; whereas, on
the other hand, those who are accustomed to each other, and of a harmonious disposition,
suffer no peril from being together in the same place, but rather secure both safety and life
by such a fact. If, therefore, this Æon was produced by the Pleroma of the same substance
as the whole of it, she could never have undergone change, since she was consorting with
beings similar to and familiar with herself, a spiritual essence among those that were spiritual.
For fear, terror, passion, dissolution, and such like, may perhaps occur through the struggle
of contraries among such beings as we are, who are possessed of bodies; but among spiritual
beings, and those that have the light diffused among them, no such calamities can possibly
happen. But these men appear to me to have endowed their Æon with the [same sort of]
passion as belongs to that character in the comic poet Menander,439 who was himself deeply
<note type="footnote">438 Although Sophia was a feminine Æon, she was regarded as being the father of Enthymesis, who again
was the mother of the Valentinians.</note>

<pb n="994"/>
in love, but an object of hatred [to his beloved]. For those who have invented such opinions
have rather had an idea and mental conception of some unhappy lover among men, than
of a spiritual and divine substance.</p>
<p>6. Moreover, to meditate how to search into [the nature of] the perfect Father, and to
have a desire to exist within Him, and to have a comprehension of His [greatness], could
not entail the stain of ignorance or passion, and that upon a spiritual Æon; but would rather
[give rise to] perfection, and impassibility, and truth. For they do not say that even they,
though they be but men, by meditating on Him who was before them,—and while now, as
it were, comprehending the perfect, and being placed within the knowledge of Him, —are
thus involved in a passion of perplexity, but rather attain to the knowledge and apprehension
of truth. For they affirm that the Saviour said, “Seek, and ye shall find,” to His disciples with
this view, that they should seek after Him who, by means of imagination, has been conceived
of by them as being above the Maker of all—the ineffable Bythus; and they desire themselves
to be regarded as “the perfect;” because they have sought and found the perfect One, while
they are still on earth. Yet they declare that that Æon who was within the Pleroma, a wholly
spiritual being, by seeking after the Propator, and endeavouring to find a place within His
greatness, and desiring to have a comprehension of the truth of the Father, fell down into
[the endurance of] passion, and such a passion that, unless she had met with that Power
who upholds all things, she would have been dissolved into the general substance [of the
Æons], and thus come to an end of her [personal] existence.</p>
<p>7. Absurd is such presumption, and truly an opinion of men totally destitute of the
truth. For, that this Æon is superior to themselves, and of greater antiquity, they themselves
acknowledge, according to their own system, when they affirm that they are the fruit of the
Enthymesis of that Æon who suffered passion, so that this Æon is the father of their mother,
that is, their own grandfather. And to them, the later grandchildren, the search after the
Father brings, as they maintain, truth, and perfection, and establishment, and deliverance
from unstable matter, and reconciliation to the Father; but on their grandfather this same
search entailed ignorance, and passion, and terror, and perplexity, from which [disturbances]
they also declare that the substance of matter was formed. To say, therefore, that the search
after and investigation of the perfect Father, and the desire for communion and union with
Him, were things quite beneficial to them, but to an Æon, from whom also they derive their
origin, these things were the cause of dissolution and destruction, how can such assertions
be otherwise viewed than as totally inconsistent, foolish, and irrational? Those, too, who
listen to these teachers, truly blind themselves, while they possess blind guides, justly [are
left to] fall along with them into the gulf of ignorance which lies below them.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Absurdities of the heretics as to their own origin: their opinions
respecting the Demiurge shown to be equally untenable and ridiculous.</head>
<p>1. But what sort of talk also is this concerning their seed—that it was conceived by the
mother according to the configuration of those angels who wait upon the Saviour,—shapeless,
without form, and imperfect; and that it was deposited in the Demiurge without his knowledge,
in order that through his instrumentality it might attain to perfection and form in
that soul which he had, [so to speak,] filled with seed? This is to affirm, in the first place,
that those angels who wait upon their Saviour are imperfect, and without figure or form; if
indeed that which was conceived according to their appearance was generated any such
kind of being [as has been described].</p>
<p>2. Then, in the next place, as to their saying that the Creator was ignorant of that deposit
of seed which took place into him, and again, of that impartation of seed which was made
by him to man, their words are futile and vain, and are in no way susceptible of proof. For
how could he have been ignorant of it, if that seed had possessed any substance and peculiar
properties? If, on the other hand, it was without substance and without quality, and so was
really nothing, then, as a matter of course, he was ignorant of it. For those things which
have a certain motion of their own, and quality, either of heat, or swiftness, or sweetness,
or which differ from others in brilliance, do not escape the notice even of men, since they
mingle in the sphere of human action: far less can they [be hidden from] God, the Maker
of this universe. With reason, however, [is it said, that] their seed was not known to Him,
since it is without any quality of general utility, and without the substance requisite for any
action, and is, in fact, a pure nonentity. It really seems to me, that, with a view to such
opinions, the Lord expressed Himself thus: “For every idle word that men speak, they shall
give account on the day of judgment.”440 For all teachers of a like character to these, who
fill men’s ears with idle talk, shall, when they stand at the throne of judgment, render an
account for those things which they have vainly imagined and falsely uttered against the
Lord, proceeding, as they have done, to such a height of audacity as to declare of themselves
that, on account of the substance of their seed, they are acquainted with the spiritual Pleroma,
because that man who dwells within reveals to them the true Father; for the animal nature
required441 to be disciplined by means of the senses. But [they hold that] the Demiurge,
while receiving into himself the whole of this seed, through its being deposited in him by
the Mother, still remained utterly ignorant of all things, and had no understanding of anything
connected with the Pleroma.</p>
<p>3. And that they are the truly “spiritual,” inasmuch as a certain particle of the Father of
the universe has been deposited in their souls, since, according to their assertions, they have

<note type="footnote">441 Comp. i. 6, 1.</note>

<pb n="996"/>
souls formed of the same substance as the Demiurge himself, yet that he, although he received
from the Mother, once for all, the whole [of the divine] seed, and possessed it in himself,
still remained of an animal nature, and had not the slightest understanding of those things
which are above, which things they boast that they themselves understand, while they are
still on earth;—does not this crown all possible absurdity? For to imagine that the very same
seed conveyed knowledge and perfection to the souls of these men, while it only gave rise
to ignorance in the God who made them, is an opinion that can be held only by those utterly
frantic, and totally destitute of common sense.</p>
<p>4. Further, it is also a most absurd and groundless thing for them to say that the seed
was, by being thus deposited, reduced to form and increased, and so was prepared for all
the reception of perfect rationality. For there will be in it an admixture of matter —that
substance which they hold to have been derived from ignorance and defect; [and this will
prove itself] more apt and useful than was the light of their Father, if indeed, when born,
according to the contemplation of that [light], it was without form or figure, but derived
from this [matter], form, and appearance, and increase, and perfection. For if that light
which proceeds from the Pleroma was the cause to a spiritual being that it possessed neither
form, nor appearance, nor its own special magnitude, while its descent to this world added
all these things to it, and brought it to perfection, then a sojourn here (which they also term
darkness) would seem much more efficacious and useful than was the light of their Father.
But how can it be regarded as other than ridiculous, to affirm that their mother ran the risk
of being almost extinguished in matter, and was almost on the point of being destroyed by
it, had she not then with difficulty stretched herself outwards, and leaped, [as it were,] out
of herself, receiving assistance from the Father; but that her seed increased in this same
matter, and received a form, and was made fit for the reception of perfect rationality; and
this, too, while “bubbling up” among substances dissimilar and unfamiliar to itself, according
to their own declaration that the earthly is opposed to the spiritual, and the spiritual to the
earthly? How, then, could “a little particle,”442 as they say, increase, and receive shape, and
reach perfection, in the midst of substances contrary to and unfamiliar to itself?</p>
<p>5. But further, and in addition to what has been said, the question occurs, Did their
mother, when she beheld the angels, bring forth the seed all at once, or only one by one [in
succession]? If she brought forth the whole simultaneously and at once, that which was thus
produced cannot now be of an infantile character: its descent, therefore, into those men
who now exist must be superfluous.443 But if one by one, then she did not form her conception
according to the figure of those angels whom she beheld; for, contemplating them all
<note type="footnote">442 “Parvum emissum”—a small emission.</note>
<note type="footnote">443 That is, there could be no need for its descending into them that it might increase, receive form, and thus
be prepared for the reception of perfect reason.</note>

<pb n="997"/>
together, and once for all, so as to conceive by them, she ought to have brought forth once
for all the offspring of those from whose forms she had once for all conceived.</p>
<p>6. Why was it, too, that, beholding the angels along with the Saviour, she did indeed
conceive their images, but not that of the Saviour, who is far more beautiful than they? Did
He not please her; and did she not, on that account, conceive after His likeness?444 How
was it, too, that the Demiurge, whom they can call an animal being, having, as they maintain,
his own special magnitude and figure, was produced perfect as respects his substance; while
that which is spiritual, which also ought to be more effective than that which is animal, was
sent forth imperfect, and he required to descend into a soul, that in it he might obtain form,
and thus becoming perfect, might be rendered fit for the reception of perfect reason? If,
then, he obtains form in mere earthly and animal men, he can no longer be said to be after
the likeness of angels whom they call lights, but [after the likeness] of those men who are
here below. For he will not possess in that case the likeness and appearance of angels, but
of those souls in whom also he receives shape; just as water when poured into a vessel takes
the form of that vessel, and if on any occasion it happens to congeal in it, it will acquire the
form of the vessel in which it has thus been frozen, since souls themselves possess the figure445
of the body [in which they dwell]; for they themselves have been adapted to the vessel [in
which they exist], as I have said before. If, then, that seed [referred to] is here solidified and
formed into a definite shape, it will possess the figure of a man. and not the form of the angels.
How is it possible, therefore, that that seed should be after images of the angels, seeing it
has obtained a form after the likeness of men? Why, again, since it was of a spiritual nature,
had it any need of descending into flesh? For what is carnal stands in need of that which is
spiritual, if indeed it is to be saved, that in it it may be sanctified and cleared from all impurity,
and that what is mortal may be swallowed up by immortality;446 but that which is spiritual
has no need whatever of those things which are here below. For it is not we who benefit
it, but it that improves us.</p>
<p>7. Still more manifestly is that talk of theirs concerning their seed proved to be false,
and that in a way which must be evident to every one, by the fact that they declare those
<note type="footnote">444 Or, “on beholding Him.”</note>

souls which have received seed from the Mother to be superior to all others; wherefore also
they have been honoured by the Demiurge, and constituted princes, and kings, and priests.
For if this were true, the high priest Caiaphas, and Annas, and the rest of the chief priests,
and doctors of the law, and rulers of the people, would have been the first to believe in the
Lord, agreeing as they did with respect447 to that relationship; and even before them should
have been Herod the king. But since neither he, nor the chief priests, nor the rulers, nor the
eminent of the people, turned to Him [in faith], but, on the contrary, those who sat begging
by the highway, the deaf, and the blind, while He was rejected and despised by others, according
to what Paul declares, “For ye see your calling, brethren, that there are not many
wise men among you, not many noble, not many mighty; but those things of the world
which were despised hath God chosen.”448 Such souls, therefore, were not superior to others
on account of the seed deposited in them, nor on this account were they honoured by the
Demiurge.</p>
<p>8. As to the point, then, that their system is weak and untenable as well as utterly chimerical,
enough has been said. For it is not needful, to use a common proverb, that one
should drink up the ocean who wishes to learn that its water is salt. But, just as in the case
of a statue which is made of clay, but coloured on the outside that it may be thought to be
of gold, while it really is of clay, any one who takes out of it a small particle, and thus laying
it open reveals the clay, will set free those who seek the truth from a false opinion; in the
same way have I (by exposing not a small part only, but the several heads of their system
which are of the greatest importance) shown to as many as do not wish wittingly to be led

the Valentinians, and all those other heretics who promulgate449 wicked opinions respecting
the Demiurge, that is, the Fashioner and Former of this universe, and who is in fact the only
true God—exhibiting, [as I have done,] how easily their views are overthrown.</p>
<p>9. For who that has any intelligence, and possesses only a small proportion of truth, can
tolerate them, when they affirm that there is another god above the Creator; and that there
is another Monogenes as well as another Word of God, whom also they describe as having
been produced in [a state of] degeneracy; and another Christ, whom they assert to have
been formed, along with the Holy Spirit, later than the rest of the Æons; and another Saviour,
who, they say, did not proceed from the Father of all, but was a kind of joint production of
<note type="footnote">447 The meaning apparently is, that by the high position which all these in common occupied, they proved
themselves, on the principles of the heretics, to belong to the favoured “seed,” and should therefore have eagerly

secured by faith in Christ.</note>

those Æons who were formed in [a state of] degeneracy, and that He was produced of necessity
on account of this very degeneracy? It is thus their opinion that, unless the Æons had
been in a state of ignorance and degeneracy, neither Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor Horos,
nor the Saviour, nor the angels, nor their Mother, nor her seed, nor the rest of the fabric of
the world, would have been produced at all; but the universe would have been a desert, and
destitute of the many good things which exist in it. They are therefore not only chargeable
with impiety against the Creator, declaring Him the fruit of a defect, but also against Christ
and the Holy Spirit, affirming that they were produced on account of that defect; and, in
like manner, that the Saviour [was produced] subsequently to [the existence of] that defect.
And who will tolerate the remainder of their vain talk, which they cunningly endeavour to
accommodate to the parables, and have in this way plunged both themselves, and those who
give credit to them, in the profoundest depths of impiety?</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Futility of the arguments adduced to demonstrate the sufferings
of the twelfth Æon, from the parables, the treachery of Judas, and the passion
of our Saviour.</head>
<p>1. That they improperly and illogically apply both the parables and the actions of the
Lord to their falsely-devised system, I prove as follows: They endeavour, for instance, to
demonstrate that passion which, they say, happened in the case of the twelfth Æon, from
this fact, that the passion of the Saviour was brought about by the twelfth apostle, and
happened in the twelfth month. For they hold that He preached [only] for one year after
His baptism. They maintain also that the same thing was clearly set forth in the case of her
who suffered from the issue of blood. For the woman suffered during twelve years, and
through touching the hem of the Saviour’s garment she was made whole by that power
which went forth from the Saviour, and which, they affirm, had a previous existence. For
that Power who suffered was stretching herself outwards and flowing into immensity, so
that she was in danger of being dissolved into the general substance [of the Æons]; but then,
touching the primary Tetrad, which is typified by the hem of the garment, she was arrested,
and ceased from her passion.</p>
<p>2. Then, again, as to their assertion that the passion of the twelfth Æon was proved
through the conduct of Judas, how is it possible that Judas can be compared [with this Æon]
as being an emblem of her—he who was expelled from the number of the twelve,450 and
never restored to his place? For that Æon, whose type they declare Judas to be, after being
separated from her Enthymesis, was restored or recalled [to her former position]; but Judas
was deprived [of his office], and cast out, while Matthias was ordained in his place, according
to what is written, “And his bishopric let another take.”451 They ought therefore to maintain
that the twelfth Æon was cast out of the Pleroma, and that another was produced, or sent
forth to fill her place; if, that is to say, she is pointed at in Judas. Moreover, they tell us that
it was the Æon herself who suffered, but Judas was the betrayer, [and not the sufferer.] Even
they themselves acknowledge that it was the suffering Christ, and not Judas, who came to
[the endurance of] passion. How, then, could Judas, the betrayer of Him who had to suffer
for our salvation, be the type and image of that Æon who suffered?</p>
<p>3. But, in truth, the passion of Christ was neither similar to the passion of the Æon, nor
did it take place in similar circumstances. For the Æon underwent a passion of dissolution
and destruction, so that she who suffered was in danger also of being destroyed. But the
Lord, our Christ, underwent a valid, and not a merely452 accidental passion; not only was
<note type="footnote">450 Or, “from the twelfth number”—the twelfth position among the apostles.</note>
<note type="footnote">451 Acts i. 20, from Ps. cix. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">452 The text is here uncertain. Most editions read “et quæ non cederet,” but Harvey prefers “quæ non accederet”
(for “accideret”), and remarks that the corresponding Greek would be ?a? ?? t????, which we have translated

<pb n="1001"/>
He Himself not in danger of being destroyed, but He also established fallen man453 by His
own strength, and recalled him to incorruption. The Æon, again, underwent passion while
she was seeking after the Father, and was not able to find Him; but the Lord suffered that
He might bring those who have wandered from the Father, back to knowledge and to His
fellowship. The search into the greatness of the Father became to her a passion leading to
destruction; but the Lord, having suffered, and bestowing the knowledge of the Father,
conferred on us salvation. Her passion, as they declare, gave origin to a female offspring,
weak, infirm, unformed, and ineffective; but His passion gave rise to strength and power.
For the Lord, through means of suffering, “ascending into the lofty place, led captivity captive,
gave gifts to men,”454 and conferred on those that believe in Him the power “to tread upon
serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy,”455 that is, of the leader of
apostasy. Our Lord also by His passion destroyed death, and dispersed error, and put an
end to corruption, and destroyed ignorance, while He manifested life and revealed truth,
and bestowed the gift of incorruption. But their Æon, when she had suffered, established456
ignorance, and brought forth a substance without shape, out of which all material works
have been produced—death, corruption, error, and such like.</p>
<p>4. Judas, then, the twelfth in order of the disciples, was not a type of the suffering Æon,
nor, again, was the passion of the Lord; for these two things have been shown to be in every
respect mutually dissimilar and inharmonious. This is the case not only as respects the
points which I have already mentioned, but with regard to the very number. For that Judas
the traitor is the twelfth in order, is agreed upon by all, there being twelve apostles mentioned
by name in the Gospel. But this Æon is not the twelfth, but the thirtieth; for, according to
the views under consideration, there were not twelve Æons only produced by the will of the
Father, nor was she sent forth the twelfth in order: they reckon her, [on the contrary,] as
having been produced in the thirtieth place. How, then, can Judas, the twelfth in order, be
the type and image of that Æon who occupies the thirtieth place?</p>
<p>5. But if they say that Judas in perishing was the image of her Enthymesis, neither in
this way will the image bear any analogy to that truth which [by hypothesis] corresponds
to it. For the Enthymesis having been separated from the Æon, and itself afterwards receiving
a shape from Christ,457 then being made a partaker of intelligence by the Saviour, and having

within the Pleroma, is said at last to have been received by them into the Pleroma, and, according
to [the principle of] conjunction, to have been united to that Saviour who was
formed out of all. But Judas having been once for all cast away, never returns into the
number of the disciples; otherwise a different person would not have been chosen to fill his
place. Besides, the Lord also declared regarding him, “Woe to the man by whom the Son of
man shall be betrayed;”458 and, “It were better for him if he had never been born;”459 and
he was called the “son of perdition”460 by Him. If, however, they say that Judas was a type
of the Enthymesis, not as separated from the Æon, but of the passion entwined with her,
neither in this way can the number twelve be regarded as a [fitting] type of the number
three. For in the one case Judas was cast away, and Matthias was ordained instead of him;
but in the other case the Æon is said to have been in danger of dissolution and destruction,
and [there are also] her Enthymesis and passion: for they markedly distinguish Enthymesis
from the passion; and they represent the Æon as being restored, and Enthymesis as acquiring
form, but the passion, when separated from these, as becoming matter. Since, therefore,
there are thus these three, the Æon, her Enthymesis, and her passion, Judas and Matthias,
being only two, cannot be the types of them.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The twelve apostles were not a type of the Æons.</head>
<p>1. If, again, they maintain that the twelve apostles were a type only of that group of
twelve Æons which Anthropos in conjunction with Ecclesia produced, then let them produce
ten other apostles as a type of those ten remaining Æons, who, as they declare, were produced
by Logos and Zoe. For it is unreasonable to suppose that the junior, and for that reason inferior
Æons, were set forth by the Saviour through the election of the apostles, while their
seniors, and on this account their superiors, were not thus foreshown; since the Saviour (if,
that is to say, He chose the apostles with this view, that by means of them He might show
forth the Æons who are in the Pleroma) might have chosen other ten apostles also, and
likewise other eight before these, that thus He might set forth the original and primary Ogdoad.
He could not,461 in regard to the second [Duo] Decad, show forth [any emblem of
it] through the number of the apostles being [already] constituted a type. For [He made
choice of no such other number of disciples; but] after the twelve apostles, our Lord is found
to have sent seventy others before Him.462 Now seventy cannot possibly be the type either
of an Ogdoad, a Decad, or a Triacontad. What is the reason, then, that the inferior Æons
are, as I have said, represented by means of the apostles; but the superior, from whom, too,
the former derived their being, are not prefigured at all? But if463 the twelve apostles were
chosen with this object, that the number of the twelve Æons might be indicated by means
of them, then the seventy also ought to have been chosen to be the type of seventy Æons;
and in that case, they must affirm that the Æons are no longer thirty, but eighty-two in
number. For He who made choice of the apostles, that they might be a type of those Æons
existing in the Pleroma, would never have constituted them types of some and not of others;
but by means of the apostles He would have tried to preserve an image and to exhibit a type
of those Æons that exist in the Pleroma.</p>
<p>2. Moreover we must not keep silence respecting Paul, but demand from them after the
type of what Æon that apostle has been handed down to us, unless perchance [they affirm
that he is a representative] of the Saviour compounded of them [all], who derived his being
from the collected gifts of the whole, and whom they term All Things, as having been formed
out of them all. Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself,
styling him Pandora —that is, “The gift of all”—for this reason, that the best gift in the

astray, that such should believe their falsehoods. For their Mother—that is, Leto467—secretly
stirred them up (whence also she is called Leto,468 according to the meaning of the Greek
word, because she secretly stirred up men), without the knowledge of the Demiurge, to give
forth profound and unspeakable mysteries to itching ears.469 And not only did their
Mother bring it about that this mystery should be declared by Hesiod; but very skilfully also
by means of the lyric poet Pindar, when he describes to the Demiurge470 the case of Pelops,
whose flesh was cut in pieces by the Father, and then collected and brought together, and
compacted anew by all the gods,471 did she in this way indicate Pandora and these men

<head>Chapter XXII.—The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was
baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His
baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died.</head>
<p>1. I have shown that the number thirty fails them in every respect; too few Æons, as they
represent them, being at one time found within the Pleroma, and then again too many [to
correspond with that number]. There are not, therefore, thirty Æons, nor did the Saviour
come to be baptized when He was thirty years old, for this reason, that He might show forth
the thirty silent473 Æons of their system, otherwise they must first of all separate and eject
[the Saviour] Himself from the Pleroma of all. Moreover, they affirm that He suffered in
the twelfth month, so that He continued to preach for one year after His baptism; and they
endeavour to establish this point out of the prophet (for it is written, “To proclaim the acceptable
year of the Lord, and the day of retribution”474), being truly blind, inasmuch as
they affirm they have found out the mysteries of Bythus, yet not understanding that which
is called by Isaiah the acceptable year of the Lord, nor the day of retribution. For the
prophet neither speaks concerning a day which includes the space of twelve hours, nor of
a year the length of which is twelve months. For even they themselves acknowledge that the
prophets have very often expressed themselves in parables and allegories, and [are] not [to
be understood] according to the mere sound of the words.</p>
<p>2. That, then, was called the day of retribution on which the Lord will render to every
one according to his works—that is, the judgment. The acceptable year of the Lord, again,
is this present time, in which those who believe Him are called by Him, and become acceptable
to God—that is, the whole time from His advent onwards to the consummation [of all
things], during which He acquires to Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who
are saved. For, according to the phraseology of the prophet, the day of retribution follows
the [acceptable] year; and the prophet will be proved guilty of falsehood if the Lord preached
only for a year, and if he speaks of it. For where is the day of retribution? For the year has
passed, and the day of retribution has not yet come; but He still “makes His sun to rise upon
the good and upon the evil, and sends rain upon the just and unjust.”475 And the righteous
suffer persecution, are afflicted, and are slain, while sinners are possessed of abundance,
and “drink with the sound of the harp and psaltery, but do not regard the works of the
Lord.”476 But, according to the language [used by the prophet], they ought to be combined,

and the day of retribution to follow the [acceptable] year. For the words are, “to proclaim
the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of retribution.” This present time, therefore, in
which men are called and saved by the Lord, is properly understood to be denoted by “the
acceptable year of the Lord;” and there follows on this “the day of retribution,” that is, the
judgment. And the time thus referred to is not called “a year” only, but is also named “a
day” both by the prophet and by Paul, of whom the apostle, calling to mind the Scripture,
says in the Epistle addressed to the Romans, “As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all
the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.”477 But here the expression “all the
day long” is put for all this time during which we suffer persecution, and are killed as sheep.
As then this day does not signify one which consists of twelve hours, but the whole time
during which believers in Christ suffer and are put to death for His sake, so also the year
there mentioned does not denote one which consists of twelve months, but the whole time
of faith during which men hear and believe the preaching of the Gospel, and those become
acceptable to God who unite themselves to Him.</p>
<p>3. But it is greatly to be wondered at, how it has come to pass that, while affirming that
they have found out the mysteries of God, they have not examined the Gospels to ascertain
how often after His baptism the Lord went up, at the time of the passover, to Jerusalem, in
accordance with what was the practice of the Jews from every land, and every year, that they
should assemble at this period in Jerusalem, and there celebrate the feast of the passover.
First of all, after He had made the water wine at Cana of Galilee, He went up to the festival
day of the passover, on which occasion it is written, “For many believed in Him, when they
saw the signs which He did,”478 as John the disciple of the Lord records. Then, again,
withdrawing Himself [from Judæa], He is found in Samaria; on which occasion, too, He
conversed with the Samaritan woman, and while at a distance, cured the son of the centurion
by a word, saying, “Go thy way, thy son liveth.”479 Afterwards He went up, the second
time, to observe the festival day of the passover480 in Jerusalem; on which occasion He cured
the paralytic man, who had lain beside the pool thirty-eight years, bidding him rise, take up
his couch, and depart. Again, withdrawing from thence to the other side of the sea of
Tiberias,481 He there seeing a great crowd had followed Him, fed all that multitude with

John, is one of the most difficult points in New Testament criticism. Some modern scholars think that the feast
of Purim is intended by the Evangelist; but, upon the whole, the current of opinion that has always prevailed in
the Church has been in favour of the statement here made by Irenæus. Christ would therefore be present at four
passovers after His baptism: (1) John ii. 13; (2) John v. 1; (3) John vi. 4; (4) John xiii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">481 John vi. 1, etc.</note>

five loaves of bread, and twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above. Then, when
He had raised Lazarus from the dead, and plots were formed against Him by the Pharisees,
He withdrew to a city called Ephraim; and from that place, as it is written “He came to
Bethany six days before the passover,”482 and going up from Bethany to Jerusalem, He there
ate the passover, and suffered on the day following. Now, that these three occasions of the
passover are not included within one year, every person whatever must acknowledge. And
that the special month in which the passover was celebrated, and in which also the Lord
suffered, was not the twelfth, but the first, those men who boast that they know all things,
if they know not this, may learn it from Moses. Their explanation, therefore, both of the
year and of the twelfth month has been proved false, and they ought to reject either their
explanation or the Gospel; otherwise [this unanswerable question forces itself upon them],
How is it possible that the Lord preached for one year only?</p>
<p>4. Being thirty years old when He came to be baptized, and then possessing the full age
of a Master,483 He came to Jerusalem, so that He might be properly acknowledged484 by all
as a Master. For He did not seem one thing while He was another, as those affirm who describe
Him as being man only in appearance; but what He was, that He also appeared to be.
Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of a Master, not despising or evading
any condition of humanity, nor setting aside in Himself that law which He had485 appointed
for the human race, but sanctifying every age, by that period corresponding to it which belonged
to Himself. For He came to save all through means of Himself—all, I say, who through
Him are born again to God486—infants,487 and children, and boys, and youths, and old
men. He therefore passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus sanctifying
infants; a child for children, thus sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same
time made to them an example of piety, righteousness, and submission; a youth for youths,
becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord. So likewise He was
an old man for old men, that He might be a perfect Master for all, not merely as respects

the setting forth of the truth, but also as regards age, sanctifying at the same time the aged
also, and becoming an example to them likewise. Then, at last, He came on to death itself,
that He might be “the first-born from the dead, that in all things He might have the preeminence,”
488 the Prince of life,489 existing before all, and going before all.490</p>
<p>5. They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is
written, “to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,” maintain that He preached for one
year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus,] they are forgetful to
their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is
both more necessary and more honourable than any other; that more advanced age, I mean,
during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had disciples,
if He did not teach? And how could He have taught, unless He had reached the age of a
Master? For when He came to be baptized, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but
was beginning to be about thirty years of age (for thus Luke, who has mentioned His years,
has expressed it: “Now Jesus was, as it were, beginning to be thirty years old,”491 when He
came to receive baptism); and, [according to these men,] He preached only one year reckoning
from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a
young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age. Now, that the first stage
of early life embraces thirty years,492 and that this extends onwards to the fortieth year,
every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards
old age, which our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the
Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple
of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that information.493 And he remained

the unsatisfactory character of tradition, where a mere fact is concerned. From reasonings founded upon the
evangelical history, as well as from a preponderance of external testimony, it is most certain that our Lord’s
ministry extended but little over three years; yet here Irenæus states that it included more than ten years, and
appeals to a tradition derived, as he says, from those who had conversed with an apostle”</note>

<pb n="1009"/>
among them up to the times of Trajan.494 Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but
the other apostles also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as
to the [validity of] the statement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men
as these, or Ptolemæus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained
to the slightest trace of an apostle?</p>
<p>6. But, besides this, those very Jews who then disputed with the Lord Jesus Christ have
most clearly indicated the same thing. For when the Lord said to them, “Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad,” they answered Him, “Thou art not yet
fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?”495 Now, such language is fittingly applied
to one who has already passed the age of forty, without having as yet reached his fiftieth
year, yet is not far from this latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old it would
unquestionably be said, “Thou art not yet forty years old.” For those who wished to convict
Him of falsehood would certainly not extend the number of His years far beyond the age
which they saw He had attained; but they mentioned a period near His real age, whether
they had truly ascertained this out of the entry in the public register, or simply made a
conjecture from what they observed that He was above forty years old, and that He certainly
was not one of only thirty years of age. For it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that they
were mistaken by twenty years, when they wished to prove Him younger than the times of
Abraham. For what they saw, that they also expressed; and He whom they beheld was not
a mere phantasm, but an actual being496 of flesh and blood. He did not then want much of
being fifty years old;497 and, in accordance with that fact, they said to Him, “Thou art not
yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?” He did not therefore preach only for one
year, nor did He suffer in the twelfth month of the year. For the period included between
the thirtieth and the fiftieth year can never be regarded as one year, unless indeed, among
their Æons, there be so long years assigned to those who sit in their ranks with Bythus in
the Pleroma; of which beings Homer the poet, too, has spoken, doubtless being inspired by
the Mother of their [system of] error:—

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The woman who suffered from an issue of blood was no type
of the suffering Æon.</head>
<p>1. Moreover, their ignorance comes out in a clear light with respect to the case of that
woman who, suffering from an issue of blood, touched the hem of the Lord’s garment, and
so was made whole; for they maintain that through her was shown forth that twelfth power
who suffered passion, and flowed out towards immensity, that is, the twelfth Æon. [This
ignorance of theirs appears] first, because, as I have shown, according to their own system,
that was not the twelfth Æon. But even granting them this point [in the meantime], there
being twelve Æons, eleven of these are said to have continued impassible, while the twelfth
suffered passion; but the woman, on the other hand, being healed in the twelfth year, it is
manifest that she had continued to suffer during eleven years, and was healed in the twelfth.
If indeed they were to say that eleven Æons were involved in passion, but the twelfth one
was healed, it would then be a plausible thing to say that the woman was a type of these. But
since she suffered during eleven years, and [all that time] obtained no cure, but was healed
in the twelfth year, in what way can she be a type of the twelfth of the Æons, eleven of whom,
[according to hypothesis,] did not suffer at all, but the twelfth alone participated in suffering?
For a type and emblem is, no doubt, sometimes diverse from the truth [signified] as to
matter and substance; but it ought, as to the general form and features, to maintain a likeness
[to what is typified], and in this way to shadow forth by means of things present those which
are yet to come.</p>
<p>2. And not only in the case of this woman have the years of her infirmity (which they
affirm to fit in with their figment) been mentioned, but, lo! another woman was also healed,
after suffering in like manner for eighteen years; concerning whom the Lord said, “And
ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound during eighteen years, to be
set free on the Sabbath-day?”500 If, then, the former was a type of the twelfth Æon that
suffered, the latter should also be a type of the eighteenth Æon in suffering. But they cannot
maintain this; otherwise their primary and original Ogdoad will be included in the number
of Æons who suffered together. Moreover, there was also a certain other person501 healed
by the Lord, after he had suffered for eight-and-thirty years: they ought therefore to affirm
that the Æon who occupies the thirty-eighth place suffered. For if they assert that the things
which were done by the Lord were types of what took place in the Pleroma, the type ought
to be preserved throughout. But they can neither adapt to their fictitious system the case of
her who was cured after eighteen years, nor of him who was cured after thirty-eight years.
Now, it is in every way absurd and inconsistent to declare that the Saviour preserved the
<note type="footnote">500 Luke xiii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">501 John v. 5.</note>

<pb n="1012"/>
type in certain cases, while He did not do so in others. The type of the woman, therefore,
[with the issue of blood] is shown to have no analogy to their system of Æons.502</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Folly of the arguments derived by the heretics from numbers,
letters, and syllables.</head>
<p>1. This very thing, too, still further demonstrates their opinion false, and their fictitious
system untenable, that they endeavour to bring forward proofs of it, sometimes through
means of numbers and the syllables of names, sometimes also through the letter of syllables,
and yet again through those numbers which are, according to the practice followed by the
Greeks, contained in [different] letters;—[this, I say,] demonstrates in the clearest manner
their overthrow or confusion,503 as well as the untenable and perverse character of their
[professed] knowledge. For, transferring the name Jesus, which belongs to another language,
to the numeration of the Greeks, they sometimes call it “Episemon,”504 as having six letters,
and at other times “the Plenitude of the Ogdoads,” as containing the number eight hundred
and eighty-eight. But His [corresponding] Greek name, which is “Soter,” that is, Saviour,
because it does not fit in with their system, either with respect to numerical value or as regards
its letters, they pass over in silence. Yet surely, if they regard the names of the Lord, as, in
accordance with the preconceived purpose of the Father, by means of their numerical value
and letters, indicating number in the Pleroma, Soter, as being a Greek name, ought by means
of its letters and the numbers [expressed by these], in virtue of its being Greek, to show forth
the mystery of the Pleroma. But the case is not so, because it is a word of five letters, and its
numerical value is one thousand four hundred and eight.505 But these things do not in any
way correspond with their Pleroma; the account, therefore, which they give of transactions
in the Pleroma cannot be true.</p>
<p>2. Moreover, Jesus, which is a word belonging to the proper tongue of the Hebrews,
contains, as the learned among them declare, two letters and a half,506 and signifies that
Lord who contains heaven and earth;507 for Jesus in the ancient Hebrew language means
“heaven,” while again “earth” is expressed by the words sura usser.508 The word, therefore,
<note type="footnote">503 “Sive confusionem” is very probably a marginal gloss which has found its way into the text. The whole
clause is difficult and obscure.</note>

<note type="footnote">508 Nothing can be made of these words; they have probably been corrupted by ignorant transcribers, and

<pb n="1014"/>
which contains heaven and earth is just Jesus. Their explanation, then, of the Episemon is
false, and their numerical calculation is also manifestly overthrown. For, in their own language,
Soter is a Greek word of five letters; but, on the other hand, in the Hebrew tongue,
Jesus contains only two letters and a half. The total which they reckon up, viz., eight hundred
and eighty-eight, therefore falls to the ground. And throughout, the Hebrew letters do not
correspond in number with the Greek, although these especially, as being the more ancient
and unchanging, ought to uphold the reckoning connected with the names. For these ancient,
original, and generally called sacred letters509 of the Hebrews are ten in number (but they
are written by means of fifteen510), the last letter being joined to the first. And thus they
write some of these letters according to their natural sequence, just as we do, but others in
a reverse direction, from the right hand towards the left, thus tracing the letters backwards.
The name Christ, too, ought to be capable of being reckoned up in harmony with the Æons
of their Pleroma, inasmuch as, according to their statements, He was produced for the establishment
and rectification of their Pleroma. The Father, too, in the same way, ought,
both by means of letters and numerical value, to contain the number of those Æons who
were produced by Him; Bythus, in like manner, and not less Monogenes; but pre-eminently
the name which is above all others, by which God is called, and which in the Hebrew tongue
is expressed by Baruch,511 [a word] which also contains two and a half letters. From this
fact, therefore, that the more important names, both in the Hebrew and Greek languages,
do not conform to their system, either as respects the number of letters or the reckoning
brought out of them, the forced character of their calculations respecting the rest becomes
clearly manifest.</p>
<p>3. For, choosing out of the law whatever things agree with the number adopted in their
system, they thus violently strive to obtain proofs of its validity. But if it was really the purpose
of their Mother, or the Saviour, to set forth, by means of the Demiurge, types of those things
which are in the Pleroma, they should have taken care that the types were found in things
more exactly correspondent and more holy; and, above all, in the case of the Ark of the
Covenant, on account of which the whole tabernacle of witness was formed. Now it was
<note type="footnote">509 “Literæ sacerdotales,”—another enigma which no man can solve. Massuet supposes the reference to be
to the archaic Hebrew characters, still used by the priests after the square Chaldaic letters had been generally
adopted. Harvey thinks that sacerdotales represents the Greek ?e?t???????, “meaning letters as popularly used
in common computation.”</note>

constructed thus: its length512 was two cubits and a half, its breadth one cubit and a half,
its height one cubit and a half; but such a number of cubits in no respect corresponds with
their system, yet by it the type ought to have been, beyond everything else, clearly set forth.
The mercy-seat513 also does in like manner not at all harmonize with their expositions.
Moreover, the table of shew-bread514 was two cubits in length, while its height was a cubit
and a half. These stood before the holy of holies, and yet in them not a single number is of
such an amount as contains an indication of the Tetrad, or the Ogdoad, or of the rest of
their Pleroma. What of the candlestick,515 too, which had seven516 branches and seven
lamps? while, if these had been made according to the type, it ought to have had eight
branches and a like number of lamps, after the type of the primary Ogdoad, which shines
pre-eminently among the Æons, and illuminates the whole Pleroma. They have carefully
enumerated the curtains517 as being ten, declaring these a type of the ten Æons; but they
have forgotten to count the coverings of skin, which were eleven518 in number. Nor, again,
have they measured the size of these very curtains, each curtain519 being eight-and-twenty
cubits in length. And they set forth the length of the pillars as being ten cubits, with a reference
to the Decad of Æons. “But the breadth of each pillar was a cubit and a half;”520 and
this they do not explain, any more than they do the entire number of the pillars or of their
bars, because that does not suit the argument. But what of the anointing oil,521 which
sanctified the whole tabernacle? Perhaps it escaped the notice of the Saviour, or, while their
Mother was sleeping, the Demiurge of himself gave instructions as to its weight; and on this
account it is out of harmony with their Pleroma, consisting,522 as it did, of five hundred
shekels of myrrh, five hundred of cassia, two hundred and fifty of cinnamon, two hundred
and fifty of calamus, and oil in addition, so that it was composed of five ingredients. The
incense523 also, in like manner, [was compounded] of stacte, onycha, galbanum, mint, and
frankincense, all which do in no respect, either as to their mixture or weight, harmonize

with their argument. It is therefore unreasonable and altogether absurd [to maintain] that
the types were not preserved in the sublime and more imposing enactments of the law; but
in other points, when any number coincides with their assertions, to affirm that it was a
type of the things in the Pleroma; while [the truth is, that] every number occurs with the
utmost variety in the Scriptures, so that, should any one desire it, he might form not only
an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad, but any sort of number from the Scriptures, and
then maintain that this was a type of the system of error devised by himself.</p>
<p>4. But that this point is true, that that number which is called five, which agrees in no
respect with their argument, and does not harmonize with their system, nor is suitable for
a typical manifestation of the things in the Pleroma, [yet has a wide prevalence,524] will be
proved as follows from the Scriptures. Soter is a name of five letters; Pater, too, contains
five letters; Agape (love), too, consists of five letters; and our Lord, after525 blessing the five
loaves, fed with them five thousand men. Five virgins526 were called wise by the Lord; and,
in like manner, five were styled foolish. Again, five men are said to have been with the Lord
when He obtained testimony527 from the Father,—namely, Peter, and James, and John, and
Moses, and Elias. The Lord also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead
maiden, and raised her up again; for, says [the Scripture], “He suffered no man to go in,
save Peter and James,528 and the father and mother of the maiden.”529 The rich man in
hell530 declared that he had five brothers, to whom he desired that one rising from the dead
should go. The pool from which the Lord commanded the paralytic man to go into his
house, had five porches. The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities,531 two in
length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed
by the nails. Each of our hands has five fingers; we have also five senses; our internal organs
may also be reckoned as five, viz., the heart, the liver, the lungs, the spleen, and the kidneys.
Moreover, even the whole person may be divided into this number [of parts],—the head,
the breast, the belly, the thighs, and the feet. The human race passes through five ages first
infancy, then boyhood, then youth, then maturity,532 and then old age. Moses delivered the

law to the people in five books. Each table which he received from God contained five533
commandments. The veil covering534 the holy of holies had five pillars. The altar of burntoffering
also was five cubits in breadth.535 Five priests were chosen in the wilderness,—
namely, Aaron,536 Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar, Ithamar. The ephod and the breastplate,
and other sacerdotal vestments, were formed out of five537 materials; for they combined in
themselves gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. And there were five538
kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua the son of Nun shut up in a cave, and directed the
people to trample upon their heads. Any one, in fact, might collect many thousand other
things of the same kind, both with respect to this number and any other he chose to fix
upon, either from the Scriptures, or from the works of nature lying under his observation.539
But although such is the case, we do not therefore affirm that there are five Æons above the
Demiurge; nor do we consecrate the Pentad, as if it were some divine thing; nor do we strive
to establish things that are untenable, nor ravings [such as they indulge in], by means of
that vain kind of labour; nor do we perversely force a creation well adapted by God [for the
ends intended to be served], to change itself into types of things which have no real existence;
nor do we seek to bring forward impious and abominable doctrines, the detection and
overthrow of which are easy to all possessed of intelligence.</p>
<p>5. For who can concede to them that the year has three hundred and sixty-five days
only, in order that there may be twelve months of thirty days each, after the type of the
twelve Æons, when the type is in fact altogether out of harmony [with the antitype]? For,
in the one case, each of the Æons is a thirtieth part of the entire Pleroma, while in the other
they declare that a month is the twelfth part of a year. If, indeed, the year were divided into
thirty parts, and the month into twelve, then a fitting type might be regarded as having been
found for their fictitious system. But, on the contrary, as the case really stands, their Pleroma
is divided into thirty parts, and a portion of it into twelve; while again the whole year is divided
into twelve parts, and a certain portion of it into thirty. The Saviour therefore acted
unwisely in constituting the month a type of the entire Pleroma, but the year a type only of
that Duodecad which exists in the Pleroma; for it was more fitting to divide the year into

thirty parts, even as the whole Pleroma is divided, but the month into twelve, just as the
Æons are in their Pleroma. Moreover, they divide the entire Pleroma into three portions,—
namely, into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. But our year is divided into four
parts, —namely, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And again, not even do the months,
which they maintain to be a type of the Triacontad, consist precisely of thirty days, but some
have more and some less, inasmuch as five days remain to them as an overplus.540 The day,
too, does not always consist precisely of twelve hours, but rises from nine541 to fifteen, and
then falls again from fifteen to nine. It cannot therefore be held that months of thirty days
each were so formed for the sake of [typifying] the Æons; for, in that case, they would have
consisted precisely of thirty days: nor, again, the days of these months, that by means of
twelve hours they might symbolize the twelve Æons; for, in that case, they would always
have consisted precisely of twelve hours.</p>
<p>6. But further, as to their calling material substances “on the left hand,” and maintaining
that those things which are thus on the left hand of necessity fall into corruption, while they
also affirm that the Saviour came to the lost sheep, in order to transfer it to the right hand,
that is, to the ninety and nine sheep which were in safety, and perished not, but continued
within the fold, yet were of the left hand,542 it follows that they must acknowledge that the
enjoyment543 of rest did not imply salvation. And that which has not in like manner the
same number, they will be compelled to acknowledge as belonging to the left hand, that is,
to corruption. This Greek word Agape (love), then, according to the letters of the Greeks,
by means of which reckoning is carried on among them, having a numerical value of ninetythree,
544 is in like manner assigned to the place of rest on the left hand. Aletheia (truth),
too, having in like manner, according to the principle indicated above, a numerical value
of sixty-four,545 exists among material substances. And thus, in fine, they will be compelled
to acknowledge that all those sacred names which do not reach a numerical value of one

<head>Chapter XXV.—God is not to be sought after by means of letters, syllables, and
numbers; necessity of humility in such investigations.</head>
<p>1. If any one, however, say in reply to these things, What then? Is it a meaningless and
accidental thing, that the positions of names, and the election of the apostles, and the
working of the Lord, and the arrangement of created things, are what they are?—we answer
them: Certainly not; but with great wisdom and diligence, all things have clearly been made
by God, fitted and prepared [for their special purposes]; and His word formed both things
ancient and those belonging to the latest times; and men ought not to connect those things
with the number thirty,546 but to harmonize them with what actually exists, or with right
reason. Nor should they seek to prosecute inquiries respecting God by means of numbers,
syllables, and letters. For this is an uncertain mode of proceeding, on account of their varied
and diverse systems, and because every sort of hypothesis may at the present day be, in like
manner, devised547 by any one; so that548 they can derive arguments against the truth from
these very theories, inasmuch as they may be turned in many different directions. But, on
the contrary, they ought to adapt the numbers themselves, and those things which have
been formed, to the true theory lying before them. For system549 does not spring out of
numbers, but numbers from a system; nor does God derive His being from things made,
but things made from God. For all things originate from one and the same God.</p>
<p>2. But since created things are various and numerous, they are indeed well fitted and
adapted to the whole creation; yet, when viewed individually, are mutually opposite and
inharmonious, just as the sound of the lyre, which consists of many and opposite notes,
gives rise to one unbroken melody, through means of the interval which separates each one
from the others. The lover of truth therefore ought not to be deceived by the interval between
each note, nor should he imagine that one was due to one artist and author, and another to
another, nor that one person fitted the treble, another the bass, and yet another the tenor
strings; but he should hold that one and the same person [formed the whole], so as to prove
the judgment, goodness, and skill exhibited in the whole work and [specimen of] wisdom.
Those, too, who listen to the melody, ought to praise and extol the artist, to admire the
tension of some notes, to attend to the softness of others, to catch the sound of others between
both these extremes, and to consider the special character of others, so as to inquire at what

<p>3. If, however, any one do not discover the cause of all those things which become objects
of investigation, let him reflect that man is infinitely inferior to God; that he has received
grace only in part, and is not yet equal or similar to his Maker; and, moreover, that he cannot
have experience or form a conception of all things like God; but in the same proportion as
he who was formed but to-day, and received the beginning of his creation, is inferior to
Him who is uncreated, and who is always the same, in that proportion is he, as respects
knowledge and the faculty of investigating the causes of all things, inferior to Him who
made him. For thou, O man, art not an uncreated being, nor didst thou always co-exist551
with God, as did His own Word; but now, through His pre-eminent goodness, receiving
the beginning of thy creation, thou dost gradually learn from the Word the dispensations
of God who made thee.</p>
<p>4. Preserve therefore the proper order of thy knowledge, and do not, as being ignorant
of things really good, seek to rise above God Himself, for He cannot be surpassed; nor do
thou seek after any one above the Creator, for thou wilt not discover such. For thy Former
cannot be contained within limits; nor, although thou shouldst measure all this [universe],
and pass through all His creation, and consider it in all its depth, and height, and length,
wouldst thou be able to conceive of any other above the Father Himself. For thou wilt not
be able to think Him fully out, but, indulging in trains of reflection opposed to thy nature,
thou wilt prove thyself foolish; and if thou persevere in such a course, thou wilt fall into utter
madness, whilst thou deemest thyself loftier and greater than thy Creator, and imaginest
that thou canst penetrate beyond His dominions.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—“Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.”</head>
<p>1. It is therefore better and more profitable to belong to the simple and unlettered class,
and by means of love to attain to nearness to God, than, by imagining ourselves learned and
skilful, to be found [among those who are] blasphemous against their own God, inasmuch
as they conjure up another God as the Father. And for this reason Paul exclaimed, “Knowledge
puffeth up, but love edifieth:”552 not that he meant to inveigh against a true knowledge
of God, for in that case he would have accused himself; but, because he knew that some,
puffed up by the pretence of knowledge, fall away from the love of God, and imagine that
they themselves are perfect, for this reason that they set forth an imperfect Creator, with
the view of putting an end to the pride which they feel on account of knowledge of this kind,
he says, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.” Now there can be no greater conceit
than this, that any one should imagine he is better and more perfect than He who made and
fashioned him, and imparted to him the breath of life, and commanded this very thing into
existence. It is therefore better, as I have said, that one should have no knowledge whatever
of any one reason why a single thing in creation has been made, but should believe in God,
and continue in His love, than553 that, puffed up through knowledge of this kind, he should
fall away from that love which is the life of man; and that he should search after no other
knowledge except [the knowledge of] Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was crucified for
us, than that by subtle questions and hair-splitting expressions he should fall into impiety.554</p>
<p>2. For how would it be, if any one, gradually elated by attempts of the kind referred to,
should, because the Lord said that “even the hairs of your head are all numbered,”555 set
about inquiring into the number of hairs on each one’s head, and endeavour to search out
the reason on account of which one man has so many, and another so many, since all have
not an equal number, but many thousands upon thousands are to be found with still varying
numbers, on this account that some have larger and others smaller heads, some have bushy
heads of hair, others thin, and others scarcely any hair at all,—and then those who imagine
that they have discovered the number of the hairs, should endeavour to apply that for the
commendation of their own sect which they have conceived? Or again, if any one should,
because of this expression which occurs in the Gospel, “Are not two sparrows sold for a
farthing? and not one of them falls to the ground without the will of your Father,”556 take
occasion to reckon up the number of sparrows caught daily, whether over all the world or

in some particular district, and to make inquiry as to the reason of so many having been
captured yesterday, so many the day before, and so many again on this day, and should then
join on the number of sparrows to his [particular] hypothesis, would he not in that case
mislead himself altogether, and drive into absolute insanity those that agreed with him,
since men are always eager in such matters to be thought to have discovered something
more extraordinary than their masters?557</p>
<p>3. But if any one should ask us whether every number of all the things which have been
made, and which are made, is known to God, and whether every one of these [numbers]
has, according to His providence, received that special amount which it contains; and on
our agreeing that such is the case, and acknowledging that not one of the things which have
been, or are, or shall be made, escapes the knowledge of God, but that through His providence
every one of them has obtained its nature, and rank, and number, and special quantity, and
that nothing whatever either has been or is produced in vain or accidentally, but with exceeding
suitability [to the purpose intended], and in the exercise of transcendent knowledge,
and that it was an admirable and truly divine intellect558 which could both distinguish and
bring forth the proper causes of such a system: if, [I say,] any one, on obtaining our adherence
and consent to this, should proceed to reckon up the sand and pebbles of the earth, yea also
the waves of the sea and the stars of heaven, and should endeavour to think out the causes
of the number which he imagines himself to have discovered, would not his labour be in
vain, and would not such a man be justly declared mad, and destitute of reason, by all possessed
of common sense? And the more he occupied himself beyond others in questions of
this kind, and the more he imagines himself to find out beyond others, styling them unskilful,
ignorant, and animal beings, because they do not enter into his so useless labour, the more
is he [in reality] insane, foolish, struck as it were with a thunderbolt, since indeed he does
in no one point own himself inferior to God; but, by the knowledge which he imagines
himself to have discovered, he changes God Himself, and exalts his own opinion above the
greatness of the Creator.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Proper mode of interpreting parables and obscure passages
of Scripture.</head>
<p>1. A sound mind, and one which does not expose its possessor to danger, and is devoted
to piety and the love of truth, will eagerly meditate upon those things which God has placed
within the power of mankind, and has subjected to our knowledge, and will make advancement
in [acquaintance with] them, rendering the knowledge of them easy to him by means
of daily study. These things are such as fall [plainly] under our observation, and are clearly
and unambiguously in express terms set forth in the Sacred Scriptures. And therefore the
parables ought not to be adapted to ambiguous expressions. For, if this be not done, both
he who explains them will do so without danger, and the parables will receive a like interpretation
from all, and the body559 of truth remains entire, with a harmonious adaptation
of its members, and without any collision [of its several parts]. But to apply expressions
which are not clear or evident to interpretations of the parables, such as every one discovers
for himself as inclination leads him, [is absurd.560] For in this way no one will possess the
rule of truth; but in accordance with the number of persons who explain the parables will
be found the various systems of truth, in mutual opposition to each other, and setting forth
antagonistic doctrines, like the questions current among the Gentile philosophers.</p>
<p>2. According to this course of procedure, therefore, man would always be inquiring but
never finding, because he has rejected the very method of discovery. And when the Bridegroom561
comes, he who has his lamp untrimmed, and not burning with the brightness of
a steady light, is classed among those who obscure the interpretations of the parables, forsaking
Him who by His plain announcements freely imparts gifts to all who come to Him,
and is excluded from His marriage-chamber. Since, therefore, the entire Scriptures, the
prophets, and the Gospels, can be clearly, unambiguously, and harmoniously understood
by all, although all do not believe them; and562 since they proclaim that one only God, to
the exclusion of all others, formed all things by His word, whether visible or invisible,
heavenly or earthly, in the water or under the earth, as I have shown563 from the very words
of Scripture; and since the very system of creation to which we belong testifies, by what falls
under our notice, that one Being made and governs it,—those persons will seem truly foolish
who blind their eyes to such a clear demonstration, and will not behold the light of the announcement
[made to them]; but they put fetters upon themselves, and every one of them

imagines, by means of their obscure interpretations of the parables, that he has found out
a God of his own. For that there is nothing whatever openly, expressly, and without controversy
said in any part of Scripture respecting the Father conceived of by those who hold a
contrary opinion, they themselves testify, when they maintain that the Saviour privately
taught these same things not to all, but to certain only of His disciples who could comprehend
them, and who understood what was intended by Him through means of arguments, enigmas,
and parables. They come, [in fine,] to this, that they maintain there is one Being who is
proclaimed as God, and another as Father, He who is set forth as such through means of
parables and enigmas.</p>
<p>3. But since parables admit of many interpretations, what lover of truth will not acknowledge,
that for them to assert God is to be searched out from these, while they desert what
is certain, indubitable, and true, is the part of men who eagerly throw themselves into danger,
and act as if destitute of reason? And is not such a course of conduct not to build one’s house
upon a rock564 which is firm, strong, and placed in an open position, but upon the shifting
sand? Hence the overthrow of such a building is a matter of ease.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Perfect knowledge cannot be attained in the present life:
many questions must be submissively left in the hands of God.</head>
<p>1. Having therefore the truth itself as our rule and the testimony concerning God set
clearly before us, we ought not, by running after numerous and diverse answers to questions,
to cast away the firm and true knowledge of God. But it is much more suitable that we, directing
our inquiries after this fashion, should exercise ourselves in the investigation of the
mystery and administration of the living God, and should increase in the love of Him who
has done, and still does, so great things for us; but never should fall from the belief by which
it is most clearly proclaimed that this Being alone is truly God and Father, who both formed
this world, fashioned man, and bestowed the faculty of increase on His own creation, and
called him upwards from lesser things to those greater ones which are in His own presence,
just as He brings an infant which has been conceived in the womb into the light of the sun,
and lays up wheat in the barn after He has given it full strength on the stalk. But it is one
and the same Creator who both fashioned the womb and created the sun; and one and the
same Lord who both reared the stalk of corn, increased and multiplied the wheat, and prepared
the barn.</p>
<p>2. If, however, we cannot discover explanations of all those things in Scripture which
are made the subject of investigation, yet let us not on that account seek after any other God
besides Him who really exists. For this is the very greatest impiety. We should leave things
of that nature to God who created us, being most properly assured that the Scriptures are
indeed perfect, since they were spoken by the Word of God and His Spirit; but we, inasmuch
as we are inferior to, and later in existence than, the Word of God and His Spirit, are on
that very account565 destitute of the knowledge of His mysteries. And there is no cause for
wonder if this is the case with us as respects things spiritual and heavenly, and such as require
to be made known to us by revelation, since many even of those things which lie at our very
feet (I mean such as belong to this world, which we handle, and see, and are in close contact
with) transcend our knowledge, so that even these we must leave to God. For it is fitting
that He should excel all [in knowledge]. For how stands the case, for instance, if we endeavour
to explain the cause of the rising of the Nile? We may say a great deal, plausible or otherwise,
on the subject; but what is true, sure, and incontrovertible regarding it, belongs only to God.
Then, again, the dwelling-place of birds—of those, I mean, which come to us in spring, but
fly away again on the approach of autumn—though it is a matter connected with this world,
escapes our knowledge. What explanation, again, can we give of the flow and ebb of the
ocean, although every one admits there must be a certain cause [for these phenomena]? Or
what can we say as to the nature of those things which lie beyond it?566 What, moreover,
<note type="footnote">565 Or, “to that degree.”</note>
<note type="footnote">566 Comp. Clem. Rom. Ep. to Cor., c. xx.; and August, De. Civit Dei, xvi. 9.</note>

<pb n="1027"/>
can we say as to the formation of rain, lightning, thunder, gatherings of clouds, vapours,
the bursting forth of winds, and such like things; or tell as to the storehouses of snow, hail,
and other like things? [What do we know respecting] the conditions requisite for the preparation
of clouds, or what is the real nature of the vapours in the sky? What as to the reason
why the moon waxes and wanes, or what as to the cause of the difference of nature among
various waters, metals, stones, and such like things? On all these points we may indeed say
a great deal while we search into their causes, but God alone who made them can declare
the truth regarding them.</p>
<p>3. If, therefore, even with respect to creation, there are some things [the knowledge of]
which belongs only to God, and others which come within the range of our own knowledge,
what ground is there for complaint, if, in regard to those things which we investigate in the
Scriptures (which are throughout spiritual), we are able by the grace of God to explain some
of them, while we must leave others in the hands of God, and that not only in the present
world, but also in that which is to come, so that God should for ever teach, and man should
for ever learn the things taught him by God? As the apostle has said on this point, that, when
other things have been done away, then these three, “faith, hope, and charity, shall endure.”567
For faith, which has respect to our Master, endures568 unchangeably, assuring us that there
is but one true God, and that we should truly love Him for ever, seeing that He alone is our
Father; while we hope ever to be receiving more and more from God, and to learn from
Him, because He is good, and possesses boundless riches, a kingdom without end, and instruction
that can never be exhausted. If, therefore, according to the rule which I have stated,
we leave some questions in the hands of God, we shall both preserve our faith uninjured,
and shall continue without danger; and all Scripture, which has been given to us by God,
shall be found by us perfectly consistent; and the parables shall harmonize with those passages
which are perfectly plain; and those statements the meaning of which is clear, shall serve to
explain the parables; and through the many diversified utterances [of Scripture] there shall
be heard569 one harmonious melody in us, praising in hymns that God who created all

the substance of things hoped for shall have become a matter of fruition; neither will there be any room for faith,

the passage as Irenæus. They regard the ???? d? of St. Paul as not being temporal, but logical, and conclude

things. If, for instance, any one asks, “What was God doing before He made the world?” we
reply that the answer to such a question lies with God Himself. For that this world was
formed perfect570 by God, receiving a beginning in time, the Scriptures teach us; but no
Scripture reveals to us what God was employed about before this event. The answer therefore
to that question remains with God, and it is not proper571 for us to aim at bringing forward
foolish, rash, and blasphemous suppositions [in reply to it]; so, as by one’s imagining that
he has discovered the origin of matter, he should in reality set aside God Himself who made
all things.</p>
<p>4. For consider, all ye who invent such opinions, since the Father Himself is alone called
God, who has a real existence, but whom ye style the Demiurge; since, moreover, the
Scriptures acknowledge Him alone as God; and yet again, since the Lord confesses Him
alone as His own Father, and knows no other, as I shall show from His very words, —when
ye style this very Being the fruit of defect, and the offspring of ignorance, and describe Him
as being ignorant of those things which are above Him, with the various other allegations
which you make regarding Him,—consider the terrible blasphemy [ye are thus guilty of]
against Him who truly is God. Ye seem to affirm gravely and honestly enough that ye believe
in God; but then, as ye are utterly unable to reveal any other God, ye declare this very Being
in whom ye profess to believe, the fruit of defect and the offspring of ignorance. Now this
blindness and foolish talking flow to you from the fact that ye reserve nothing for God, but
ye wish to proclaim the nativity and production both of God Himself, of His Ennoea, of His
Logos, and Life, and Christ; and ye form the idea of these from no other than a mere human
experience; not understanding, as I said before, that it is possible, in the case of man, who
is a compound being, to speak in this way of the mind of man and the thought of man; and
to say that thought (ennoea) springs from mind (sensus), intention (enthymesis) again from
thought, and word (logos) from intention (but which logos?572 for there is among the Greeks
one logos which is the principle that thinks, and another which is the instrument by means
of which thought is expressed); and [to say] that a man sometimes is at rest and silent, while
at other times he speaks and is active. But since God is573 all mind, all reason, all active
spirit, all light, and always exists one and the same, as it is both beneficial for us to think of
God, and as we learn regarding Him from the Scriptures, such feelings and divisions [of
operation] cannot fittingly be ascribed to Him. For our tongue, as being carnal, is not suffi-

cient to minister to the rapidity of the human mind, inasmuch as that is of a spiritual nature,
for which reason our word is restrained574 within us, and is not at once expressed as it has
been conceived by the mind, but is uttered by successive efforts, just as the tongue is able
to serve it.</p>
<p>5. But God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks exactly what He thinks, and thinks
exactly what He speaks. For His thought is Logos, and Logos is Mind, and Mind comprehending
all things is the Father Himself. He, therefore, who speaks of the mind of God, and
ascribes to it a special origin of its own, declares Him a compound Being, as if God were
one thing, and the original Mind another. So, again, with respect to Logos, when one attributes
to him the third575 place of production from the Father; on which supposition he is
ignorant of His greatness; and thus Logos has been far separated from God. As for the
prophet, he declares respecting Him, “Who shall describe His generation?”576 But ye pretend
to set forth His generation from the Father, and ye transfer the production of the word of
men which takes place by means of a tongue to the Word of God, and thus are righteously
exposed by your own selves as knowing neither things human nor divine.</p>
<p>6. But, beyond reason inflated [with your own wisdom], ye presumptuously maintain
that ye are acquainted with the unspeakable mysteries of God; while even the Lord, the very
Son of God, allowed that the Father alone knows the very day and hour of judgment, when
He plainly declares, “But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but
the Father only.”577 If, then, the Son was not ashamed to ascribe the knowledge of that day
to the Father only, but declared what was true regarding the matter, neither let us be ashamed
to reserve for God those greater questions which may occur to us. For no man is superior
to his master.578 If any one, therefore, says to us, “How then was the Son produced by the
Father?” we reply to him, that no man understands that production, or generation, or calling,
or revelation, or by whatever name one may describe His generation, which is in fact altogether
indescribable. Neither Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor Saturninus, nor Basilides, nor
angels, nor archangels, nor principalities, nor powers [possess this knowledge], but the
Father only who begat, and the Son who was begotten. Since therefore His generation is
unspeakable, those who strive to set forth generations and productions cannot be in their

right mind, inasmuch as they undertake to describe things which are indescribable. For that
a word is uttered at the bidding of thought and mind, all men indeed well understand. Those,
therefore, who have excogitated [the theory of] emissions have not discovered anything
great, or revealed any abstruse mystery, when they have simply transferred what all understand
to the only-begotten Word of God; and while they style Him unspeakable and unnameable,
they nevertheless set forth the production and formation of His first generation, as if
they themselves had assisted at His birth, thus assimilating Him to the word of mankind
formed by emissions.</p>
<p>7. But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same thing also concerning the substance
of matter, that God produced it. For we have learned from the Scriptures that God holds
the supremacy over all things. But whence or in what way He produced it, neither has
Scripture anywhere declared; nor does it become us to conjecture, so as, in accordance with
our own opinions, to form endless conjectures concerning God, but we should leave such
knowledge in the hands of God Himself. In like manner, also, we must leave the cause why,
while all things were made by God, certain of His creatures sinned and revolted from a state
of submission to God, and others, indeed the great majority, persevered, and do still persevere,
in [willing] subjection to Him who formed them, and also of what nature those are
who sinned, and of what nature those who persevere,—[we must, I say, leave the cause of
these things] to God and His Word, to whom alone He said, “Sit at my right hand, until I
make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”579 But as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have
not yet sat down upon His throne. For although the Spirit of the Saviour that is in Him
“searcheth all things, even the deep things of God,”580 yet as to us “there are diversities of
gifts, differences of administrations, and diversities of operations;”581 and we, while upon
the earth, as Paul also declares, “know in part, and prophesy in part.”582 Since, therefore,
we know but in part, we ought to leave all sorts of [difficult] questions in the hands of Him
who in some measure, [and that only,] bestows grace on us. That eternal fire, [for instance,]
is prepared for sinners, both the Lord has plainly declared, and the rest of the Scriptures
demonstrate. And that God foreknew that this would happen, the Scriptures do in like
manner demonstrate, since He prepared eternal fire from the beginning for those who were
[afterwards] to transgress [His commandments]; but the cause itself of the nature of such
transgressors neither has any Scripture informed us, nor has an apostle told us, nor has the
Lord taught us. It becomes us, therefore, to leave the knowledge of this matter to God, even
as the Lord does of the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to such an extreme of

danger, that we will leave nothing in the hands of God, even though we have received only
a measure of grace [from Him in this world]. But when we investigate points which are
above us, and with respect to which we cannot reach satisfaction, [it is absurd583] that we
should display such an extreme of presumption as to lay open God, and things which are
not yet discovered,584 as if already we had found out, by the vain talk about emissions, God
Himself, the Creator of all things, and to assert that He derived His substance from apostasy
and ignorance, so as to frame an impious hypothesis in opposition to God.</p>
<p>8. Moreover, they possess no proof of their system, which has but recently been invented
by them, sometimes resting upon certain numbers, sometimes on syllables, and sometimes,
again, on names; and there are occasions, too, when, by means of those letters which are
contained in letters, by parables not properly interpreted, or by certain [baseless] conjectures,
they strive to establish that fabulous account which they have devised. For if any one should
inquire the reason why the Father, who has fellowship with the Son in all things, has been
declared by the Lord alone to know the hour and the day [of judgment], he will find at
present no more suitable, or becoming, or safe reason than this (since, indeed, the Lord is
the only true Master), that we may learn through Him that the Father is above all things.
For “the Father,” says He, “is greater than I.”585 The Father, therefore, has been declared
by our Lord to excel with respect to knowledge; for this reason, that we, too, as long as we
are connected with the scheme of things in this world, should leave perfect knowledge, and
such questions [as have been mentioned], to God, and should not by any chance, while we
seek to investigate the sublime nature of the Father, fall into the danger of starting the
question whether there is another God above God.586</p>

partial, but a universal, knowledge of all that exists, —being such an one as Valentinus, or
Ptolemæus, or Basilides, or any other of those who maintain that they have searched out
the deep588 things of God,—let him not (arraying himself in vainglory) boast that he has
acquired greater knowledge than others with respect to those things which are invisible, or

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Refutation of the views of the heretics as to the future destiny
of the soul and body.</head>
<p>1. Let us return, however, to the remaining points of their system. For when they declare590
that, at the consummation of all things, their mother shall re-enter the Pleroma,
and receive the Saviour as her consort; that they themselves, as being spiritual, when they
have got rid of their animal souls, and become intellectual spirits, will be the consorts of the
spiritual angels; but that the Demiurge, since they call him animal, will pass into the place
of the Mother; that the souls of the righteous shall psychically repose in the intermediate
place;—when they declare that like will be gathered to like, spiritual things to spiritual, while
material things continue among those that are material, they do in fact contradict themselves,
inasmuch as they no longer maintain that souls pass, on account of their nature, into the
intermediate place to those substances which are similar to themselves, but [that they do
so] on account of the deeds done [in the body], since they affirm that those of the righteous
do pass [into that abode], but those of the impious continue in the fire. For if it is on account
of their nature that all souls attain to the place of enjoyment,591 and all belong to the intermediate
place simply because they are souls, as being thus of the same nature with it, then
it follows that faith is altogether superfluous, as was also the descent592 of the Saviour [to
this world]. If, on the other hand, it is on account of their righteousness [that they attain to
such a place of rest], then it is no longer because they are souls but because they are righteous.
But if souls would have593 perished unless they had been righteous, then righteousness must
have power to save the bodies also [which these souls inhabited]; for why should it not save
them, since they, too, participated in righteousness? For if nature and substance are the
means of salvation, then all souls shall be saved; but if righteousness and faith, why should
these not save those bodies which, equally with the souls, will enter594 into immortality?
For righteousness will appear, in matters of this kind, either impotent or unjust, if indeed
it saves some substances through participating in it, but not others.</p>
<p>2. For it is manifest that those acts which are deemed righteous are performed in bodies.
Either, therefore, all souls will of necessity pass into the intermediate place, and there will

<pb n="1034"/>
never be a judgment; or bodies, too, which have participated in righteousness, will attain to
the place of enjoyment, along with the souls which have in like manner participated, if indeed
righteousness is powerful enough to bring thither those substances which have participated
in it. And then the doctrine concerning the resurrection of bodies which we believe, will
emerge true and certain [from their system]; since, [as we hold,] God, when He resuscitates
our mortal bodies which preserved righteousness, will render them incorruptible and immortal.
For God is superior to nature, and has in Himself the disposition [to show kindness],
because He is good; and the ability to do so, because He is mighty; and the faculty of fully
carrying out His purpose, because He is rich and perfect.</p>
<p>3. But these men are in all points inconsistent with themselves, when they decide that
all souls do not enter into the intermediate place, but those of the righteous only. For they
maintain that, according to nature and substance, three sorts [of being] were produced by
the Mother: the first, which proceeded from perplexity, and weariness, and fear—that is
material substance; the second from impetuosity595—that is animal substance; but that
which she brought forth after the vision of those angels who wait upon Christ, is spiritual
substance. If, then, that substance596 which she brought forth will by all means enter into
the Pleroma because it is spiritual, while that which is material will remain below because
it is material, and shall be totally consumed by the fire which burns within it, why should
not the whole animal substance go into the intermediate place, into which also they send
the Demiurge? But what is it which shall enter within their Pleroma? For they maintain that
souls shall continue in the intermediate place, while bodies, because they possess material
substance, when they have been resolved into matter, shall be consumed by that fire which
exists in it; but their body being thus destroyed, and their soul remaining in the intermediate
place, no part of man will any longer be left to enter in within the Pleroma. For the intellect
of man—his mind, thought, mental intention, and such like—is nothing else than his soul;
but the emotions and operations of the soul itself have no substance apart from the soul.
What part of them, then, will still remain to enter into the Pleroma? For they themselves,
in as far as they are souls, remain in the intermediate place; while, in as far as they are body,
they will be consumed with the rest of matter.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Absurdity of their styling themselves spiritual, while the
Demiurge is declared to be animal.</head>
<p>1. Such being the state of the case, these infatuated men declare that they rise above the
Creator (Demiurge); and, inasmuch as they proclaim themselves superior to that God who
made and adorned the heavens, and the earth, and all things that are in them, and maintain
that they themselves are spiritual, while they are in fact shamefully carnal on account of
their so great impiety,—affirming that He, who has made His angels597 spirits, and is clothed
with light as with a garment, and holds the circle598 of the earth, as it were, in His hand, in
whose sight its inhabitants are counted as grasshoppers, and who is the Creator and Lord
of all spiritual substance, is of an animal nature,—they do beyond doubt and verily betray
their own madness; and, as if truly struck with thunder, even more than those giants who
are spoken of in [heathen] fables, they lift up their opinions against God, inflated by a vain
presumption and unstable glory,—men for whose purgation all the hellebore599 on earth
would not suffice, so that they should get rid of their intense folly.</p>
<p>2. The superior person is to be proved by his deeds. In what way, then, can they show
themselves superior to the Creator (that I too, through the necessity of the argument in
hand, may come down to the level of their impiety, instituting a comparison between God
and foolish men, and, by descending to their argument, may often refute them by their own
doctrines; but in thus acting may God be merciful to me, for I venture on these statements,
not with the view of comparing Him to them, but of convicting and overthrowing their insane
opinions)—they, for whom many foolish persons entertain so great an admiration, as if,
forsooth, they could learn from them something more precious than the truth itself! That
expression of Scripture, “Seek, and ye shall find,”600 they interpret as spoken with this view,
that they should discover themselves to be above the Creator, styling themselves greater
and better than God, and calling themselves spiritual, but the Creator animal; and [affirming]
that for this reason they rise upwards above God, for that they enter in within the Pleroma,
while He remains in the intermediate place. Let them, then, prove themselves by their deeds
superior to the Creator; for the superior person ought to be proved not by what is said, but
by what has a real existence.</p>
<p>3. What work, then, will they point to as having been accomplished through themselves
by the Saviour, or by their Mother, either greater, or more glorious, or more adorned with
wisdom, than those which have been produced by Him who was the disposer of all around
us? What heavens have they established? what earth have they founded? what stars have

they called into existence? or what lights of heaven have they caused to shine? within what
circles, moreover, have they confined them? or, what rains, or frosts, or snows, each suited
to the season, and to every special climate, have they brought upon the earth? And again,
in opposition to these, what heat or dryness have they set over against them? or, what rivers
have they made to flow? what fountains have they brought forth? with what flowers and
trees have they adorned this sublunary world? or, what multitude of animals have they
formed, some rational, and others irrational, but all adorned with beauty? And who can
enumerate one by one all the remaining objects which have been constituted by the power
of God, and are governed by His wisdom? or who can search out the greatness of that God
who made them? And what can be told of those existences which are above heaven, and
which do not pass away, such as Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, and Powers innumerable?
Against what one of these works, then, do they set themselves in opposition?
What have they similar to show, as having been made through themselves, or by themselves,
since even they too are the Workmanship and creatures of this [Creator]? For whether the
Saviour or their Mother (to use their own expressions, proving them false by means of the
very terms they themselves employ) used this Being, as they maintain, to make an image of
those things which are within the Pleroma, and of all those beings which she saw waiting
upon the Saviour, she used him (the Demiurge) as being [in a sense] superior to herself,
and better fitted to accomplish her purpose through his instrumentality; for she would by
no means form the images of such important beings through means of an inferior, but by
a superior, agent.</p>
<p>4. For, [be it observed,] they themselves, according to their own declarations, were then
existing, as a spiritual conception, in consequence of the contemplation of those beings who
were arranged as satellites around Pandora. And they indeed continued useless, the Mother
accomplishing nothing through their instrumentality,601—an idle conception, owing their
being to the Saviour, and fit for nothing, for not a thing appears to have been done by them.
But the God who, according to them, was produced, while, as they argue, inferior to themselves
(for they maintain that he is of an animal nature), was nevertheless the active agent
in all things, efficient, and fit for the work to be done, so that by him the images of all things
were made; and not only were these things which are seen formed by him, but also all things
invisible, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Powers, and Virtues,—[by him, I say,] as being
the superior, and capable of ministering to her desire. But it seems that the Mother made
nothing whatever through their instrumentality, as indeed they themselves acknowledge;
so that one may justly reckon them as having been an abortion produced by the painful
travail of their Mother. For no accoucheurs performed their office upon her, and therefore
they were cast forth as an abortion, useful for nothing, and formed to accomplish no work
<note type="footnote">601 The punctuation is here doubtful. With Massuet and Stieren we expunge “vel” from the text.</note>

<pb n="1037"/>
of the Mother. And yet they describe themselves as being superior to Him by whom so vast
and admirable works have been accomplished and arranged, although by their own reasoning
they are found to be so wretchedly inferior!</p>
<p>5. It is as if there were two iron tools, or instruments, the one of which was continually
in the workman’s hands and in constant use, and by the use of which he made whatever he
pleased, and displayed his art and skill, but the other of which remained idle and useless,
never being called into operation, the workman never appearing to make anything by it,
and making no use of it in any of his labours; and then one should maintain that this useless,
and idle, and unemployed tool was superior in nature and value to that which the artisan
employed in his work, and by means of which he acquired his reputation. Such a man, if
any such were found, would justly be regarded as imbecile, and not in his right mind. And
so should those be judged of who speak of themselves as being spiritual and superior, and
of the Creator as possessed of an animal nature, and maintain that for this reason they will
ascend on high, and penetrate within the Pleroma to their own husbands (for, according to
their own statements, they are themselves feminine), but that God [the Creator] is of an
inferior nature, and therefore remains in the intermediate place, while all the time they bring
forward no proofs of these assertions: for the better man is shown by his works, and all
works have been accomplished by the Creator; but they, having nothing worthy of reason
to point to as having been produced by themselves, are labouring under the greatest and
most incurable madness.</p>
<p>6. If, however, they labour to maintain that, while all material things, such as the heaven,
and the whole world which exists below it, were indeed formed by the Demiurge, yet all
things of a more spiritual nature than these, —those, namely, which are above the heavens,
such as Principalities, Powers, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Virtues,— were produced
by a spiritual process of birth (which they declare themselves to be), then, in the first place,
we prove from the authoritative Scriptures602 that all the things which have been mentioned,
visible and invisible, have been made by one God. For these men are not more to be depended
on than the Scriptures; nor ought we to give up the declarations of the Lord, Moses, and the
rest of the prophets, who have proclaimed the truth, and give credit to them, who do indeed
utter nothing of a sensible nature, but rave about untenable opinions. And, in the next place,
if those things which are above the heavens were really made through their instrumentality,
then let them inform us what is the nature of things invisible, recount the number of the
Angels, and the ranks of the Archangels, reveal the mysteries of the Thrones, and teach us
the differences between the Dominations, Principalities, Powers, and Virtues. But they can
say nothing respecting them; therefore these beings were not made by them. If, on the other
<note type="footnote">602 Or, “the Scriptures of the Lord;” but the words “dominicis scripturis” probably here represent the Greek
?????? ??af??, and are to be rendered as above.</note>

<pb n="1038"/>
hand, these were made by the Creator, as was really the case, and are of a spiritual and holy
character, then it follows that He who produced spiritual beings is not Himself of an animal
nature, and thus their fearful system of blasphemy is overthrown.</p>
<p>7. For that there are spiritual creatures in the heavens, all the Scriptures loudly proclaim;
and Paul expressly testifies that there are spiritual things when he declares that he was caught
up into the third heaven,603 and again, that he was carried away to paradise, and heard unspeakable
words which it is not lawful for a man to utter. But what did that profit him, either
his entrance into paradise or his assumption into the third heaven, since all these things are
still but under the power of the Demiurge, if, as some venture to maintain, he had already
begun604 to be a spectator and a hearer of those mysteries which are affirmed to be above
the Demiurge? For if it is true that he was becoming acquainted with that order of things
which is above the Demiurge, he would by no means have remained in the regions of the
Demiurge, and that so as not even thoroughly to explore even these (for, according to their
manner of speaking, there still lay before him four heavens,605 if he were to approach the
Demiurge, and thus behold the whole seven lying beneath him); but he might have been
admitted, perhaps, into the intermediate place, that is, into the presence of the Mother, that
he might receive instruction from her as to the things within the Pleroma. For that inner
man which was in him, and spoke in him, as they say, though invisible, could have attained
not only to the third heaven, but even as far as the presence of their Mother. For if they
maintain that they themselves, that is, their [inner] man, at once ascends above the Demiurge,
and departs to the Mother, much more must this have occurred to the [inner] man of the
apostle; for the Demiurge would not have hindered him, being, as they assert, himself already
subject to the Saviour. But if he had tried to hinder him, the effort would have gone for
nothing. For it is not possible that he should prove stronger than the providence of the
Father, and that when the inner man is said to be invisible even to the Demiurge. But since
he (Paul) has described that assumption of himself up to the third heaven as something
great and pre-eminent, it cannot be that these men ascend above the seventh heaven, for
they are certainly not superior to the apostle. If they do maintain that they are more excellent
than he, let them prove themselves so by their works, for they have never pretended to
anything like [what he describes as occurring to himself]. And for this reason he added,
“Whether in the body, or whether out of the body, God knoweth,”606 that the body might

<pb n="1039"/>
neither be thought to be a partaker in that vision,607 as if it could have participated in those
things which it had seen and heard; nor, again, that any one should say that he was not
carried higher on account of the weight of the body; but it is therefore thus far permitted
even without the body to behold spiritual mysteries which are the operations of God, who
made the heavens and the earth, and formed man, and placed him in paradise, so that those
should be spectators of them who, like the apostle, have reached a high degree of perfection
in the love of God.</p>
<p>8. This Being, therefore, also made spiritual things, of which, as far as to the third
heaven, the apostle was made a spectator, and heard unspeakable words which it is not
possible for a man to utter, inasmuch as they are spiritual; and He Himself bestows608 [gifts]
on the worthy as inclination prompts Him, for paradise is His; and He is truly the Spirit of
God, and not an animal Demiurge, otherwise He should never have created spiritual things.
But if He really is of an animal nature, then let them inform us by whom spiritual things
were made. They have no proof which they can give that this was done by means of the
travail of their Mother, which they declare themselves to be. For, not to speak of spiritual
things, these men cannot create even a fly, or a gnat, or any other small and insignificant
animal, without observing that law by which from the beginning animals have been and are
naturally produced by God —through the deposition of seed in those that are of the same
species. Nor was anything formed by the Mother alone; [for] they say that this Demiurge
was produced by her, and that he was the Lord (the author) of all creation. And they maintain
that he who is the Creator and Lord of all that has been made is of an animal nature, while
they assert that they themselves are spiritual,—they who are neither the authors nor lords
of any one work, not only of those things which are extraneous to them, but not even of
their own bodies! Moreover, these men, who call themselves spiritual, and superior to the
Creator, do often suffer much bodily pain, sorely against their will.</p>
<p>9. Justly, therefore, do we convict them of having departed far and wide from the truth.
For if the Saviour formed the things which have been made, by means of him (the Demiurge),
he is proved in that case not to be inferior but superior to them, since he is found to have
been the former even of themselves; for they, too, have a place among created things. How,
then, can it be argued that these men indeed are spiritual, but that he by whom they were
<note type="footnote">607 This is an exceedingly obscure and difficult sentence. Grabe and some of the later editors read, “uti neque

the Valentinians, that Paul then witnessed spiritual realities, and by omitting this “non” before “corpus,” makes
Irenæus deny that the body was a partaker in the vision. The point can only be doubtfully decided, but Massuet’s

created is of an animal nature? Or, again, if (which is indeed the only true supposition, as I
have shown by numerous arguments of the very clearest nature) He (the Creator) made all
things freely, and by His own power, and arranged and finished them, and His will is the
substance609 of all things, then He is discovered to be the one only God who created all
things, who alone is Omnipotent, and who is the only Father rounding and forming all
things, visible and invisible, such as may be perceived by our senses and such as cannot,
heavenly and earthly, “by the word of His power;”610 and He has fitted and arranged all
things by His wisdom, while He contains all things, but He Himself can be contained by no
one: He is the Former, He the Builder, He the Discoverer, He the Creator, He the Lord of
all; and there is no one besides Him, or above Him, neither has He any mother, as they
falsely ascribe to Him; nor is there a second God, as Marcion has imagined; nor is there a
Pleroma of thirty Æons, which has been shown a vain supposition; nor is there any such
being as Bythus or Proarche; nor are there a series of heavens; nor is there a virginal light,611
nor an unnameable Æon, nor, in fact, any one of those things which are madly dreamt of
by these, and by all the heretics. But there is one only God, the Creator—He who is above
every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and Virtue: He is Father, He is God, He the
Founder, He the Maker, He the Creator, who made those things by Himself, that is, through
His Word and His Wisdom— heaven and earth, and the seas, and all things that are in them:
He is just; He is good; He it is who formed man, who planted paradise, who made the world,
who gave rise to the flood, who saved Noah; He is the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of the living: He it is whom the law proclaims, whom
the prophets preach, whom Christ reveals, whom the apostles make known612 to us, and in
whom the Church believes. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: through His Word,
who is His Son, through Him He is revealed and manifested to all to whom He is revealed;
for those [only] know Him to whom the Son has revealed Him. But the Son, eternally coexisting
with the Father, from of old, yea, from the beginning, always reveals the Father to
Angels, Archangels, Powers, Virtues, and all to whom He wills that God should be revealed.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Recapitulation and application of the foregoing arguments.</head>
<p>1. Those, then, who are of the school of Valentinus being overthrown, the whole multitude
of heretics are, in fact, also subverted. For all the arguments I have advanced against
their Pleroma, and with respect to those things which are beyond it, showing how the
Father of all is shut up and circumscribed by that which is beyond Him (if, indeed, there be
anything beyond Him), and how there is an absolute necessity [on their theory] to conceive
of many Fathers, and many Pleromas, and many creations of worlds, beginning with one
set and ending with another, as existing on every side; and that all [the beings referred to]
continue in their own domains, and do not curiously intermeddle with others, since, indeed,
no common interest nor any fellowship exists between them; and that there is no other
God of all, but that that name belongs only to the Almighty;—[all these arguments, I say,]
will in like manner apply against those who are of the school of Marcion, and Simon, and
Meander, or whatever others there may be who, like them, cut off that creation with which
we are connected from the Father. The arguments, again, which I have employed against
those who maintain that the Father of all no doubt contains all things, but that the creation
to which we belong was not formed by Him, but by a certain other power, or by angels
having no knowledge of the Propator, who is surrounded as a centre by the immense extent
of the universe, just as a stain is by the [surrounding] cloak; when I showed that it is not a
probable supposition that any other being than the Father of all formed that creation to
which we belong,— these same arguments will apply against the followers of Saturninus,
Basilides, Carpocrates, and the rest of the Gnostics, who express similar opinions. Those
statements, again, which have been made with respect to the emanations, and the Æons,
and the [supposed state of] degeneracy, and the inconstant character of their Mother, equally
overthrow Basilides, and all who are falsely styled Gnostics, who do, in fact, just repeat the
same views under different names, but do, to a greater extent than the former,613 transfer
those things which lie outside614 of the truth to the system of their own doctrine. And the
remarks I have made respecting numbers will also apply against all those who misappropriate
things belonging to the truth for the support of a system of this kind. And all that has been
said respecting the Creator (Demiurge) to show that he alone is God and Father of all, and
whatever remarks may yet be made in the following books, I apply against the heretics at

<p>2. Moreover, those also will be thus confuted who belong to Simon and Carpocrates,
and if there be any others who are said to perform miracles—who do not perform what they
do either through the power of God, or in connection with the truth, nor for the well-being
of men, but for the sake of destroying and misleading mankind, by means of magical deceptions,
and with universal deceit, thus entailing greater harm than good on those who believe
them, with respect to the point on which they lead them astray. For they can neither confer
sight on the blind, nor hearing on the deaf, nor chase away all sorts of demons—[none, indeed,]
except those that are sent into others by themselves, if they can even do so much as
this. Nor can they cure the weak, or the lame, or the paralytic, or those who are distressed
in any other part of the body, as has often been done in regard to bodily infirmity. Nor can
they furnish effective remedies for those external accidents which may occur. And so far
are they from being able to raise the dead, as the Lord raised them, and the apostles did by
means of prayer, and as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of some
necessity—the entire Church in that particular locality entreating [the boon] with much
fasting and prayer, the spirit of the dead man has returned, and he has been bestowed in
answer to the prayers of the saints—that they do not even believe this can be possibly be
done, [and hold] that the resurrection from the dead615 is simply an acquaintance with that
truth which they proclaim.</p>
<p>3. Since, therefore, there exist among them error and misleading influences, and magical
illusions are impiously wrought in the sight of men; but in the Church, sympathy, and
compassion, and stedfastness, and truth, for the aid and encouragement of mankind, are
not only displayed616 without fee or reward, but we ourselves lay out for the benefit of others
our own means; and inasmuch as those who are cured very frequently do not possess the
things which they require, they receive them from us;—[since such is the case,] these men
are in this way undoubtedly proved to be utter aliens from the divine nature, the beneficence
of God, and all spiritual excellence. But they are altogether full of deceit of every kind,
apostate inspiration, demoniacal working, and the phantasms of idolatry, and are in reality
the predecessors of that dragon617 who, by means of a deception of the same kind, will with
his tail cause a third part of the stars to fall from their place, and will cast them down to the
earth. It behoves us to flee from them as we would from him; and the greater the display
with which they are said to perform [their marvels], the more carefully should we watch
them, as having been endowed with a greater spirit of wickedness. If any one will consider

<p>1. Moreover, this impious opinion of theirs with respect to actions—namely, that it is
incumbent on them to have experience of all kinds of deeds, even the most abominable—is
refuted by the teaching of the Lord, with whom not only is the adulterer rejected, but also
the man who desires to commit adultery;618 and not only is the actual murderer held guilty
of having killed another to his own damnation, but the man also who is angry with his
brother without a cause: who commanded [His disciples] not only not to hate men, but also
to love their enemies; and enjoined them not only not to swear falsely, but not even to swear
at all; and not only not to speak evil of their neighbours, but not even to style any one “Raca”
and “fool;” [declaring] that otherwise they were in danger of hell-fire; and not only not to
strike, but even, when themselves struck, to present the other cheek [to those that maltreated
them]; and not only not to refuse to give up the property of others, but even if their own
were taken away, not to demand it back again from those that took it; and not only not to
injure their neighbours, nor to do them any evil, but also, when themselves wickedly dealt
with, to be long-suffering, and to show kindness towards those [that injured them], and to
pray for them, that by means of repentance they might be saved—so that we should in no
respect imitate the arrogance, lust, and pride of others. Since, therefore, He whom these
men boast of as their Master, and of whom they affirm that He had a soul greatly better and
more highly toned than others, did indeed, with much earnestness, command certain things
to be done as being good and excellent, and certain things to be abstained from not only in
their actual perpetration, but even in the thoughts which lead to their performance, as being
wicked, pernicious, and abominable, —how then can they escape being put to confusion,
when they affirm that such a Master was more highly toned [in spirit] and better than others,
and yet manifestly give instruction of a kind utterly opposed to His teaching? And, again,
if there were really no such thing as good and evil, but certain things were deemed righteous,
and certain others unrighteous, in human opinion only, He never would have expressed
Himself thus in His teaching: “The righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father;”619 but He shall send the unrighteous, and those who do not the works of
righteousness, “into everlasting fire, where their worm shall not die, and the fire shall not
be quenched.”620</p>

festation in this life, they may [at once] pass over to the state of perfection, they are, by no
chance, found striving to do those things which wait upon virtue, and are laborious, glorious,
and skilful,622 which also are approved universally as being good. For if it be necessary to
go through every work and every kind of operation, they ought, in the first place, to learn
all the arts: all of them, [I say,] whether referring to theory or practice, whether they be acquired
by self-denial, or are mastered through means of labour, exercise, and perseverance;
as, for example, every kind of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all such as are
occupied with intellectual pursuits: then, again, the whole study of medicine, and the
knowledge of plants, so as to become acquainted with those which are prepared for the
health of man; the art of painting and sculpture, brass and marble work, and the kindred
arts: moreover, [they have to study] every kind of country labour, the veterinary art, pastoral
occupations, the various kinds of skilled labour, which are said to pervade the whole circle
of [human] exertion; those, again, connected with a maritime life, gymnastic exercises,
hunting, military and kingly pursuits, and as many others as may exist, of which, with the
utmost labour, they could not learn the tenth, or even the thousandth part, in the whole
course of their lives. The fact indeed is, that they endeavour to learn none of these, although
they maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind of work; but,
turning aside to voluptuousness, and lust, and abominable actions, they stand self-condemned
when they are tried by their own doctrine. For, since they are destitute of all those [virtues]
which have been mentioned, they will [of necessity] pass into the destruction of fire. These
men, while they boast of Jesus as being their Master, do in fact emulate the philosophy of
Epicurus and the indifference of the Cynics, [calling Jesus their Master,] who not only turned
His disciples away from evil deeds, but even from [wicked] words and thoughts, as I have
already shown.</p>
<p>3. Again, while they assert that they possess souls from the same sphere as Jesus, and
that they are like to Him, sometimes even maintaining that they are superior; while [they
affirm that they were] produced, like Him, for the performance of works tending to the
benefit and establishment of mankind, they are found doing nothing of the same or a like
kind [with His actions], nor what can in any respect be brought into comparison with them.
And if they have in truth accomplished anything [remarkable] by means of magic, they
strive [in this way] deceitfully to lead foolish people astray, since they confer no real benefit
or blessing on those over whom they declare that they exert [supernatural] power; but,
bringing forward mere boys623 [as the subjects on whom they practise], and deceiving their
sight, while they exhibit phantasms that instantly cease, and do not endure even a moment

of time,624 they are proved to be like, not Jesus our Lord, but Simon the magician. It is certain,
625 too, from the fact that the Lord rose from the dead on the third day, and manifested
Himself to His disciples, and was in their sight received up into heaven, that, inasmuch as
these men die, and do not rise again, nor manifest themselves to any, they are proved as
possessing souls in no respect similar to that of Jesus.</p>
<p>4. If, however, they maintain that the Lord, too, performed such works simply in appearance,
we shall refer them to the prophetical writings, and prove from these both that all
things were thus626 predicted regarding Him, and did take place undoubtedly, and that He
is the only Son of God. Wherefore, also, those who are in truth His disciples, receiving grace
from Him, do in His name perform [miracles], so as to promote the welfare of other men,
according to the gift which each one has received from Him. For some do certainly and
truly drive out devils, so that those who have thus been cleansed from evil spirits frequently
both believe [in Christ], and join themselves to the Church. Others have foreknowledge of
things to come: they see visions, and utter prophetic expressions. Others still, heal the sick
by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole. Yea, moreover, as I have said,
the dead even have been raised up, and remained627 among us for many years. And what
shall I more say? It is not possible to name the number of the gifts which the Church,
[scattered] throughout the whole world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of
the Gentiles, neither practising deception upon any, nor taking any reward628 from them
[on account of such miraculous interpositions]. For as she has received freely629 from God,
freely also does she minister [to others].</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Absurdity of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls.</head>
<p>1. We may subvert their doctrine as to transmigration from body to body by this fact,
that souls remember nothing whatever of the events which took place in their previous states
of existence. For if they were sent forth with this object, that they should have experience
of every kind of action, they must of necessity retain a remembrance of those things which
have been previously accomplished, that they might fill up those in which they were still
deficient, and not by always hovering, without intermission, round the same pursuits, spend
their labour wretchedly in vain (for the mere union of a body [with a soul] could not altogether
extinguish the memory and contemplation of those things which had formerly been
experienced633), and especially as they came [into the world] for this very purpose. For as,
when the body is asleep and at rest, whatever things the soul sees by herself, and does in a
vision, recollecting many of these, she also communicates them to the body; and as it happens
that, when one awakes, perhaps after a long time, he relates what he saw in a dream, so also
would he undoubtedly remember those things which he did before he came into this particular
body. For if that which is seen only for a very brief space of time, or has been conceived
of simply in a phantasm, and by the soul alone, through means of a dream, is remembered
after she has mingled again with the body, and been dispersed through all the members,
much more would she remember those things in connection with which she stayed during
so long a time, even throughout the whole period of a bypast life.</p>
<p>2. With reference to these objections, Plato, that ancient Athenian, who also was the
first634 to introduce this opinion, when he could not set them aside, invented the [notion
of] a cup of oblivion, imagining that in this way he would escape this sort of difficulty. He
attempted no kind of proof [of his supposition], but simply replied dogmatically [to the
objection in question], that when souls enter into this life, they are caused to drink of oblivion
by that demon who watches their entrance [into the world], before they effect an entrance
into the bodies [assigned them]. It escaped him, that [by speaking thus] he fell into
another greater perplexity. For if the cup of oblivion, after it has been drunk, can obliterate
the memory of all the deeds that have been done, how, O Plato, dost thou obtain the
knowledge of this fact (since thy soul is now in the body), that, before it entered into the
body, it was made to drink by the demon a drug which caused oblivion? For if thou hast a
remembrance of the demon, and the cup, and the entrance [into life], thou oughtest also to

after the opening period of the chapter.</note>

publicly taught by Pythagoras, who learned it from the Egyptians. Comp. Clem. Alex., Strom., i. 15: Herodot.,

<pb n="1049"/>
be acquainted with other things; but if, on the other hand, thou art ignorant of them, then
there is no truth in the story of the demon, nor in the cup of oblivion prepared with art.</p>
<p>3. In opposition, again, to those who affirm that the body itself is the drug of oblivion,
this observation may be made: How, then, does it come to pass, that whatsoever the soul
sees by her own instrumentality, both in dreams and by reflection or earnest mental exertion,
while the body is passive, she remembers, and reports to her neighbours? But, again, if the
body itself were [the cause of] oblivion, then the soul, as existing in the body, could not remember
even those things which were perceived long ago either by means of the eyes or
the ears; but, as soon as the eye was turned from the things looked at, the memory of them
also would undoubtedly be destroyed. For the soul, as existing in the very [cause of] oblivion,
could have no knowledge of anything else than that only which it saw at the present moment.
How, too, could it become acquainted with divine things, and retain a remembrance of them
while existing in the body, since, as they maintain, the body itself is [the cause of] oblivion?
But the prophets also, when they were upon the earth, remembered likewise, on their returning
to their ordinary state of mind,635 whatever things they spiritually saw or heard in visions
of heavenly objects, and related them to others. The body, therefore, does not cause the soul
to forget those things which have been spiritually witnessed; but the soul teaches the body,
and shares with it the spiritual vision which it has enjoyed.</p>
<p>4. For the body is not possessed of greater power than the soul, since indeed the former
is inspired, and vivified, and increased, and held together by the latter; but the soul possesses636
and rules over the body. It is doubtless retarded in its velocity, just in the exact
proportion in which the body shares in its motion; but it never loses the knowledge which
properly belongs to it. For the body may be compared to an instrument; but the soul is
possessed of the reason of an artist. As, therefore, the artist finds the idea of a work to spring
up rapidly in his mind, but can only carry it out slowly by means of an instrument, owing
to the want of perfect pliability in the matter acted upon, and thus the rapidity of his mental
operation, being blended with the slow action of the instrument, gives rise to a moderate
kind of movement [towards the end contemplated]; so also the soul, by being mixed up with
the body belonging to it, is in a certain measure impeded, its rapidity being blended with
the body’s slowness. Yet it does not lose altogether its own peculiar powers; but while, as it
were, sharing life with the body, it does not itself cease to live. Thus, too, while communicating
other things to the body, it neither loses the knowledge of them, nor the memory of
those things which have been witnessed.</p>

<p>5. If, therefore, the soul remembers nothing637 of what took place in a former state of
existence, but has a perception of those things which are here, it follows that she never existed
in other bodies, nor did things of which she has no knowledge, nor [once] knew things
which she cannot [now mentally] contemplate. But, as each one of us receives his body
through the skilful working of God, so does he also possess his soul. For God is not so poor
or destitute in resources, that He cannot confer its own proper soul on each individual body,
even as He gives it also its special character. And therefore, when the number [fixed upon]
is completed, [that number] which He had predetermined in His own counsel, all those
who have been enrolled for life [eternal] shall rise again, having their own bodies, and having
also their own souls, and their own spirits, in which they had pleased God. Those, on the
other hand, who are worthy of punishment, shall go away into it, they too having their own
souls and their own bodies, in which they stood apart from the grace of God. Both classes
shall then cease from any longer begetting and being begotten, from marrying and being
given in marriage; so that the number of mankind, corresponding to the fore-ordination of
God, being completed, may fully realize the scheme formed by the Father.638</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Souls can be recognised in the separate state, and are immortal
although they once had a beginning.</head>
<p>1. The Lord has taught with very great fulness, that souls not only continue to exist, not
by passing from body to body, but that they preserve the same form639 [in their separate
state] as the body had to which they were adapted, and that they remember the deeds which
they did in this state of existence, and from which they have now ceased,—in that narrative
which is recorded respecting the rich man and that Lazarus who found repose in the bosom
of Abraham. In this account He states640 that Dives knew Lazarus after death, and Abraham
in like manner, and that each one of these persons continued in his own proper position,
and that [Dives] requested Lazarus to be sent to relieve him—[Lazarus], on whom he did
not [formerly] bestow even the crumbs [which fell] from his table. [He tells us] also of the
answer given by Abraham, who was acquainted not only with what respected himself, but
Dives also, and who enjoined those who did not wish to come into that place of torment to
believe Moses and the prophets, and to receive641 the preaching of Him who was642 to rise
again from the dead. By these things, then, it is plainly declared that souls continue to exist,
that they do not pass from body to body, that they possess the form of a man, so that they
may be recognised, and retain the memory of things in this world; moreover, that the gift
of prophecy was possessed by Abraham, and that each class [of souls] receives a habitation
such as it has deserved, even before the judgment.</p>
<p>2. But if any persons at this point maintain that those souls, which only began a little
while ago to exist, cannot endure for any length of time; but that they must, on the one hand,
either be unborn, in order that they may be immortal, or if they have had a beginning in
the way of generation, that they should die with the body itself—let them learn that God
alone, who is Lord of all, is without beginning and without end, being truly and for ever the
same, and always remaining the same unchangeable Being. But all things which proceed
from Him, whatsoever have been made, and are made, do indeed receive their own beginning
of generation, and on this account are inferior to Him who formed them, inasmuch as they
are not unbegotten. Nevertheless they endure, and extend their existence into a long series
of ages in accordance with the will of God their Creator; so that He grants them that they
should be thus formed at the beginning, and that they should so exist afterwards.</p>
<note type="footnote">639 Grabe refers to Tertullian, De Anima, ch. vii., as making a similar statement. Massuet, on the other hand,
denies that Irenæus here expresses an opinion like that of Tertullian in the passage referred to, and thinks that
the special form (character) mentioned is to be understood as simply denoting individual spiritual properties.
But his remarks are not satisfactory.</note>

<p>3. For as the heaven which is above us, the firmament, the sun, the moon, the rest of
the stars, and all their grandeur, although they had no previous existence, were called into
being, and continue throughout a long course of time according to the will of God, so also
any one who thinks thus respecting souls and spirits, and, in fact, respecting all created
things, will not by any means go far astray, inasmuch as all things that have been made had
a beginning when they were formed, but endure as long as God wills that they should have
an existence and continuance. The prophetic Spirit bears testimony to these opinions, when
He declares, “For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created:
He hath established them for ever, yea, forever and ever.”643 And again, He thus speaks respecting
the salvation of man: “He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest him length of days
for ever and ever;”644 indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance for ever
and ever on those who are saved. For life does not arise from us, nor from our own nature;
but it is bestowed according to the grace of God. And therefore he who shall preserve the
life bestowed upon him, and give thanks to Him who imparted it, shall receive also length
of days for ever and ever. But he who shall reject it, and prove himself ungrateful to his
Maker, inasmuch as he has been created, and has not recognised Him who bestowed [the
gift upon him], deprives himself of [the privilege of] continuance for ever and ever.645 And,
for this reason, the Lord declared to those who showed themselves ungrateful towards Him:
“If ye have not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that which is great?”646
indicating that those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves ungrateful to
Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him length of days for ever and ever.</p>
<p>4. But as the animal body is certainly not itself the soul, yet has fellowship with the soul
as long as God pleases; so the soul herself is not life,647 but partakes in that life bestowed
upon her by God. Wherefore also the prophetic word declares of the first-formed man, “He
became a living soul,”648 teaching us that by the participation of life the soul became alive;
so that the soul, and the life which it possesses, must be understood as being separate existences.
When God therefore bestows life and perpetual duration, it comes to pass that even
souls which did not previously exist should henceforth endure [for ever], since God has
both willed that they should exist, and should continue in existence. For the will of God

Chapter XXXV.—Refutation of Basilides, and of the opinion that the prophets
uttered their predictions under the inspiration of different gods.</head>
<p>1. Moreover, in addition to what has been said, Basilides himself will, according to his
own principles, find it necessary to maintain not only that there are three hundred and sixtyfive
heavens made in succession by one another, but that an immense and innumerable
multitude of heavens have always been in the process of being made, and are being made,
and will continue to be made, so that the formation of heavens of this kind can never cease.
For if from the efflux649 of the first heaven the second was made after its likeness, and the
third after the likeness of the second, and so on with all the remaining subsequent ones,
then it follows, as a matter of necessity, that from the efflux of our heaven, which he indeed
terms the last, another be formed like to it, and from that again a third; and thus there can
never cease, either the process of efflux from those heavens which have been already made,
or the manufacture of [new] heavens, but the operation must go on ad infinitum, and give
rise to a number of heavens which will be altogether indefinite.</p>
<p>2. The remainder of those who are falsely termed Gnostics, and who maintain that the
prophets uttered their prophecies under the inspiration of different gods, will be easily
overthrown by this fact, that all the prophets proclaimed one God and Lord, and that the
very Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things which are therein; while they moreover
announced the advent of His Son, as I shall demonstrate from the Scriptures themselves, in
the books which follow.</p>
<p>3. If, however, any object that, in the Hebrew language, diverse expressions [to represent
God] occur in the Scriptures, such as Sabaoth, Eloë, Adonai, and all other such terms,
striving to prove from these that there are different powers and gods, let them learn that all
expressions of this kind are but announcements and appellations of one and the same Being.
For the term Eloë in the Jewish language denotes God, while Elōeim650 and Eleōuth in the
Hebrew language signify “that which contains all.” As to the appellation Adonai, sometimes
it denotes what is nameable651 and admirable; but at other times, when the letter Daleth in
it is doubled, and the word receives an initial652 guttural sound—thus Addonai—[it signifies],
<note type="footnote">649 Ex defluxu, corresponding to ἐξ ἀποῤῥοίας in the Greek.</note>
<note type="footnote">650 Eloæ here occurs in the Latin text, but Harvey supposes that the Greek had been ᾽Ελωείμ. He also remarks
that Eloeuth ( אֱלָהוּת ) is the rabbinical abstract term, Godhead.</note>
<note type="footnote">651 All that can be remarked on this is, that the Jews substituted the term Adonai ( אֲדֹנַי ) for the name Jehovah,
as often as the latter occurred in the sacred text. The former might therefore be styled nameable.</note>
<note type="footnote">652 The Latin text is, “aliquando autem duplicata litera delta cum aspiratione,” and Harvey supposes that the
doubling of the Daleth would give “to the scarcely articulate א a more decidedly guttural character;” but the
sense is extremely doubtful.</note>

<pb n="1055"/>
“One who bounds and separates the land from the water,” so that the water should not
subsequently653 submerge the land. In like manner also, Sabaoth,654 when it is spelled by
a Greek Omega in the last syllable [Sabaōth], denotes “a voluntary agent;” but when it is
spelled with a Greek Omicron —as, for instance, Sabaŏth—it expresses “the first heaven.”
In the same way, too, the word Jaōth,655 when the last syllable is made long and aspirated,
denotes “a predetermined measure;” but when it is written shortly by the Greek letter
Omicron, namely Jaŏth, it signifies “one who puts evils to flight.” All the other expressions
likewise bring out656 the title of one and the same Being; as, for example (in English657),
The Lord of Powers, The Father of all, God Almighty, The Most High, The Creator, The Maker,
and such like. These are not the names and titles of a succession of different beings, but of
one and the same, by means of which the one God and Father is revealed, He who contains
all things, and grants to all the boon of existence.</p>
<p>4. Now, that the preaching of the apostles, the authoritative teaching of the Lord, the
announcements of the prophets, the dictated utterances of the apostles,658 and the ministration
of the law—all of which praise one and the same Being, the God and Father of all, and
not many diverse beings, nor one deriving his substance from different gods or powers, but
[declare] that all things [were formed] by one and the same Father (who nevertheless adapts
[His works] to the natures and tendencies of the materials dealt with), things visible and
invisible, and, in short, all things that have been made [were created] neither by angels, nor
by any other power, but by God alone, the Father—are all in harmony with our statements,
has, I think, been sufficiently proved, while by these weighty arguments it has been shown
that there is but one God, the Maker of all things. But that I may not be thought to avoid
that series of proofs which may be derived from the Scriptures of the Lord (since, indeed,
<note type="footnote">653 Instead of “nec posteaquam insurgere,” Feuardent and Massuet read “ne possit insurgere,” and include
the clause in the definition of Addonai.</note>
<note type="footnote">654 The author is here utterly mistaken, and, notwithstanding Harvey’s earnest claim for him of a knowledge
of Hebrew, seems clearly to betray his ignorance of that language. The term Sabaoth is never written with an
Omicron, either in the LXX. or by the Greek Fathers, but always with an Omega (Σαβαώθ). Although Harvey
remarks in his preface, that “It is hoped the Hebrew attainments of Irenæus will no longer be denied,” there
appears enough, in the etymologies and explanations of Hebrew terms given in this chapter by the venerable
Father, to prevent such a conclusion; and Massuet’s observation on the passage seems not improbable, when
he says, “Sciolus quispiam Irenæo nostro, in Hebraicis haud satis perito, hic fucum ecisse videtur.”</note>

<pb n="1058"/>
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>Thou hast indeed enjoined upon me, my very dear friend, that I should bring to light
the Valentinian doctrines, concealed, as their votaries imagine; that I should exhibit their
diversity, and compose a treatise in refutation of them. I therefore have undertaken—showing
that they spring from Simon, the father of all heretics—to exhibit both their doctrines and
successions, and to set forth arguments against them all. Wherefore, since the conviction
of these men and their exposure is in many points but one work, I have sent unto thee
[certain] books, of which the first comprises the opinions of all these men, and exhibits their
customs, and the character of their behaviour. In the second, again, their perverse teachings
are cast down and overthrown, and, such as they really are, laid bare and open to view. But
in this, the third book I shall adduce proofs from the Scriptures, so that I may come behind
in nothing of what thou hast enjoined; yea, that over and above what thou didst reckon
upon, thou mayest receive from me the means of combating and vanquishing those who,
in whatever manner, are propagating falsehood. For the love of God, being rich and ungrudging,
confers upon the suppliant more than he can ask from it. Call to mind then, the
things which I have stated in the two preceding books, and, taking these in connection with
them, thou shalt have from me a very copious refutation of all the heretics; and faithfully
and strenuously shalt thou resist them in defence of the only true and life-giving faith, which
the Church has received from the apostles and imparted to her sons. For the Lord of all gave
to His apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have known the truth, that
is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also did the Lord declare: “He that heareth you,
heareth Me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me, and Him that sent Me.”660</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The apostles did not commence to preach the Gospel, or to place
anything on record until they were endowed with the gifts and power of the Holy
Spirit. They preached one God alone, Maker of heaven and earth.</head>
<p>1. We have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through
whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in public, and,
at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground
and pillar of our faith.661 For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed
“perfect knowledge,” as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of
the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were invested with power
from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], were filled from all [His gifts],
and had perfect knowledge: they departed to the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings
of the good things [sent] from God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who
indeed do all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a
written Gospel among the Hebrews662 in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were
preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark,
the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been
preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached
by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast,
did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.</p>
<p>2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and earth, an-
nounced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ the Son of God. If any one do not
agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord; nay more, he despises Christ
Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, and stands self-condemned, resisting and
opposing his own salvation, as is the case with all heretics.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The heretics follow neither Scripture nor tradition.</head>
<p>1. When, however, they are confuted from the Scriptures, they turn round and accuse
these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct, nor of authority, and [assert] that they
are ambiguous, and that the truth cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant
of tradition. For [they allege] that the truth was not delivered by means of written documents,
but vivâ voce: wherefore also Paul declared, “But we speak wisdom among those that are
perfect, but not the wisdom of this world.”663 And this wisdom each one of them alleges to
be the fiction of his own inventing, forsooth; so that, according to their idea, the truth
properly resides at one time in Valentinus, at another in Marcion, at another in Cerinthus,
then afterwards in Basilides, or has even been indifferently in any other opponent,664 who
could speak nothing pertaining to salvation. For every one of these men, being altogether
of a perverse disposition, depraving the system of truth, is not ashamed to preach himself.</p>
<p>2. But, again, when we refer them to that tradition which originates from the apostles,
[and] which is preserved by means of the succession of presbyters in the Churches, they
object to tradition, saying that they themselves are wiser not merely than the presbyters,
but even than the apostles, because they have discovered the unadulterated truth. For [they
maintain] that the apostles intermingled the things of the law with the words of the Saviour;
and that not the apostles alone, but even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one time from the
Demiurge, at another from the intermediate place, and yet again from the Pleroma, but that
they themselves, indubitably, unsulliedly, and purely, have knowledge of the hidden mystery:
this is, indeed, to blaspheme their Creator after a most impudent manner! It comes to this,
therefore, that these men do now consent neither to Scripture nor to tradition.</p>
<p>3. Such are the adversaries with whom we have to deal, my very dear friend, endeavouring
like slippery serpents to escape at all points. Wherefore they must be opposed at all points,
if perchance, by cutting off their retreat, we may succeed in turning them back to the truth.
For, though it is not an easy thing for a soul under the influence of error to repent, yet, on
the other hand, it is not altogether impossible to escape from error when the truth is brought
alongside it.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—A refutation of the heretics, from the fact that, in the various
Churches, a perpetual succession of bishops was kept up.</head>
<p>1. It is within the power of all, therefore, in every Church, who may wish to see the truth,
to contemplate clearly the tradition of the apostles manifested throughout the whole world;
and we are in a position to reckon up those who were by the apostles instituted bishops in
the Churches, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these men to our own times; those
who neither taught nor knew of anything like what these [heretics] rave about. For if the
apostles had known hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to “the
perfect” apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to those
to whom they were also committing the Churches themselves. For they were desirous that
these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom also they were leaving
behind as their successors, delivering up their own place of government to these men; which
men, if they discharged their functions honestly, would be a great boon [to the Church],
but if they should fall away, the direst calamity.</p>
<p>2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the
successions of all the Churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner,
whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble
in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the
apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and
organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing
out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions
of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every Church should agree with this Church,
on account of its pre-eminent authority,665 that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as
the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist
everywhere.</p>
<note type="footnote">665 The Latin text of this difficult but important clause is, “Ad hanc enim ecclesiam propter potiorem principalitatem
necesse est omnem convenire ecclesiam.” Both the text and meaning have here given rise to much
discussion. It is impossible to say with certainty of what words in the Greek original “potiorem principalitatem”
may be the translation. We are far from sure that the rendering given above is correct, but we have been unable
to think of anything better. [A most extraordinary confession. It would be hard to find a worse; but take the
following from a candid Roman Catholic, which is better and more literal: “For to this Church, on account of
more potent principality, it is necessary that every Church (that is, those who are on every side faithful) resort;
in which Church ever, by those who are on every side, has been preserved that tradition which is from the apostles.”
(Berington and Kirk, vol. i. p. 252.) Here it is obvious that the faith was kept at Rome, by those who resort there
from all quarters. She was a mirror of the Catholic World, owing here orthodoxy to them; not the Sun, dispensing
her own light to others, but the glass bringing their rays into a focus. See note at end of book iii.] A discussion
of the subject may be seen in chap. xii. of Dr. Wordsworth’s St. Hippolytus and the Church of Rome.</note>

<pb n="1062"/>
<p>3. The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into
the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus, Paul makes mention in the
Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the third place from
the apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This man, as he had seen the blessed apostles,
and had been conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still
echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for
there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles. In the
time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at Corinth,
the Church in Rome despatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them
to peace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from
the apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent, the Maker of heaven and earth, the
Creator of man, who brought on the deluge, and called Abraham, who led the people from
the land of Egypt, spake with Moses, set forth the law, sent the prophets, and who has prepared
fire for the devil and his angels. From this document, whosoever chooses to do so,
may learn that He, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was preached by the Churches, and
may also understand the apostolical tradition of the Church, since this Epistle is of older
date than these men who are now propagating falsehood, and who conjure into existence
another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To this Clement there
succeeded Evaristus. Alexander followed Evaristus; then, sixth from the apostles, Sixtus was
appointed; after him, Telesphorus, who was gloriously martyred; then Hyginus; after him,
Pius; then after him, Anicetus. Soter having succeeded Anicetus, Eleutherius does now, in
the twelfth place from the apostles, hold the inheritance of the episcopate. In this order, and
by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the
truth, have come down to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the
same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the apostles until now,
and handed down in truth.</p>
<p>4. But Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who
had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna,
whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a
very old man, gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom,666 departed this life, having
always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the Church has
handed down, and which alone are true. To these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as
do also those men who have succeeded Polycarp down to the present time,—a man who
was of much greater weight, and a more stedfast witness of truth, than Valentinus, and
Marcion, and the rest of the heretics. He it was who, coming to Rome in the time of Anicetus
<note type="footnote">666 Polycarp suffered about the year 167, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. His great age of eighty-six years
implies that he was contemporary with St. John for nearly twenty years.</note>

<pb n="1063"/>
caused many to turn away from the aforesaid heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming
that he had received this one and sole truth from the apostles,—that, namely, which is
handed down by the Church.667 There are also those who heard from him that John, the
disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed
out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, “Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall
down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within.” And Polycarp himself replied
to Marcion, who met him on one occasion, and said, “Dost thou know me?” “I do know
thee, the first-born of Satan.” Such was the horror which the apostles and their disciples had
against holding even verbal communication with any corrupters of the truth; as Paul also
says, “A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; knowing that
he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.”668 There is also a
very powerful669 Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, from which those who choose
to do so, and are anxious about their salvation, can learn the character of his faith, and the
preaching of the truth. Then, again, the Church in Ephesus, founded by Paul, and having
John remaining among them permanently until the times of Trajan, is a true witness of the
tradition of the apostles.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The truth is to be found nowhere else but in the Catholic Church,
the sole depository of apostolical doctrine. Heresies are of recent formation, and
cannot trace their origin up to the apostles.</head>
<p>1. Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessary to seek the truth among others
which it is easy to obtain from the Church; since the apostles, like a rich man [depositing
his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most copiously all things pertaining to the truth:
so that every man, whosoever will, can draw from her the water of life.670 For she is the
entrance to life; all others are thieves and robbers. On this account are we bound to avoid
them, but to make choice of the thing pertaining to the Church with the utmost diligence,
and to lay hold of the tradition of the truth. For how stands the case? Suppose there arise a
dispute relative to some important question671 among us, should we not have recourse to
the most ancient Churches with which the apostles held constant intercourse, and learn
from them what is certain and clear in regard to the present question? For how should it be
if the apostles themselves had not left us writings? Would it not be necessary, [in that case,]
to follow the course of the tradition which they handed down to those to whom they did
commit the Churches?</p>
<p>2. To which course many nations of those barbarians who believe in Christ do assent,
having salvation written in their hearts by the Spirit, without paper or ink, and, carefully
preserving the ancient tradition,672 believing in one God, the Creator of heaven and earth,
and all things therein, by means of Christ Jesus, the Son of God; who, because of His surpassing
love towards His creation, condescended to be born of the virgin, He Himself
uniting man through Himself to God, and having suffered under Pontius Pilate, and rising
again, and having been received up in splendour, shall come in glory, the Saviour of those
who are saved, and the Judge of those who are judged, and sending into eternal fire those
who transform the truth, and despise His Father and His advent. Those who, in the absence
of written documents,673 have believed this faith, are barbarians, so far as regards our language;
but as regards doctrine, manner, and tenor of life, they are, because of faith, very
wise indeed; and they do please God, ordering their conversation in all righteousness,
chastity, and wisdom. If any one were to preach to these men the inventions of the heretics,
speaking to them in their own language, they would at once stop their ears, and flee as far
off as possible, not enduring even to listen to the blasphemous address. Thus, by means of

<note type="footnote">673 Literally, “without letters;” equivalent to, “without paper and ink,” a few lines previously.</note>

<pb n="1065"/>
that ancient tradition of the apostles, they do not suffer their mind to conceive anything of
the [doctrines suggested by the] portentous language of these teachers, among whom neither
Church nor doctrine has ever been established.</p>
<p>3. For, prior to Valentinus, those who follow Valentinus had no existence; nor did those
from Marcion exist before Marcion; nor, in short, had any of those malignant-minded
people, whom I have above enumerated, any being previous to the initiators and inventors
of their perversity. For Valentinus came to Rome in the time of Hyginus, flourished under
Pius, and remained until Anicetus. Cerdon, too, Marcion’s predecessor, himself arrived in
the time of Hyginus, who was the ninth bishop.674 Coming frequently into the Church, and
making public confession, he thus remained, one time teaching in secret, and then again
making public confession; but at last, having been denounced for corrupt teaching, he was
excommunicated675 from the assembly of the brethren. Marcion, then, succeeding him,
flourished under Anicetus, who held the tenth place of the episcopate. But the rest, who are
called Gnostics, take rise from Menander, Simon’s disciple, as I have shown; and each one
of them appeared to be both the father and the high priest of that doctrine into which he
has been initiated. But all these (the Marcosians) broke out into their apostasy much later,
even during the intermediate period of the Church.</p>
<note type="footnote">674 The old Latin translation says the eighth bishop; but there is no discrepancy. Eusebius, who has preserved
the Greek of this passage, probably counted the apostles as the first step in the episcopal succession. As Irenæus
tells us in the preceding chapter, Linus is to be counted as the first bishop.</note>
<note type="footnote">675 It is thought that this does not mean excommunication properly so called, but a species of self-excommunication,
i.e., anticipating the sentence of the Church, by quitting it altogether. See Valesius’s note in his edition
of Eusebius.</note>

<head>Chapter V.—Christ and His apostles, without any fraud, deception, or hypocrisy,
preached that one God, the Father, was the founder of all things. They did not
accommodate their doctrine to the prepossessions of their hearers.</head>
<p>1. Since, therefore, the tradition from the apostles does thus exist in the Church, and is
permanent among us, let us revert to the Scriptural proof furnished by those apostles who
did also write the Gospel, in which they recorded the doctrine regarding God, pointing out
that our Lord Jesus Christ is the truth,676 and that no lie is in Him. As also David says,
prophesying His birth from a virgin, and the resurrection from the dead, “Truth has sprung
out of the earth.”677 The apostles, likewise, being disciples of the truth, are above all falsehood;
for a lie has no fellowship with the truth, just as darkness has none with light, but the presence
of the one shuts out that of the other. Our Lord, therefore, being the truth, did not speak
lies; and whom He knew to have taken origin from a defect, He never would have acknowledged
as God, even the God of all, the Supreme King, too, and His own Father, an imperfect
being as a perfect one, an animal one as a spiritual, Him who was without the Pleroma as
Him who was within it. Neither did His disciples make mention of any other God, or term
any other Lord, except Him, who was truly the God and Lord of all, as these most vain
sophists affirm that the apostles did with hypocrisy frame their doctrine according to the
capacity of their hearers, and gave answers after the opinions of their questioners,—fabling
blind things for the blind, according to their blindness; for the dull according to their dulness;
for those in error according to their error. And to those who imagined that the Demiurge
alone was God, they preached him; but to those who are capable of comprehending the
unnameable Father, they did declare the unspeakable mystery through parables and enigmas:
so that the Lord and the apostles exercised the office of teacher not to further the cause of
truth, but even in hypocrisy, and as each individual was able to receive it!</p>
<p>2. Such [a line of conduct] belongs not to those who heal, or who give life: it is rather
that of those bringing on diseases, and increasing ignorance; and much more true than these
men shall the law be found, which pronounces every one accursed who sends the blind man
astray in the way. For the apostles, who were commissioned to find out the wanderers, and
to be for sight to those who saw not, and medicine to the weak, certainly did not address
them in accordance with their opinion at the time, but according to revealed truth. For no
persons of any kind would act properly, if they should advise blind men, just about to fall
over a precipice, to continue their most dangerous path, as if it were the right one, and as
if they might go on in safety. Or what medical man, anxious to heal a sick person, would
prescribe in accordance with the patient’s whims, and not according to the requisite medicine?
But that the Lord came as the physician of the sick, He does Himself declare saying,
<note type="footnote">676 John xiv. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">677 Ps. lxxxv. 11.</note>

<pb n="1067"/>
“They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.”678 How then shall the sick be strengthened, or how
shall sinners come to repentance? Is it by persevering in the very same courses? or, on the
contrary, is it by undergoing a great change and reversal of their former mode of living, by
which they have brought upon themselves no slight amount of sickness, and many sins?
But ignorance, the mother of all these, is driven out by knowledge. Wherefore the Lord used
to impart knowledge to His disciples, by which also it was His practice to heal those who
were suffering, and to keep back sinners from sin. He therefore did not address them in
accordance with their pristine notions, nor did He reply to them in harmony with the
opinion of His questioners, but according to the doctrine leading to salvation, without hypocrisy
or respect of person.</p>
<p>3. This is also made clear from the words of the Lord, who did truly reveal the Son of
God to those of the circumcision— Him who had been foretold as Christ by the prophets;
that is, He set Himself forth, who had restored liberty to men, and bestowed on them the
inheritance of incorruption. And again, the apostles taught the Gentiles that they should
leave vain stocks and stones, which they imagined to be gods, and worship the true God,
who had created and made all the human family, and, by means of His creation, did nourish,
increase, strengthen, and preserve them in being; and that they might look for His Son Jesus
Christ, who redeemed us from apostasy with His own blood, so that we should also be a
sanctified people,—who shall also descend from heaven in His Father’s power, and pass
judgment upon all, and who shall freely give the good things of God to those who shall have
kept His commandments. He, appearing in these last times, the chief cornerstone, has
gathered into one, and united those that were far off and those that were near;679 that is,
the circumcision and the uncircumcision, enlarging Japhet, and placing him in the dwelling
of Shem.680</p>

<head>Chapter VI—The Holy Ghost, throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, made
mention of no other God or Lord, save him who is the true God.</head>
<p>1. Therefore neither would the Lord, nor the Holy Spirit, nor the apostles, have ever
named as God, definitely and absolutely, him who was not God, unless he were truly God;
nor would they have named any one in his own person Lord, except God the Father ruling
over all, and His Son who has received dominion from His Father over all creation, as this
passage has it: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool.”681 Here the [Scripture] represents to us the Father addressing the
Son; He who gave Him the inheritance of the heathen, and subjected to Him all His enemies.
Since, therefore, the Father is truly Lord, and the Son truly Lord, the Holy Spirit has fitly
designated them by the title of Lord. And again, referring to the destruction of the Sodomites,
the Scripture says, “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah fire and brimstone
from the Lord out of heaven.”682 For it here points out that the Son, who had also
been talking with Abraham, had received power to judge the Sodomites for their wickedness.
And this [text following] does declare the same truth: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
iniquity: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee.”683 For the Spirit designates both
[of them] by the name, of God—both Him who is anointed as Son, and Him who does
anoint, that is, the Father. And again: “God stood in the congregation of the gods, He judges
among the gods.”684 He [here] refers to the Father and the Son, and those who have received
the adoption; but these are the Church. For she is the synagogue of God, which God—that
is, the Son Himself—has gathered by Himself. Of whom He again speaks: “The God of gods,
the Lord hath spoken, and hath called the earth.”685 Who is meant by God? He of whom
He has said, “God shall come openly, our God, and shall not keep silence;”686 that is, the
Son, who came manifested to men who said, “I have openly appeared to those who seek Me
not.”687 But of what gods [does he speak]? [Of those] to whom He says, “I have said, Ye are
gods, and all sons of the Most High.”688 To those, no doubt, who have received the grace
of the “adoption, by which we cry, Abba Father.”689</p>

<p>2. Wherefore, as I have already stated, no other is named as God, or is called Lord, except
Him who is God and Lord of all, who also said to Moses, “I am that I am. And thus shalt
thou say to the children of Israel: He who is, hath sent me unto you;”690 and His Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, who makes those that believe in His name the sons of God. And again,
when the Son speaks to Moses, He says, “I am come down to deliver this people.”691 For it
is He who descended and ascended for the salvation of men. Therefore God has been declared
through the Son, who is in the Father, and has the Father in Himself —He who is, the
Father bearing witness to the Son, and the Son announcing the Father.—As also Esaias says,
“I too am witness,” he declares, “saith the Lord God, and the Son whom I have chosen, that
ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am.”692</p>
<p>3. When, however, the Scripture terms them [gods] which are no gods, it does not, as
I have already remarked, declare them as gods in every sense, but with a certain addition
and signification, by which they are shown to be no gods at all. As with David: “The gods
of the heathen are idols of demons;”693 and, “Ye shall not follow other gods.”694 For in that
he says “the gods of the heathen”—but the heathen are ignorant of the true God—and calls
them “other gods,” he bars their claim [to be looked upon] as gods at all. But as to what they
are in their own person, he speaks concerning them; “for they are,” he says, “the idols of
demons.” And Esaias: “Let them be confounded, all who blaspheme God, and carve useless
things;695 even I am witness, saith God.”696 He removes them from [the category of] gods,
but he makes use of the word alone, for this [purpose], that we may know of whom he
speaks. Jeremiah also says the same: “The gods that have not made the heavens and earth,
let them perish from the earth which is under the heaven.”697 For, from the fact of his having
subjoined their destruction, he shows them to be no gods at all. Elias, too, when all Israel
was assembled at Mount Carmel, wishing to turn them from idolatry, says to them, “How
long halt ye between two opinions?698 If the Lord be God,699 follow Him.”700 And again,

<pb n="1070"/>
at the burnt-offering, he thus addresses the idolatrous priests: “Ye shall call upon the name
of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God; and the Lord that will hearken
by fire,701 He is God.” Now, from the fact of the prophet having said these words, he proves
that these gods which were reputed so among those men, are no gods at all. He directed
them to that God upon whom he believed, and who was truly God; whom invoking, he exclaimed,
“Lord God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, hear me to-day, and let
all this people know that Thou art the God of Israel.”702</p>
<p>4. Wherefore I do also call upon thee, Lord God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and
God of Jacob and Israel, who art the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God who, through
the abundance of Thy mercy, hast had a favour towards us, that we should know Thee, who
hast made heaven and earth, who rulest over all, who art the only and the true God, above
whom there is none other God; grant, by our Lord Jesus Christ, the governing power of the
Holy Spirit; give to every reader of this book to know Thee, that Thou art God alone, to be
strengthened in Thee, and to avoid every heretical, and godless, and impious doctrine.</p>
<p>5. And the Apostle Paul also, saying, “For though ye have served them which are no
gods; ye now know God, or rather, are known of God,”703 has made a separation between
those that were not [gods] and Him who is God. And again, speaking of Antichrist, he says,
“who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.”704
He points out here those who are called gods, by such as know not God, that is, idols. For
the Father of all is called God, and is so; and Antichrist shall be lifted up, not above Him,
but above those which are indeed called gods, but are not. And Paul himself says that this
is true: “We know that an idol is nothing, and that there is none other God but one. For
though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth; yet to us there is but
one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we through Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom are all things, and we by Him.”705 For he has made a distinction, and separated
those which are indeed called gods, but which are none, from the one God the Father, from
whom are all things, and, he has confessed in the most decided manner in his own person,
one Lord Jesus Christ. But in this [clause], “whether in heaven or in earth,” he does not
speak of the formers of the world, as these [teachers] expound it; but his meaning is similar
to that of Moses, when it is said, “Thou shalt not make to thyself any image for God, of
whatsoever things are in heaven above, whatsoever in the earth beneath, and whatsoever in
the waters under the earth.”706 And he does thus explain what are meant by the things in

heaven: “Lest when,” he says, “looking towards heaven, and observing the sun, and the
moon, and the stars, and all the ornament of heaven, falling into error, thou shouldest adore
and serve them.”707 And Moses himself, being a man of God, was indeed given as a god
before Pharaoh;708 but he is not properly termed Lord, nor is called God by the prophets,
but is spoken of by the Spirit as “Moses, the faithful minister and servant of God,”709 which
also he was.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Reply to an objection founded on the words of St. Paul (2 Cor.
iv. 4). St. Paul occasionally uses words not in their grammatical sequence.</head>
<p>1. As to their affirming that Paul said plainly in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians,
“In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not,”710 and
maintaining that there is indeed one god of this world, but another who is beyond all principality,
and beginning, and power, we are not to blame if they, who give out that they do
themselves know mysteries beyond God, know not how to read Paul. For if any one read
the passage thus—according to Paul’s custom, as I show elsewhere, and by many examples,
that he uses transposition of words—“In whom God,” then pointing it off, and making a
slight interval, and at the same time read also the rest [of the sentence] in one [clause], “hath
blinded the minds of them of this world that believe not,” he shall find out the true [sense];
that it is contained in the expression, “God hath blinded the minds of the unbelievers of
this world.” And this is shown by means of the little interval [between the clause]. For Paul
does not say, “the God of this world,” as if recognising any other beyond Him; but he confessed
God as indeed God. And he says, “the unbelievers of this world,” because they shall
not inherit the future age of incorruption. I shall show from Paul himself, how it is that God
has blinded the minds of them that believe not, in the course of this work, that we may not
just at present distract our mind from the matter in hand, [by wandering] at large.</p>
<p>2. From many other instances also, we may discover that the apostle frequently uses a
transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his discourses, and the impetus of
the Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in the [Epistle] to the Galatians, where he
expresses himself as follows: “Wherefore then the law of works?711 It was added, until the
seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the
hand of a Mediator.”712 For the order of the words runs thus: “Wherefore then the law of
works? Ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator, it was added until the seed should
come to whom the promise was made,”— man thus asking the question, and the Spirit
making answer. And again, in the Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, he
says, “And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus Christ713 shall slay with
the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him714 with the presence of his coming; [even
him] whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders.”
715 Now in these [sentences] the order of the words is this: “And then shall be revealed

that wicked, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying
wonders, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy
with the presence of His coming.” For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after
the working of Satan; but the coming of the wicked one, whom we also call Antichrist. If,
then, one does not attend to the [proper] reading [of the passage], and if he do not exhibit
the intervals of breathing as they occur, there shall be not only incongruities, but also, when
reading, he will utter blasphemy, as if the advent of the Lord could take place according to
the working of Satan. So therefore, in such passages, the hyperbaton must be exhibited by
the reading, and the apostle’s meaning following on, preserved; and thus we do not read in
that passage, “the god of this world,” but, “God,” whom we do truly call God; and we hear
[it declared of] the unbelieving and the blinded of this world, that they shall not inherit the
world of life which is to come.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Answer to an objection, arising from the words of Christ (Matt.
vi. 24). God alone is to be really called God and Lord, for He is without beginning
and end.</head>
<p>1. This calumny, then, of these men, having been quashed, it is clearly proved that
neither the prophets nor the apostles did ever name another God, or call [him] Lord, except
the true and only God. Much more [would this be the case with regard to] the Lord Himself,
who did also direct us to “render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the
things that are God’s;”716 naming indeed Cæsar as Cæsar, but confessing God as God. In
like manner also, that [text] which says, “Ye cannot serve two masters,”717 He does Himself
interpret, saying, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon;” acknowledging God indeed as God,
but mentioning mammon, a thing having also an existence. He does not call mammon Lord
when He says, “Ye cannot serve two masters;” but He teaches His disciples who serve God,
not to be subject to mammon, nor to be ruled by it. For He says, “He that committeth sin
is the slave of sin.”718 Inasmuch, then, as He terms those “the slaves of sin” who serve sin,
but does not certainly call sin itself God, thus also He terms those who serve mammon “the
slaves of mammon,” not calling mammon God. For mammon is, according to the Jewish
language, which the Samaritans do also use, a covetous man, and one who wishes to have
more than he ought to have. But according to the Hebrew, it is by the addition of a syllable
(adjunctive) called Mamuel,719 and signifies gulosum, that is, one whose gullet is insatiable.
Therefore, according to both these things which are indicated, we cannot serve God and
mammon.</p>
<p>2. But also, when He spoke of the devil as strong, not absolutely so, but as in comparison
with us, the Lord showed Himself under every aspect and truly to be the strong man, saying
that one can in no other way “spoil the goods of a strong man, if he do not first bind the
strong man himself, and then he will spoil his house.”720 Now we were the vessels and the
house of this [strong man] when we were in a state of apostasy; for he put us to whatever
use he pleased, and the unclean spirit dwelt within us. For he was not strong, as opposed to
Him who bound him, and spoiled his house; but as against those persons who were his tools,
inasmuch as he caused their thought to wander away from God: these did the Lord snatch
from his grasp. As also Jeremiah declares, “The Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and has snatched

him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.”721 If, then, he had not pointed out
Him who binds and spoils his goods, but had merely spoken of him as being strong, the
strong man should have been unconquered. But he also subjoined Him who obtains and
retains possession; for he holds who binds, but he is held who is bound. And this he did
without any comparison, so that, apostate slave as he was, he might not be compared to the
Lord: for not he alone, but not one of created and subject things, shall ever be compared to
the Word of God, by whom all things were made, who is our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>3. For that all things, whether Angels, or Archangels, or Thrones, or Dominions, were
both established and created by Him who is God over all, through His Word, John has thus
pointed out. For when he had spoken of the Word of God as having been in the Father, he
added, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.”722 David
also, when he had enumerated [His] praises, subjoins by name all things whatsoever I have
mentioned, both the heavens and all the powers therein: “For He commanded, and they
were created; He spake, and they were made.” Whom, therefore, did He command? The
Word, no doubt, “by whom,” he says, “the heavens were established, and all their power by
the breath of His mouth.”723 But that He did Himself make all things freely, and as He
pleased, again David says, “But our God is in the heavens above, and in the earth; He hath
made all things whatsoever He pleased.”724 But the things established are distinct from Him
who has established them, and what have been made from Him who has made them. For
He is Himself uncreated, both without beginning and end, and lacking nothing. He is
Himself sufficient for Himself; and still further, He grants to all others this very thing, existence;
but the things which have been made by Him have received a beginning. But whatever
things had a beginning, and are liable to dissolution, and are subject to and stand in need
of Him who made them, must necessarily in all respects have a different term [applied to
them], even by those who have but a moderate capacity for discerning such things; so that
He indeed who made all things can alone, together with His Word, properly be termed God
and Lord: but the things which have been made cannot have this term applied to them,
neither should they justly assume that appellation which belongs to the Creator.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—One and the same God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is He
whom the prophets foretold, and who was declared by the Gospel. Proof of this,
at the outset, from St. Matthew’s Gospel.</head>
<p>1. This, therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it shall yet be so still
more clearly), that neither the prophets, nor the apostles, nor the Lord Christ in His own
person, did acknowledge any other Lord or God, but the God and Lord supreme: the
prophets and the apostles confessing the Father and the Son; but naming no other as God,
and confessing no other as Lord: and the Lord Himself handing down to His disciples, that
He, the Father, is the only God and Lord, who alone is God and ruler of all; —it is incumbent
on us to follow, if we are their disciples indeed, their testimonies to this effect. For Matthew
the apostle— knowing, as one and the same God, Him who had given promise to Abraham,
that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven,725 and Him who, by His Son Christ Jesus,
has called us to the knowledge of Himself, from the worship of stones, so that those who
were not a people were made a people, and she beloved who was not beloved726—declares
that John, when preparing the way for Christ, said to those who were boasting of their relationship
[to Abraham] according to the flesh, but who had their mind tinged and stuffed
with all manner of evil, preaching that repentance which should call them back from their
evil doings, said, “O generation of vipers, who hath shown you to flee from the wrath to
come? Bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves,
We have Abraham [to our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to
raise up children unto Abraham.”727 He preached to them, therefore, the repentance from
wickedness, but he did not declare to them another God, besides Him who made the
promise to Abraham; he, the forerunner of Christ, of whom Matthew again says, and Luke
likewise, “For this is he that was spoken of from the Lord by the prophet, The voice of one
crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill brought low; and the crooked shall
be made straight, and the rough into smooth ways; and all flesh shall see the salvation of
God.”728 There is therefore one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, who also promised,
through the prophets, that He would send His forerunner; and His salvation—that is, His
Word —He caused to be made visible to all flesh, [the Word] Himself being made incarnate,
that in all things their King might become manifest. For it is necessary that those [beings]
which are judged do see the judge, and know Him from whom they receive judgment; and

it is also proper, that those which follow on to glory should know Him who bestows upon
them the gift of glory.</p>
<p>2. Then again Matthew, when speaking of the angel, says, “The angel of the Lord appeared
to Joseph in sleep.”729 Of what Lord he does himself interpret: “That it may be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called my son.”730 “Behold,
a virgin shall conceive, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel;
which is, being interpreted, God with us.”731 David likewise speaks of Him who, from the
virgin, is Emmanuel: “Turn not away the face of Thine anointed. The Lord hath sworn a
truth to David, and will not turn from him. Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy
seat.”732 And again: “In Judea is God known; His place has been made in peace, and His
dwelling in Zion.”733 Therefore there is one and the same God, who was proclaimed by the
prophets and announced by the Gospel; and His Son, who was of the fruit of David’s body,
that is, of the virgin of [the house of] David, and Emmanuel; whose star also Balaam thus
prophesied: “There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a leader shall rise in Israel.”734 But
Matthew says that the Magi, coming from the east, exclaimed “For we have seen His star in
the east, and are come to worship Him;”735 and that, having been led by the star into the
house of Jacob to Emmanuel, they showed, by these gifts which they offered, who it was
that was worshipped; myrrh, because it was He who should die and be buried for the mortal
human race; gold, because He was a King, “of whose kingdom is no end;”736 and frankincense,
because He was God, who also “was made known in Judea,”737 and was “declared to those
who sought Him not.”738</p>
<p>3. And then, [speaking of His] baptism, Matthew says, “The heavens were opened, and
He saw the Spirit of God, as a dove, coming upon Him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”739 For Christ did not at that time
descend upon Jesus, neither was Christ one and Jesus another: but the Word of God—who
is the Saviour of all, and the ruler of heaven and earth, who is Jesus, as I have already pointed

out, who did also take upon Him flesh, and was anointed by the Spirit from the Father—was
made Jesus Christ, as Esaias also says, “There shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse,
and a flower shall rise from his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him: the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and
piety, and the spirit of the fear of God, shall fill Him. He shall not judge according to glory,740
nor reprove after the manner of speech; but He shall dispense judgment to the humble man,
and reprove the haughty ones of the earth.”741 And again Esaias, pointing out beforehand
His unction, and the reason why he was anointed, does himself say, “The Spirit of God is
upon Me, because He hath anointed Me: He hath sent Me to preach the Gospel to the lowly,
to heal the broken up in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind; to
announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance; to comfort all that
mourn.”742 For inasmuch as the Word of God was man from the root of Jesse, and son of
Abraham, in this respect did the Spirit of God rest upon Him, and anoint Him to preach
the Gospel to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was God, He did not judge according to glory,
nor reprove after the manner of speech. For “He needed not that any should testify to Him
of man,743 for He Himself knew what was in man.”744 For He called all men that mourn;
and granting forgiveness to those who had been led into captivity by their sins, He loosed
them from their chains, of whom Solomon says, “Every one shall be holden with the cords
of his own sins.”745 Therefore did the Spirit of God descend upon Him, [the Spirit] of Him
who had promised by the prophets that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from
the abundance of His unction, might be saved. Such, then, [is the witness] of Matthew.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Proofs of the foregoing, drawn from the Gospels of Mark and Luke.</head>
<p>1. Luke also, the follower and disciple of the apostles, referring to Zacharias and Elisabeth,
from whom, according to promise, John was born, says: “And they were both righteous
before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”746
And again, speaking of Zacharias: “And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s
office before God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest’s office,
his lot was to burn incense;”747 and he came to sacrifice, “entering into the temple of the
Lord.”748 Whose angel Gabriel, also, who stands prominently in the presence of the Lord,
simply, absolutely, and decidedly confessed in his own person as God and Lord, Him who
had chosen Jerusalem, and had instituted the sacerdotal office. For he knew of none other
above Him; since, if he had been in possession of the knowledge of any other more perfect
God and Lord besides Him, he surely would never—as I have already shown —have confessed
Him, whom he knew to be the fruit of a defect, as absolutely and altogether God and Lord.
And then, speaking of John, he thus says: “For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and
many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before
Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”749 For
whom, then, did he prepare the people, and in the sight of what Lord was he made great?
Truly of Him who said that John had something even “more than a prophet,”750 and that
“among those born of women none is greater than John the Baptist;” who did also make
the people ready for the Lord’s advent, warning his fellow-servants, and preaching to them
repentance, that they might receive remission from the Lord when He should be present,
having been converted to Him, from whom they had been alienated because of sins and
transgressions. As also David says, “The alienated are sinners from the womb: they go astray
as soon as they are born.”751 And it was on account of this that he, turning them to their
Lord, prepared, in the spirit and power of Elias, a perfect people for the Lord.</p>
<p>2. And again, speaking in reference to the angel, he says: “But at that time the angel
Gabriel was sent from God, who did also say to the virgin, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast
found favour with God.”752 And he says concerning the Lord: “He shall be great, and shall
be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His

father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom there
shall be no end.”753 For who else is there who can reign uninterruptedly over the house of
Jacob for ever, except Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Most High God, who promised
by the law and the prophets that He would make His salvation visible to all flesh; so that He
would become the Son of man for this purpose, that man also might become the son of
God? And Mary, exulting because of this, cried out, prophesying on behalf of the Church,
“My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He
hath taken up His child Israel, in remembrance of His mercy, as He spake to our fathers,
Abraham, and his seed for ever.”754 By these and such like [passages] the Gospel points out
that it was God who spake to the fathers; that it was He who, by Moses, instituted the legal
dispensation, by which giving of the law we know that He spake to the fathers. This same
God, after His great goodness, poured His compassion upon us, through which compassion
“the Day-spring from on high hath looked upon us, and appeared to those who sat in
darkness and the shadow of death, and has guided our feet into the way of peace;”755 as
Zacharias also, recovering from the state of dumbness which he had suffered on account of
unbelief, having been filled with a new spirit, did bless God in a new manner. For all things
had entered upon a new phase, the Word arranging after a new manner the advent in the
flesh, that He might win back756 to God that human nature (hominem) which had departed
from God; and therefore men were taught to worship God after a new fashion, but not another
god, because in truth there is but “one God, who justifieth the circumcision by faith,
and the uncircumcision through faith.”757 But Zacharias prophesying, exclaimed, “Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel; for He hath visited and redeemed His people, and hath raised up
an horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David; as He spake by the mouth of
His holy prophets, which have been since the world begun; salvation from our enemies, and
from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to
remember His holy covenant, the oath which He swore to our father Abraham, that He
would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve
Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him, all our days.”758 Then he says
to John: “And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before
the face of the Lord to prepare His ways; to give knowledge of salvation to His people, for
the remission of their sins.”759 For this is the knowledge of salvation which was wanting to

them, that of the Son of God, which John made known, saying, “Behold the Lamb of God,
who taketh away the sin of the world. This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man
who was made before me;760 because He was prior to me: and of His fulness have all we
received.”761 This, therefore, was the knowledge of salvation; but [it did not consist in] another
God, nor another Father, nor Bythus, nor the Pleroma of thirty Æons, nor the Mother
of the (lower) Ogdoad: but the knowledge of salvation was the knowledge of the Son of God,
who is both called and actually is, salvation, and Saviour, and salutary. Salvation, indeed,
as follows: “I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord.”762 And then again, Saviour: “Behold
my God, my Saviour, I will put my trust in Him.”763 But as bringing salvation, thus: “God
hath made known His salvation (salutare) in the sight of the heathen.”764 For He is indeed
Saviour, as being the Son and Word of God; but salutary, since [He is] Spirit; for he says:
“The Spirit of our countenance, Christ the Lord.”765 But salvation, as being flesh: for “the
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”766 This knowledge of salvation, therefore, John
did impart to those repenting, and believing in the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin
of the world.</p>
<p>3. And the angel of the Lord, he says, appeared to the shepherds, proclaiming joy to
them: “For767 there is born in the house of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Then
[appeared] a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory in the highest
to God, and on earth peace, to men of good will.”768 The falsely-called Gnostics say that
these angels came from the Ogdoad, and made manifest the descent of the superior Christ.
But they are again in error, when saying that the Christ and Saviour from above was not
born, but that also, after the baptism of the dispensational Jesus, he, [the Christ of the Pler-

oma,] descended upon him as a dove. Therefore, according to these men, the angels of the
Ogdoad lied, when they said, “For unto you is born this day a Saviour, who is Christ the
Lord, in the city of David.” For neither was Christ nor the Saviour born at that time, by their
account; but it was he, the dispensational Jesus, who is of the framer of the world, the
[Demiurge], and upon whom, after his baptism, that is, after [the lapse of] thirty years, they
maintain the Saviour from above descended. But why did [the angels] add, “in the city of
David,” if they did not proclaim the glad tidings of the fulfilment of God’s promise made
to David, that from the fruit of his body there should be an eternal King? For the Framer
[Demiurge] of the entire universe made promise to David, as David himself declares: “My
help is from God, who made heaven and earth;”769 and again: “In His hand are the ends of
the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. For the sea is His, and He did Himself
make it; and His hands founded the dry land. Come ye, let us worship and fall down before
Him, and weep in the presence of the Lord who made us; for He is the Lord our God.”770
The Holy Spirit evidently thus declares by David to those hearing him, that there shall be
those who despise Him who formed us, and who is God alone. Wherefore he also uttered
the foregoing words, meaning to say: See that ye do not err; besides or above Him there is
no other God, to whom ye should rather stretch out [your hands], thus rendering us pious
and grateful towards Him who made, established, and [still] nourishes us. What, then, shall
happen to those who have been the authors of so much blasphemy against their Creator?
This identical truth was also what the angels [proclaimed]. For when they exclaim, “Glory
to God in the highest, and in earth peace,” they have glorified with these words Him who
is the Creator of the highest, that is, of super-celestial things, and the Founder of everything
on earth: who has sent to His own handiwork, that is, to men, the blessing of His salvation
from heaven. Wherefore he adds: “The shepherds returned, glorifying God for all which
they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.”771 For the Israelitish shepherds did not
glorify another god, but Him who had been announced by the law and the prophets, the
Maker of all things, whom also the angels glorified. But if the angels who were from the
Ogdoad were accustomed to glorify any other, different from Him whom the shepherds
[adored], these angels from the Ogdoad brought to them error and not truth.</p>
<p>4. And still further does Luke say in reference to the Lord: “When the days of purification
were accomplished, they brought Him up to Jerusalem, to present Him before the Lord, as
it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male opening the womb shall be called holy
to the Lord; and that they should offer a sacrifice, as it is said in the law of the Lord, a pair
of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons:”772 in his own person most clearly calling Him Lord,

who appointed the legal dispensation. But “Simeon,” he also says, “blessed God, and said,
Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light for the revelation of the
Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.”773 And “Anna”774 also, “the prophetess,” he
says, in like manner glorified God when she saw Christ, “and spake of Him to all them who
were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.”775 Now by all these one God is shown forth,
revealing to men the new dispensation of liberty, the covenant, through the new advent of
His Son.</p>
<p>5. Wherefore also Mark, the interpreter and follower of Peter, does thus commence his
Gospel narrative: “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; as it is
written in the prophets, Behold, I send My messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare
Thy way.776 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
the paths straight before our God.” Plainly does the commencement of the Gospel quote
the words of the holy prophets, and point out Him at once, whom they confessed as God
and Lord; Him, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had also made promise to Him,
that He would send His messenger before His face, who was John, crying in the wilderness,
in “the spirit and power of Elias,”777 “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight paths
before our God.” For the prophets did not announce one and another God, but one and the
same; under various aspects, however, and many titles. For varied and rich in attribute is
the Father, as I have already shown in the book preceding778 this; and I shall show [the same
truth] from the prophets themselves in the further course of this work. Also, towards the
conclusion of his Gospel, Mark says: “So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He
was received up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God;”779 confirming what had
been spoken by the prophet: “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until
I make Thy foes Thy footstool.”780 Thus God and the Father are truly one and the same;

<head>Chapter XI—Proofs in continuation, extracted from St. John’s Gospel. The
Gospels are four in number, neither more nor less. Mystic reasons for this.</head>
<p>1. John, the disciple of the Lord, preaches this faith, and seeks, by the proclamation of
the Gospel, to remove that error which by Cerinthus had been disseminated among men,
and a long time previously by those termed Nicolaitans, who are an offset of that “knowledge”
falsely so called, that he might confound them, and persuade them that there is but one God,
who made all things by His Word; and not, as they allege, that the Creator was one, but the
Father of the Lord another; and that the Son of the Creator was, forsooth, one, but the Christ
from above another, who also continued impassible, descending upon Jesus, the Son of the
Creator, and flew back again into His Pleroma; and that Monogenes was the beginning, but
Logos was the true son of Monogenes; and that this creation to which we belong was not
made by the primary God, but by some power lying far below Him, and shut off from
communion with the things invisible and ineffable. The disciple of the Lord therefore desiring
to put an end to all such doctrines, and to establish the rule of truth in the Church, that
there is one Almighty God, who made all things by His Word, both visible and invisible;
showing at the same time, that by the Word, through whom God made the creation, He
also bestowed salvation on the men included in the creation; thus commenced His teaching
in the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and
without Him was nothing made.781 What was made was life in Him, and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.”782
“All things,” he says, “were made by Him;” therefore in “all things” this creation of ours is
[included], for we cannot concede to these men that [the words] “all things” are spoken in
reference to those within their Pleroma. For if their Pleroma do indeed contain these, this
creation, as being such, is not outside, as I have demonstrated in the preceding book;783 but
if they are outside the Pleroma, which indeed appeared impossible, it follows, in that case,
that their Pleroma cannot be “all things:” therefore this vast creation is not outside [the
Pleroma].</p>
<p>2. John, however, does himself put this matter beyond all controversy on our part, when
he says, “He was in this world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him
not. He came unto His own [things], and His own [people] received Him not.”784 But according
to Marcion, and those like him, neither was the world made by Him; nor did He

come to His own things, but to those of another. And, according to certain of the Gnostics,
this world was made by angels, and not by the Word of God. But according to the followers
of Valentinus, the world was not made by Him, but by the Demiurge. For he (Soter) caused
such similitudes to be made, after the pattern of things above, as they allege; but the Demiurge
accomplished the work of creation. For they say that he, the Lord and Creator of the plan
of creation, by whom they hold that this world was made, was produced from the Mother;
while the Gospel affirms plainly, that by the Word, which was in the beginning with God,
all things were made, which Word, he says, “was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”785</p>
<p>3. But, according to these men, neither was the Word made flesh, nor Christ, nor the
Saviour (Soter), who was produced from [the joint contributions of] all [the Æons]. For
they will have it, that the Word and Christ never came into this world; that the Saviour, too,
never became incarnate, nor suffered, but that He descended like a dove upon the dispensational
Jesus; and that, as soon as He had declared the unknown Father, He did again ascend
into the Pleroma. Some, however, make the assertion, that this dispensational Jesus did become
incarnate, and suffered, whom they represent as having passed through Mary just as
water through a tube; but others allege him to be the Son of the Demiurge, upon whom the
dispensational Jesus descended; while others, again, say that Jesus was born from Joseph
and Mary, and that the Christ from above descended upon him, being without flesh, and
impassible. But according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God
made flesh. For if anyone carefully examines the systems of them all, he will find that the
Word of God is brought in by all of them as not having become incarnate (sine carne) and
impassible, as is also the Christ from above. Others consider Him to have been manifested
as a transfigured man; but they maintain Him to have been neither born nor to have become
incarnate; whilst others [hold] that He did not assume a human form at all, but that, as a
dove, He did descend upon that Jesus who was born from Mary. Therefore the Lord’s disciple,
pointing them all out as false witnesses, says, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us.”786</p>
<p>4. And that we may not have to ask, Of what God was the Word made flesh? he does
himself previously teach us, saying, “There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John. The same came as a witness, that he might bear witness of that Light. He was not that
Light, but [came] that he might testify of the Light.”787 By what God, then, was John, the
forerunner, who testifies of the Light, sent [into the world]? Truly it was by Him, of whom
Gabriel is the angel, who also announced the glad tidings of his birth: [that God] who also
had promised by the prophets that He would send His messenger before the face of His

Son,788 who should prepare His way, that is, that he should bear witness of that Light in the
spirit and power of Elias.789 But, again, of what God was Elias the servant and the prophet?
Of Him who made heaven and earth,790 as he does himself confess. John, therefore, having
been sent by the founder and maker of this world, how could he testify of that Light, which
came down from things unspeakable and invisible? For all the heretics have decided that
the Demiurge was ignorant of that Power above him, whose witness and herald John is
found to be. Wherefore the Lord said that He deemed him “more than a prophet.”791 For
all the other prophets preached the advent of the paternal Light, and desired to be worthy
of seeing Him whom they preached; but John did both announce [the advent] beforehand,
in a like manner as did the others, and actually saw Him when He came, and pointed Him
out, and persuaded many to believe on Him, so that he did himself hold the place of both
prophet and apostle. For this is to be more than a prophet, because, “first apostles, secondarily
prophets;”792 but all things from one and the same God Himself.</p>
<p>5. That wine,793 which was produced by God in a vineyard, and which was first consumed,
was good. None794 of those who drank of it found fault with it; and the Lord partook
of it also. But that wine was better which the Word made from water, on the moment, and
simply for the use of those who had been called to the marriage. For although the Lord had
the power to supply wine to those feasting, independently of any created substance, and to
fill with food those who were hungry, He did not adopt this course; but, taking the loaves
which the earth had produced, and giving thanks,795 and on the other occasion making
water wine, He satisfied those who were reclining [at table], and gave drink to those who
had been invited to the marriage; showing that the God who made the earth, and commanded
it to bring forth fruit, who established the waters, and brought forth the fountains, was He
who in these last times bestowed upon mankind, by His Son, the blessing of food and the
favour of drink: the Incomprehensible [acting thus] by means of the comprehensible, and
the Invisible by the visible; since there is none beyond Him, but He exists in the bosom of
the Father.</p>

of His Son to those who love Him. By whom also Nathanael, being taught, recognised [Him],
he to whom also the Lord bare witness, that he was “an Israelite indeed, in whom was no
guile.”797 The Israelite recognised his King, therefore did he cry out to Him, “Rabbi, Thou
art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel.” By whom also Peter, having been taught,
recognised Christ as the Son of the living God, when [God] said, “Behold My dearly beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment
to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the
streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, until He
send forth judgment into contention;798 and in His name shall the Gentiles trust.”799</p>
<p>7. Such, then, are the first principles of the Gospel: that there is one God, the Maker of
this universe; He who was also announced by the prophets, and who by Moses set forth the
dispensation of the law,—[principles] which proclaim the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and ignore any other God or Father except Him. So firm is the ground upon which these
Gospels rest, that the very heretics themselves bear witness to them, and, starting from these
[documents], each one of them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the
Ebionites, who use Matthew’s Gospel800 only, are confuted out of this very same, making
false suppositions with regard to the Lord. But Marcion, mutilating that according to Luke,
is proved to be a blasphemer of the only existing God, from those [passages] which he still
retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ remained impassible,
but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the Gospel by Mark, if they read it with
a love of truth, may have their errors rectified. Those, moreover, who follow Valentinus,
making copious use of that according to John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved
to be totally in error by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book. Since,
then, our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our proof
derived from them is firm and true.</p>
<p>8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they
are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds,801

while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the “pillar and ground”802 of
the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars,
breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh. From which fact, it is
evident that the Word, the Artificer of all, He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains
all things, He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but
bound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, “Thou
that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth.”803 For the cherubim, too, were four-faced,
and their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture]
says, “The first living creature was like a lion,”804 symbolizing His effectual working, His
leadership, and royal power; the second [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His]
sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but “the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,”—an
evident description of His advent as a human being; “the fourth was like a flying eagle,”
pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the Church. And therefore
the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is seated. For that
according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious generation from the Father,
thus declaring, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God.”805 Also, “all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.”
For this reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence, for such is His person.806 But that
according to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with Zacharias the priest
offering sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated
for807 the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again, relates His generation as a man,
saying, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;”808
and also, “The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.” This, then, is the Gospel of His humanity;
809 for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a humble and meek man is kept
up through the whole Gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a reference to]
the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to men, saying, “The beginning of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the prophet,”—pointing to the winged aspect
of the Gospel; and on this account he made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such

is the prophetical character. And the Word of God Himself used to converse with the ante-
Mosaic patriarchs, in accordance with His divinity and glory; but for those under the law
he instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service.810 Afterwards, being made man for us, He
sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then,
as was the course followed by the Son of God, so was also the form of the living creatures;
and such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the Gospel.811
For the living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is also the course
followed by the Lord. For this reason were four principal (καθολικαί) covenants given to
the human race:812 one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge,
under Noah; the third, the giving of the law, under Moses; the fourth, that which renovates
man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon
its wings into the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>9. These things being so, all who destroy the form of the Gospel are vain, unlearned,
and also audacious; those, [I mean,] who represent the aspects of the Gospel as being either
more in number than as aforesaid, or, on the other hand, fewer. The former class [do so],
that they may seem to have discovered more than is of the truth; the latter, that they may
set the dispensations of God aside. For Marcion, rejecting the entire Gospel, yea rather,
cutting himself off from the Gospel, boasts that he has part in the [blessings of] the Gospel.813
Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set at nought the gift of the Spirit, which in
the latter times has been, by the good pleasure of the Father, poured out upon the human
race, do not admit that aspect [of the evangelical dispensation] presented by John’s Gospel,
in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete;814 but set aside at once both

the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit. Wretched men indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets,
forsooth, but who set aside the gift of prophecy from the Church; acting like those (the Encratitæ)
815 who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold themselves aloof from the
communion of the brethren. We must conclude, moreover, that these men (the Montanists)
can not admit the Apostle Paul either. For, in his Epistle to the Corinthians,816 he speaks
expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognises men and women prophesying in the Church.
Sinning, therefore, in all these particulars, against the Spirit of God,817 they fall into the irremissible
sin. But those who are from Valentinus, being, on the other hand, altogether
reckless, while they put forth their own compositions, boast that they possess more Gospels
than there really are. Indeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to entitle their
comparatively recent writing “the Gospel of Truth,” though it agrees in nothing with the
Gospels of the Apostles, so that they have really no Gospel which is not full of blasphemy.
For if what they have published is the Gospel of truth, and yet is totally unlike those which
have been handed down to us from the apostles, any who please may learn, as is shown from
the Scriptures themselves, that that which has been handed down from the apostles can no
longer be reckoned the Gospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true and reliable,
and admit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have proved by so
many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in due proportion and adaptation,
it was fit also that the outward aspect of the Gospel should be well arranged and harmonized.
The opinion of those men, therefore, who handed the Gospel down to us, having
been investigated, from their very fountainheads, let us proceed also to the remaining
apostles, and inquire into their doctrine with regard to God; then, in due course we shall
listen to the very words of the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Doctrine of the rest of the apostles.</head>
<p>1. The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord, and His assumption
into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the number of the twelve apostles, and in
electing into the place of Judas any substitute who should be chosen by God, thus addressed
those who were present: “Men [and] brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of David, spake before concerning Judas, which was
made guide to them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us:818 … Let his habitation
be desolate, and let no man dwell therein;819 and, His bishoprick let another take;”820—thus
leading to the completion of the apostles, according to the words spoken by David. Again,
when the Holy Ghost had descended upon the disciples, that they all might prophesy and
speak with tongues, and some mocked them, as if drunken with new wine, Peter said that
they were not drunken, for it was the third hour of the day; but that this was what had been
spoken by the prophet: “It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of
my Spirit upon all flesh, and they shall prophesy.”821 The God, therefore, who did promise
by the prophet, that He would send His Spirit upon the whole human race, was He who did
send; and God Himself is announced by Peter as having fulfilled His own promise.</p>
<p>2. For Peter said, “Ye men of Israel, hear my words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
by God among you by powers, and wonders, and signs, which God did by Him in the midst
of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determined counsel and
foreknowledge of God, by the hands of wicked men ye have slain, affixing [to the cross]:
whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that
he should be holden of them. For David speaketh concerning Him,822 I foresaw the Lord
always before my face; for He is on my right hand, lest I should be moved: therefore did my
heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also, my flesh shall rest in hope: because
Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou give Thy Holy One to see corruption.”
823 Then he proceeds to speak confidently to them concerning the patriarch David,
that he was dead and buried, and that his sepulchre is with them to this day. He said, “But
since he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit
of his body one should sit in his throne; foreseeing this, he spake of the resurrection of
Christ, that He was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see corruption. This Jesus,” he said,
“hath God raised up, of which we all are witnesses: who, being exalted by the right hand of

<pb n="1093"/>
God, receiving from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, hath shed forth this gift824
which ye now see and hear. For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he saith
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thy foes
Thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that
same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.”825 And when the multitudes
exclaimed, “What shall we do then?” Peter says to them, “Repent, and be baptized everyone
of you in the name of Jesus for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost.”826 Thus the apostles did not preach another God, or another Fulness; nor, that the
Christ who suffered and rose again was one, while he who flew off on high was another, and
remained impassible; but that there was one and the same God the Father, and Christ Jesus
who rose from the dead; and they preached faith in Him, to those who did not believe on
the Son of God, and exhorted them out of the prophets, that the Christ whom God promised
to send, He sent in Jesus, whom they crucified and God raised up.</p>
<p>3. Again, when Peter, accompanied by John, had looked upon the man lame from his
birth, before that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, sitting and seeking alms, he
said to him, “Silver and gold I have none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And immediately his legs and his feet received strength;
and he walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising
God.”827 Then, when a multitude had gathered around them from all quarters because of
this unexpected deed, Peter addressed them: “Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this; or
why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power we had made this man to walk?
The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath
glorified His Son, whom ye delivered up for judgment,828 and denied in the presence of
Pilate, when he wished to let Him go. But ye were bitterly set against829 the Holy One and
the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; but ye killed the Prince of life,
whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. And in the faith of His
name, him, whom ye see and know, hath His name made strong; yea, the faith which is by
Him, hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. And now, brethren,
I wot that through ignorance ye did this wickedness.830 … But those things which God before

had showed by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, and that831
the times of refreshing may come to you from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send
Jesus Christ, prepared for you beforehand,832 whom the heaven must indeed receive until
the times of the arrangement833 of all things, of which God hath spoken by His holy
prophets. For Moses truly said unto our fathers, Your Lord God shall raise up to you a
Prophet from your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He
shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, whosoever will not hear that
Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. And all [the prophets] from Samuel,
and henceforth, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the
children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying
unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first,
God, having raised up His Son, sent Him blessing you, that each may turn himself from his
iniquities.”834 Peter, together with John, preached to them this plain message of glad tidings,
that the promise which God made to the fathers had been fulfilled by Jesus; not certainly
proclaiming another god, but the Son of God, who also was made man, and suffered; thus
leading Israel into knowledge, and through Jesus preaching the resurrection of the dead,835
and showing, that whatever the prophets had proclaimed as to the suffering of Christ, these
had God fulfilled.</p>
<p>4. For this reason, too, when the chief priests were assembled, Peter, full of boldness,
said to them, “Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined by
you of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he has been made whole;
be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man
stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
is become the head-stone of the corner. [Neither is there salvation in any other: for] there
is none other name under heaven, which is given to men, whereby we must be saved:”836
Thus the apostles did not change God, but preached to the people that Christ was Jesus the

up, and gave in Him salvation to men.</p>
<p>5. They were confounded, therefore, both by this instance of healing (“for the man was
above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing took place”837), and by the doctrine
of the apostles, and by the exposition of the prophets, when the chief priests had sent away
Peter and John. [These latter] returned to the rest of their fellow-apostles and disciples of
the Lord, that is, to the Church, and related what had occurred, and how courageously they
had acted in the name of Jesus. The whole Church, it is then said, “when they had heard
that, lifted up the voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou art God, which hast
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; who, through the Holy Ghost,838
by the mouth of our father David, Thy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and
the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For of a truth, in this city,839 against Thy
holy Son Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy
counsel determined before to be done.”840 These [are the] voices of the Church from which
every Church had its origin; these are the voices of the metropolis of the citizens of the new
covenant; these are the voices of the apostles; these are voices of the disciples of the Lord,
the truly perfect, who, after the assumption of the Lord, were perfected by the Spirit, and
called upon the God who made heaven, and earth, and the sea,—who was announced by
the prophets,— and Jesus Christ His Son, whom God anointed, and who knew no other
[God]. For at that time and place there was neither Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor the rest
of these subverters [of the truth], and their adherents. Wherefore God, the Maker of all
things, heard them. For it is said, “The place was shaken where they were assembled together;
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness”
841 to every one that was willing to believe.842 “And with great power,” it is added,
“gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,”843 saying to them, “The

of wood: Him hath God raised up by His right hand844 to be a Prince and Saviour, to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are in this witnesses of these words;
as also is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that believe in Him.”845 “And
daily,” it is said, “in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and preach
Christ Jesus,”846 the Son of God. For this was the knowledge of salvation, which renders
those who acknowledge His Son’s advent perfect towards God.</p>
<p>6. But as some of these men impudently assert that the apostles, when preaching among
the Jews, could not declare to them another god besides Him in whom they (their hearers847)
believed, we say to them, that if the apostles used to speak to people in accordance with the
opinion instilled into them of old, no one learned the truth from them, nor, at a much
earlier date, from the Lord; for they say that He did Himself speak after the same fashion.
Wherefore neither do these men themselves know the truth; but since such was their opinion
regarding God, they had just received doctrine as they were able to hear it. According to
this manner of speaking, therefore, the rule of truth can be with nobody; but all learners
will ascribe this practice to all [teachers], that just as every person thought, and as far as his
capability extended, so was also the language addressed to him. But the advent of the Lord
will appear superfluous and useless, if He did indeed come intending to tolerate and to
preserve each man’s idea regarding God rooted in him from of old. Besides this, also, it was
a much heavier task, that He whom the Jews had seen as a man, and had fastened to the
cross, should be preached as Christ the Son of God, their eternal King. Since this, however,
was so, they certainly did not speak to them in accordance with their old belief. For they,
who told them to their face that they were the slayers of the Lord, would themselves also
much more boldly preach that Father who is above the Demiurge, and not what each individual
bid himself believe [respecting God]; and the sin was much less, if indeed they had
not fastened to the cross the superior Saviour (to whom it behoved them to ascend), since
He was impassible. For, as they did not speak to the Gentiles in compliance with their notions,
but told them with boldness that their gods were no gods, but the idols of demons; so would
they in like manner have preached to the Jews, if they had known another greater or more
perfect Father, not nourishing nor strengthening the untrue opinion of these men regarding
God. Moreover, while destroying the error of the Gentiles, and bearing them away from
their gods, they did not certainly induce another error upon them; but, removing those
which were no gods, they pointed out Him who alone was God and the true Father.</p>

<p>7. From the words of Peter, therefore, which he addressed in Cæsarea to Cornelius the
centurion, and those Gentiles with him, to whom the word of God was first preached, we
can understand what the apostles used to preach, the nature of their preaching, and their
idea with regard to God. For this Cornelius was, it is said, “a devout man, and one who
feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and praying to God always.
He saw therefore, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and
saying, Thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. Wherefore send to Simon, who
is called Peter.”848 But when Peter saw the vision, in which the voice from heaven said to
him, “What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common,”849 this happened [to teach
him] that the God who had, through the law, distinguished between clean and unclean, was
He who had purified the Gentiles through the blood of His Son—He whom also Cornelius
worshipped; to whom Peter, coming in, said, “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter
of persons: but in every nation, he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable
to Him.”850 He thus clearly indicates, that He whom Cornelius had previously feared as
God, of whom he had heard through the law and the prophets, for whose sake also he used
to give alms, is, in truth, God. The knowledge of the Son was, however, wanting to him;
therefore did [Peter] add, “The word, ye know, which was published throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached, Jesus of Nazareth, how God
anointed Him with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went about doing good, and
healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him. And we are witnesses
of all those things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they
slew, hanging Him on a beam of wood: Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him
openly; not to all the people, but unto us, witnesses chosen before of God, who did eat and
drink with Him after the resurrection from the dead. And He commanded us to preach
unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
quick and dead. To Him give all the prophets witness, that, through His name, every one
that believeth in Him does receive remission of sins.”851 The apostles, therefore, did preach
the Son of God, of whom men were ignorant; and His advent, to those who had been already
instructed as to God; but they did not bring in another god. For if Peter had known any
such thing, he would have preached freely to the Gentiles, that the God of the Jews was indeed
one, but the God of the Christians another; and all of them, doubtless, being awe-struck
because of the vision of the angel, would have believed whatever he told them. But it is
evident from Peter’s words that he did indeed still retain the God who was already known

to them; but he also bare witness to them that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, the Judge
of quick and dead, into whom he did also command them to be baptized for the remission
of sins; and not this alone, but he witnessed that Jesus was Himself the Son of God, who
also, having been anointed with the Holy Spirit, is called Jesus Christ. And He is the same
being that was born of Mary, as the testimony of Peter implies. Can it really be, that Peter
was not at that time as yet in possession of the perfect knowledge which these men discovered
afterwards? According to them, therefore, Peter was imperfect, and the rest of the apostles
were imperfect; and so it would be fitting that they, coming to life again, should become
disciples of these men, in order that they too might be made perfect. But this is truly ridiculous.
These men, in fact, are proved to be not disciples of the apostles, but of their own
wicked notions. To this cause also are due the various opinions which exist among them,
inasmuch as each one adopted error just as he was capable852 [of embracing it]. But the
Church throughout all the world, having its origin firm from the apostles, perseveres in one
and the same opinion with regard to God and His Son.</p>
<p>8. But again: Whom did Philip preach to the eunuch of the queen of the Ethiopians,
returning from Jerusalem, and reading Esaias the prophet, when he and this man were alone
together? Was it not He of whom the prophet spoke: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter,
and as a lamb dumb before the shearer, so He opened not the mouth?” “But who shall declare
His nativity? for His life shall be taken away from the earth.”853 [Philip declared] that this
was Jesus, and that the Scripture was fulfilled in Him; as did also the believing eunuch
himself: and, immediately requesting to be baptized, he said, “I believe Jesus Christ to be
the Son of God.”854 This man was also sent into the regions of Ethiopia, to preach what he
had himself believed, that there was one God preached by the prophets, but that the Son of
this [God] had already made [His] appearance in human nature (secundum hominem), and
had been led as a sheep to the slaughter; and all the other statements which the prophets
made regarding Him.</p>
<p>9. Paul himself also—after that the Lord spoke to him out of heaven, and showed him
that, in persecuting His disciples, he persecuted his own Lord, and sent Ananias to him that
he might recover his sight, and be baptized—“preached,” it is said, “Jesus in the synagogues
at Damascus, with all freedom of speech, that this is the Son of God, the Christ.”855 This is
the mystery which he says was made known to him by revelation, that He who suffered
under Pontius Pilate, the same is Lord of all, and King, and God, and Judge, receiving power
from Him who is the God of all, because He became “obedient unto death, even the death

of the cross.”856 And inasmuch as this is true, when preaching to the Athenians on the
Areopagus—where, no Jews being present, he had it in his power to preach God with freedom
of speech—he said to them: “God, who made the world, and all things therein, He, being
Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is He touched857
by men’s hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and breath, and
all things; who hath made from one blood the whole race of men to dwell upon the face of
the whole earth,858 predetermining the times according to the boundary of their habitation,
to seek the Deity, if by any means they might be able to track Him out, or find Him, although
He be not far from each of us. For in Him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain
men of your own have said, For we are also His offspring. Inasmuch, then, as we are the
offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like unto gold or silver, or stone
graven by art or man’s device. Therefore God, winking at the times of ignorance, does now
command all men everywhere to turn to Him with repentance; because He hath appointed
a day, on which the world shall be judged in righteousness by the man Jesus; whereof He
hath given assurance by raising Him from the dead.”859 Now in this passage he does not
only declare to them God as the Creator of the world, no Jews being present, but that He
did also make one race of men to dwell upon all the earth; as also Moses declared: “When
the Most High divided the nations, as He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of
the nations after the number of the angels of God;”860 but that people which believes in
God is not now under the power of angels, but under the Lord’s [rule]. “For His people
Jacob was made the portion of the Lord, Israel the cord of His inheritance.”861 And again,
at Lystra of Lycia (Lycaonia), when Paul was with Barnabas, and in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ had made a man to walk who had been lame from his birth, and when the crowd
wished to honour them as gods because of the astonishing deed, he said to them: “We are
men like unto you, preaching to you God, that ye may be turned away from these vain idols
to [serve] the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
therein; who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, although He left
not Himself without witness, performing acts of goodness, giving you rain from heaven,
and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.”862 But that all his Epistles

are consonant to these declarations, I shall, when expounding the apostle, show from the
Epistles themselves, in the right place. But while I bring out by these proofs the truths of
Scripture, and set forth briefly and compendiously things which are stated in various ways,
do thou also attend to them with patience, and not deem them prolix; taking this into account,
that proofs [of the things which are] contained in the Scriptures cannot be shown except
from the Scriptures themselves.</p>
<p>10. And still further, Stephen, who was chosen the first deacon by the apostles, and who,
of all men, was the first to follow the footsteps of the martyrdom of the Lord, being the first
that was slain for confessing Christ, speaking boldly among the people, and teaching them,
says: “The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, … and said to him, Get thee out
of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee; …
and He removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And He gave him none inheritance
in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet He promised that He would give it to
him for a possession, and to his seed after him. … And God spake on this wise, That his
seed should sojourn in a strange land, and should be brought into bondage, and should be
evil-entreated four hundred years; and the nation whom they shall serve will I judge, says
the Lord. And after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. And He gave him
the covenant of circumcision: and so [Abraham] begat Isaac.”863 And the rest of his words
announce the same God, who was with Joseph and with the patriarchs, and who spake with
Moses.</p>
<p>11. And that the whole range of the doctrine of the apostles proclaimed one and the
same God, who removed Abraham, who made to him the promise of inheritance, who in
due season gave to him the covenant of circumcision, who called his descendants out of
Egypt, preserved outwardly by circumcision—for he gave it as a sign, that they might not
be like the Egyptians—that He was the Maker of all things, that He was the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the God of glory,—they who wish may learn from the very
words and acts of the apostles, and may contemplate the fact that this God is one, above
whom is no other. But even if there were another god above Him, we should say, upon [instituting]
a comparison of the quantity [of the work done by each], that the latter is superior
to the former. For by deeds the better man appears, as I have already remarked;864 and,
inasmuch as these men have no works of their father to adduce, the latter is shown to be
God alone. But if any one, “doting about questions,”865 do imagine that what the apostles
have declared about God should be allegorized, let him consider my previous statements,
in which I set forth one God as the Founder and Maker of all things, and destroyed and laid

bare their allegations; and he shall find them agreeable to the doctrine of the apostles, and
so to maintain what they used to teach, and were persuaded of, that there is one God, the
Maker of all things. And when he shall have divested his mind of such error, and of that
blasphemy against God which it implies, he will of himself find reason to acknowledge that
both the Mosaic law and the grace of the new covenant, as both fitted for the times [at which
they were given], were bestowed by one and the same God for the benefit of the human
race.</p>
<p>12. For all those who are of a perverse mind, having been set against the Mosaic legislation,
judging it to be dissimilar and contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel, have not applied
themselves to investigate the causes of the difference of each covenant. Since, therefore, they
have been deserted by the paternal love, and puffed up by Satan, being brought over to the
doctrine of Simon Magus, they have apostatized in their opinions from Him who is God,
and imagined that they have themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding out
another god; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still somewhat under
the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are purer [in doctrine], and more
intelligent, than the apostles. Wherefore also Marcion and his followers have betaken
themselves to mutilating the Scriptures, not acknowledging some books at all; and, curtailing
the Gospel according to Luke and the Epistles of Paul, they assert that these are alone authentic,
which they have themselves thus shortened. In another work,866 however, I shall,
God granting [me strength], refute them out of these which they still retain. But all the rest,
inflated with the false name of “knowledge,” do certainly recognise the Scriptures; but they
pervert the interpretations, as I have shown in the first book. And, indeed, the followers of
Marcion do directly blaspheme the Creator, alleging him to be the creator of evils, [but]
holding a more tolerable867 theory as to his origin, [and] maintaining that there are two
beings, gods by nature, differing from each other,—the one being good, but the other evil.
Those from Valentinus, however, while they employ names of a more honourable kind, and
set forth that He who is Creator is both Father, and Lord, and God, do [nevertheless] render
their theory or sect more blasphemous, by maintaining that He was not produced from any
one of those Æons within the Pleroma, but from that defect which had been expelled beyond
the Pleroma. Ignorance of the Scriptures and of the dispensation of God has brought all
these things upon them. And in the course of this work I shall touch upon the cause of the
difference of the covenants on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of their unity and
harmony.</p>

<p>13. But that both the apostles and their disciples thus taught as the Church preaches,
and thus teaching were perfected, wherefore also they were called away to that which is
perfect— Stephen, teaching these truths, when he was yet on earth, saw the glory of God,
and Jesus on His right hand, and exclaimed, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son
of man standing on the right hand of God.”868 These words he said, and was stoned; and
thus did he fulfil the perfect doctrine, copying in every respect the Leader of martyrdom,
and praying for those who were slaying him, in these words: “Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge.” Thus were they perfected who knew one and the same God, who from beginning
to end was present with mankind in the various dispensations; as the prophet Hosea declares:
“I have filled up visions, and used similitudes by the hands of the prophets.”869 Those,
therefore, who delivered up their souls to death for Christ’s Gospel—how could they have
spoken to men in accordance with old-established opinion? If this had been the course adopted
by them, they should not have suffered; but inasmuch as they did preach things contrary
to those persons who did not assent to the truth, for that reason they suffered. It is
evident, therefore, that they did not relinquish the truth, but with all boldness preached to
the Jews and Greeks. To the Jews, indeed, [they proclaimed] that the Jesus who was crucified
by them was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and dead, and that He has received from
His Father an eternal kingdom in Israel, as I have pointed out; but to the Greeks they preached
one God, who made all things, and Jesus Christ His Son.</p>
<p>14. This is shown in a still clearer light from the letter of the apostles, which they forwarded
neither to the Jews nor to the Greeks, but to those who from the Gentiles believed in
Christ, confirming their faith. For when certain men had come down from Judea to Antioch—
where also, first of all, the Lord’s disciples were called Christians, because of their faith
in Christ—and sought to persuade those who had believed on the Lord to be circumcised,
and to perform other things after the observance of the law; and when Paul and Barnabas
had gone up to Jerusalem to the apostles on account of this question, and the whole Church
had convened together, Peter thus addressed them: “Men, brethren, ye know how that from
the days of old God made choice among you, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear
the word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, the Searcher of the heart, bare them witness,
giving them the Holy Ghost, even as to us; and put no difference between us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to impose a yoke upon
the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe
that, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to be saved, even as they.”870 After
him James spoke as follows: “Men, brethren, Simon hath declared how God did purpose to

<pb n="1103"/>
take from among the Gentiles a people for His name. And thus871 do the words of the
prophets agree, as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
of David, which is fallen down; and I will build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: that
the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, among whom my name
has been invoked, saith the Lord, doing these things.872 Known from eternity is His work
to God. Wherefore I for my part give judgment, that we trouble not them who from among
the Gentiles are turned to God: but that it be enjoined them, that they do abstain from the
vanities of idols, and from fornication, and from blood; and whatsoever873 they wish not
to be done to themselves, let them not do to others.”874 And when these things had been
said, and all had given their consent, they wrote to them after this manner: “The apostles,
and the presbyters, [and] the brethren, unto those brethren from among the Gentiles who
are in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we have heard that certain
persons going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye
must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: it seemed
good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our
beloved Barnabas and Paul; men who have delivered up their soul for the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, that they may declare our opinion by
word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater
burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from
blood, and from fornication; and whatsoever ye do not wish to be done to you, do not ye
to others: from which preserving yourselves, ye shall do well, walking875 in the Holy Spirit.”
From all these passages, then, it is evident that they did not teach the existence of another
Father, but gave the new covenant of liberty to those who had lately believed in God by the
Holy Spirit. But they clearly indicated, from the nature of the point debated by them, as to
whether or not it were still necessary to circumcise the disciples, that they had no idea of
another god.</p>
<p>15. Neither [in that case] would they have had such a tenor with regard to the first
covenant, as not even to have been willing to eat with the Gentiles. For even Peter, although
he had been sent to instruct them, and had been constrained by a vision to that effect, spake
nevertheless with not a little hesitation, saying to them: “Ye know how it is an unlawful

thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation;
but God hath shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. Therefore came
I without gainsaying;”876 indicating by these words, that he would not have come to them
unless he had been commanded. Neither, for a like reason, would he have given them baptism
so readily, had he not heard them prophesying when the Holy Ghost rested upon them.
And therefore did he exclaim, “Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?”877 He persuaded, at the same time, those
that were with him, and pointed out that, unless the Holy Ghost had rested upon them,
there might have been some one who would have raised objections to their baptism. And
the apostles who were with James allowed the Gentiles to act freely, yielding us up to the
Spirit of God. But they themselves, while knowing the same God, continued in the ancient
observances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, although
formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the vision, and of the Spirit who had rested
upon them, yet, when certain persons came from James, withdrew himself, and did not eat
with them. And Paul said that Barnabas likewise did the same thing.878 Thus did the apostles,
whom the Lord made witnesses of every action and of every doctrine—for upon all occasions
do we find Peter, and James, and John present with Him—scrupulously act according to
the dispensation of the Mosaic law, showing that it was from one and the same God; which
they certainly never would have done, as I have already said, if they had learned from the
Lord [that there existed] another Father besides Him who appointed the dispensation of
the law.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII—Refutation of the opinion, that Paul was the only apostle who
had knowledge of the truth.</head>
<p>1. With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that Paul alone knew the truth,
and that to him the mystery was manifested by revelation, let Paul himself convict them,
when he says, that one and the same God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of the circumcision,
and in himself for the Gentiles.879 Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God
whose was also Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God among those of the circumcision,
and likewise the Son of God, did Paul [declare] also among the Gentiles. For our Lord never
came to save Paul alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but one apostle
who knew the dispensation of His Son. And again, when Paul says, “How beautiful are the
feet of those bringing glad tidings of good things, and preaching the Gospel of peace,”880
he shows clearly that it was not merely one, but there were many who used to preach the
truth. And again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he had recounted all those who
had seen God881 after the resurrection, he says in continuation, “But whether it were I or
they, so we preach, and so ye believed,”882 acknowledging as one and the same, the
preaching of all those who saw God883 after the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>2. And again, the Lord replied to Philip, who wished to behold the Father, “Have I been
so long a time with you, and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He that sees Me, sees also
the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? For I am in the Father, and the
Father in Me; and henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.”884 To these men, therefore,
did the Lord bear witness, that in Himself they had both known and seen the Father (and
the Father is truth). To allege, then, that these men did not know the truth, is to act the part
of false witnesses, and of those who have been alienated from the doctrine of Christ. For
why did the Lord send the twelve apostles to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,885 if these
men did not know the truth? How also did the seventy preach, unless they had themselves
previously known the truth of what was preached? Or how could Peter have been in ignorance,
to whom the Lord gave testimony, that flesh and blood had not revealed to him, but
the Father, who is in heaven?886 Just, then, as “Paul [was] an apostle, not of men, neither

by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father,”887 [so with the rest;]888 the Son indeed
leading them to the Father, but the Father revealing to them the Son.</p>
<p>3. But that Paul acceded to [the request of] those who summoned him to the apostles,
on account of the question [which had been raised], and went up to them, with Barnabas,
to Jerusalem, not without reason, but that the liberty of the Gentiles might be confirmed by
them, he does himself say, in the Epistle to the Galatians: “Then, fourteen years after, I went
up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus. But I went up by revelation, and
communicated to them that Gospel which I preached among the Gentiles.”889 And again
he says, “For an hour we did give place to subjection,890 that the truth of the gospel might
continue with you.” If, then, any one shall, from the Acts of the Apostles, carefully scrutinize
the time concerning which it is written that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the
forementioned question, he will find those years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus
the statement of Paul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with, the testimony of
Luke regarding the apostles.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—If Paul had known any mysteries unrevealed to the other apostles,
Luke, his constant companion and fellow-traveller, could not have been ignorant
of them; neither could the truth have possibly lain hid from him, through whom
alone we learn many and most important particulars of the Gospel history.</head>
<p>1. But that this Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-labourer in the Gospel,
he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so by the truth
itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company
from Paul, and sailed to Cyprus, “we came to Troas;”891 and when Paul had beheld in a
dream a man of Macedonia, saying, “Come into Macedonia, Paul, and help us,” “immediately,”
he says, “we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had
called us to preach the Gospel unto them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our
ship’s course towards Samothracia.” And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their
journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: “for, sitting down,” he
says, “we spake unto the women who had assembled;”892 and certain believed, even a great
many. And again does he say, “But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened
bread, and came to Troas, where we abode seven days.”893 And all the remaining [details]
of his course with Paul he recounts, indicating with all diligence both places, and cities, and
number of days, until they went up to Jerusalem; and what befell Paul there,894 how he was
sent to Rome in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in charge;895 and the signs
of the ships, and how they made shipwreck;896 and the island upon which they escaped,
and how they received kindness there, Paul healing the chief man of that island; and how
they sailed from thence to Puteoli, and from that arrived at Rome; and for what period they
sojourned at Rome. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them
down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, because all
these [particulars] proved both that he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise,
and that he was not ignorant of the truth. That he was not merely a follower, but also a fellow-
labourer of the apostles, but especially of Paul, Paul has himself declared also in the
Epistles, saying: “Demas hath forsaken me, … and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens
to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me.”897 From this he shows that he was always
attached to and inseparable from him. And again he says, in the Epistle to the Colossi-

ans: “Luke, the beloved physician, greets you.”898 But surely if Luke, who always preached
in company with Paul, and is called by him “the beloved,” and with him performed the work
of an evangelist, and was entrusted to hand down to us a Gospel, learned nothing different
from him (Paul), as has been pointed out from his words, how can these men, who were
never attached to Paul, boast that they have learned hidden and unspeakable mysteries?</p>
<p>2. But that Paul taught with simplicity what he knew, not only to those who were [employed]
with him, but to those that heard him, he does himself make manifest. For when
the bishops and presbyters who came from Ephesus and the other cities adjoining had assembled
in Miletus, since he was himself hastening to Jerusalem to observe Pentecost, after
testifying many things to them, and declaring what must happen to him at Jerusalem, he
added: “I know that ye shall see my face no more. Therefore I take you to record this day,
that I am pure from the blood of all. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the
counsel of God. Take heed, therefore, both to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the
Holy Ghost has placed you as bishops, to rule the Church of the Lord,899 which He has acquired
for Himself through His own blood.”900 Then, referring to the evil teachers who
should arise, he said: “I know that after my departure shall grievous wolves come to you,
not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to
draw away disciples after them.” “I have not shunned,” he says, “to declare unto you all the
counsel of God.” Thus did the apostles simply, and without respect of persons, deliver to
all what they had themselves learned from the Lord. Thus also does Luke, without respect
of persons, deliver to us what he had learned from them, as he has himself testified, saying,
“Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and
ministers of the Word.”901</p>
<p>3. Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not know the truth, he will, [by so
acting,] manifestly reject that Gospel of which he claims to be a disciple. For through him
we have become acquainted with very many and important parts of the Gospel; for instance,
the generation of John, the history of Zacharias, the coming of the angel to Mary, the exclamation
of Elisabeth, the descent of the angels to the shepherds, the words spoken by them,
the testimony of Anna and of Simeon with regard to Christ, and that twelve years of age He
was left behind at Jerusalem; also the baptism of John, the number of the Lord’s years when
He was baptized, and that this occurred in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar. And in His

who laugh now, for ye shall weep;” and, “Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of
you: for so did your fathers to the false prophets.” All things of the following kind we have
known through Luke alone (and numerous actions of the Lord we have learned through
him, which also all [the Evangelists] notice): the multitude of fishes which Peter’s companions
enclosed, when at the Lord’s command they cast the nets;903 the woman who had suffered
for eighteen years, and was healed on the Sabbath-day;904 the man who had the dropsy,
whom the Lord made whole on the Sabbath, and how He did defend Himself for having
performed an act of healing on that day; how He taught His disciples not to aspire to the
uppermost rooms; how we should invite the poor and feeble, who cannot recompense us;
the man who knocked during the night to obtain loaves, and did obtain them, because of
the urgency of his importunity;905 how, when [our Lord] was sitting at meat with a Pharisee,
a woman that was a sinner kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment, with what the
Lord said to Simon on her behalf concerning the two debtors;906 also about the parable of
that rich man who stored up the goods which had accrued to him, to whom it was also said,
“In this night they shall demand thy soul from thee; whose then shall those things be which
thou hast prepared?”907 and similar to this, that of the rich man, who was clothed in purple
and who fared sumptuously, and the indigent Lazarus;908 also the answer which He gave
to His disciples when they said, “Increase our faith;”909 also His conversation with Zaccheus
the publican;910 also about the Pharisee and the publican, who were praying in the temple
at the same time;911 also the ten lepers, whom He cleansed in the way simultaneously;912
also how He ordered the lame and the blind to be gathered to the wedding from the lanes
and streets;913 also the parable of the judge who feared not God, whom the widow’s importunity
led to avenge her cause;914 and about the fig-tree in the vineyard which produced no

fruit. There are also many other particulars to be found mentioned by Luke alone, which
are made use of by both Marcion and Valentinus. And besides all these, [he records] what
[Christ] said to His disciples in the way, after the resurrection, and how they recognised
Him in the breaking of bread.915</p>
<p>4. It follows then, as of course, that these men must either receive the rest of his narrative,
or else reject these parts also. For no persons of common sense can permit them to receive
some things recounted by Luke as being true, and to set others aside, as if he had not known
the truth. And if indeed Marcion’s followers reject these, they will then possess no Gospel;
for, curtailing that according to Luke, as I have said already, they boast in having the Gospel
[in what remains]. But the followers of Valentinus must give up their utterly vain talk; for
they have taken from that [Gospel] many occasions for their own speculations, to put an
evil interpretation upon what he has well said. If, on the other hand, they feel compelled to
receive the remaining portions also, then, by studying the perfect Gospel, and the doctrine
of the apostles, they will find it necessary to repent, that they may be saved from the danger
[to which they are exposed].</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—Refutation of the Ebionites, who disparaged the authority of St.
Paul, from the writings of St. Luke, which must be received as a whole. Exposure
of the hypocrisy, deceit, and pride of the Gnostics. The apostles and their disciples
knew and preached one God, the Creator of the world.</head>
<p>1. But again, we allege the same against those who do not recognise Paul as an apostle:
that they should either reject the other words of the Gospel which we have come to know
through Luke alone, and not make use of them; or else, if they do receive all these, they must
necessarily admit also that testimony concerning Paul, when he (Luke) tells us that the Lord
spoke at first to him from heaven: “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? I am Jesus Christ,
whom thou persecutest;”916 and then to Ananias, saying regarding him: “Go thy way; for
he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name among the Gentiles, and kings, and the
children of Israel. For I will show him, from this time, how great things he must suffer for
My name’s sake.”917 Those, therefore, who do not accept of him [as a teacher], who was
chosen by God for this purpose, that he might boldly bear His name, as being sent to the
forementioned nations, do despise the election of God, and separate themselves from the
company of the apostles. For neither can they contend that Paul was no apostle, when he
was chosen for this purpose; nor can they prove Luke guilty of falsehood, when he proclaims
the truth to us with all diligence. It may be, indeed, that it was with this view that God set
forth very many Gospel truths, through Luke’s instrumentality, which all should esteem it
necessary to use, in order that all persons, following his subsequent testimony, which treats
upon the acts and the doctrine of the apostles, and holding the unadulterated rule of truth,
may be saved. His testimony, therefore, is true, and the doctrine of the apostles is open and
stedfast, holding nothing in reserve; nor did they teach one set of doctrines in private, and
another in public.</p>
<p>2. For this is the subterfuge of false persons, evil seducers, and hypocrites, as they act
who are from Valentinus. These men discourse to the multitude about those who belong
to the Church, whom they do themselves term “vulgar,” and “ecclesiastic.”918 By these words
they entrap the more simple, and entice them, imitating our phraseology, that these [dupes]
may listen to them the oftener; and then these are asked919 regarding us, how it is, that when
they hold doctrines similar to ours, we, without cause, keep ourselves aloof from their

company; and [how it is, that] when they say the same things, and hold the same doctrine,
we call them heretics? When they have thus, by means of questions, overthrown the faith
of any, and rendered them uncontradicting hearers of their own, they describe to them in
private the unspeakable mystery of their Pleroma. But they are altogether deceived, who
imagine that they may learn from the Scriptural texts adduced by heretics, that [doctrine]
which their words plausibly teach.920 For error is plausible, and bears a resemblance to the
truth, but requires to be disguised; while truth is without disguise, and therefore has been
entrusted to children. And if any one of their auditors do indeed demand explanations, or
start objections to them, they affirm that he is one not capable of receiving the truth, and
not having from above the seed [derived] from their Mother; and thus really give him no
reply, but simply declare that he is of the intermediate regions, that is, belongs to animal
natures. But if any one do yield himself up to them like a little sheep, and follows out their
practice, and their “redemption,” such an one is puffed up to such an extent, that he thinks
he is neither in heaven nor on earth, but that he has passed within the Pleroma; and having
already embraced his angel, he walks with a strutting gait and a supercilious countenance,
possessing all the pompous air of a cock. There are those among them who assert that that
man who comes from above ought to follow a good course of conduct; wherefore they do
also pretend a gravity [of demeanour] with a certain superciliousness. The majority, however,
having become scoffers also, as if already perfect, and living without regard [to appearances],
yea, in contempt [of that which is good], call themselves “the spiritual,” and allege that they
have already become acquainted with that place of refreshing which is within their Pleroma.</p>
<p>3. But let us revert to the same line of argument [hitherto pursued]. For when it has
been manifestly declared, that they who were the preachers of the truth and the apostles of
liberty termed no one else God, or named him Lord, except the only true God the Father,
and His Word, who has the pre-eminence in all things; it shall then be clearly proved, that
they (the apostles) confessed as the Lord God Him who was the Creator of heaven and earth,
who also spoke with Moses, gave to him the dispensation of the law, and who called the
fathers; and that they knew no other. The opinion of the apostles, therefore, and of those
(Mark and Luke) who learned from their words, concerning God, has been made manifest.</p>
<note type="footnote">920 Such is the sense educed by Harvey from the old Latin version, which thus runs: “Decipiuntur autem

and he discards the emendation proposed by the former editors, viz., “discernere” for “discere.”</note>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Proofs from the apostolic writings, that Jesus Christ was one
and the same, the only begotten Son of God, perfect God and perfect man.</head>
<p>1. But921 there are some who say that Jesus was merely a receptacle of Christ, upon
whom the Christ, as a dove, descended from above, and that when He had declared the
unnameable Father He entered into the Pleroma in an incomprehensible and invisible
manner: for that He was not comprehended, not only by men, but not even by those powers
and virtues which are in heaven, and that Jesus was the Son, but that922 Christ was the
Father, and the Father of Christ, God; while others say that He merely suffered in outward
appearance, being naturally impassible. The Valentinians, again, maintain that the dispensational
Jesus was the same who passed through Mary, upon whom that Saviour from the
more exalted [region] descended, who was also termed Pan,923 because He possessed the
names (vocabula) of all those who had produced Him; but that [this latter] shared with Him,
the dispensational one, His power and His name; so that by His means death was abolished,
but the Father was made known by that Saviour who had descended from above, whom
they do also allege to be Himself the receptacle of Christ and of the entire Pleroma; confessing,
indeed, in tongue one Christ Jesus, but being divided in [actual] opinion: for, as I have
already observed, it is the practice of these men to say that there was one Christ, who was
produced by Monogenes, for the confirmation of the Pleroma; but that another, the Saviour,
was sent [forth] for the glorification of the Father; and yet another, the dispensational one,
and whom they represent as having suffered, who also bore [in himself] Christ, that Saviour
who returned into the Pleroma. I judge it necessary therefore to take into account the entire
mind of the apostles regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, and to show that not only did they
never hold any such opinions regarding Him; but, still further, that they announced through
the Holy Spirit, that those who should teach such doctrines were agents of Satan, sent forth
for the purpose of overturning the faith of some, and drawing them away from life.</p>
<p>2. That John knew the one and the same Word of God, and that He was the only begotten,
and that He became incarnate for our salvation, Jesus Christ our Lord, I have sufficiently
proved from the word of John himself. And Matthew, too, recognising one and the same
Jesus Christ, exhibiting his generation as a man from the Virgin,924 even as God did
promise David that He would raise up from the fruit of his body an eternal King, having
made the same promise to Abraham a long time previously, says: “The book of the generation

of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.”925 Then, that he might free our mind
from suspicion regarding Joseph, he says: “But the birth of Christ926 was on this wise. When
His mother was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child
of the Holy Ghost.” Then, when Joseph had it in contemplation to put Mary away, since
she proved with child, [Matthew tells us of] the angel of God standing by him, and saying:
“Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save
His people from their sins. Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
of the Lord by the prophet: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they
shall call His name Emmanuel, which is, God with us;” clearly signifying that both the
promise made to the fathers had been accomplished, that the Son of God was born of a
virgin, and that He Himself was Christ the Saviour whom the prophets had foretold; not,
as these men assert, that Jesus was He who was born of Mary, but that Christ was He who
descended from above. Matthew might certainly have said, “Now the birth of Jesus was on
this wise;” but the Holy Ghost, foreseeing the corrupters [of the truth], and guarding by
anticipation against their deceit, says by Matthew, “But the birth of Christ was on this wise;”
and that He is Emmanuel, lest perchance we might consider Him as a mere man: for “not
by the will of the flesh nor by the will of man, but by the will of God was the Word made
flesh;”927 and that we should not imagine that Jesus was one, and Christ another, but should
know them to be one and the same.</p>
<p>3. Paul, when writing to the Romans, has explained this very point: “Paul, an apostle of
Jesus Christ, predestinated unto the Gospel of God, which He had promised by His prophets
in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was made to Him of the seed of David according
to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son of God with power through the Spirit
of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ.”928 And again,
writing to the Romans about Israel, he says: “Whose are the fathers, and from whom is
Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever.”929 And again, in his
Epistle to the Galatians, he says: “But when the fulness of time had come, God sent forth
His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,

that we might receive the adoption;”930 plainly indicating one God, who did by the prophets
make promise of the Son, and one Jesus Christ our Lord, who was of the seed of David according
to His birth from Mary; and that Jesus Christ was appointed the Son of God with
power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, as being the
first begotten in all the creation;931 the Son of God being made the Son of man, that through
Him we may receive the adoption,—humanity932 sustaining, and receiving, and embracing
the Son of God. Wherefore Mark also says: “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God; as it is written in the prophets.”933 Knowing one and the same Son of God,
Jesus Christ, who was announced by the prophets, who from the fruit of David’s body was
Emmanuel, “the messenger of great counsel of the Father;”934 through whom God caused
the day-spring and the Just One to arise to the house of David, and raised up for him an
horn of salvation, “and established a testimony in Jacob;”935 as David says when discoursing
on the causes of His birth: “And He appointed a law in Israel, that another generation might
know [Him,] the children which should he born from these, and they arising shall themselves
declare to their children, so that they might set their hope in God, and seek after His commandments.”
936 And again, the angel said, when bringing good tidings to Mary: “He shall
he great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto Him the
throne of His father David;”937 acknowledging that He who is the Son of the Highest, the
same is Himself also the Son of David. And David, knowing by the Spirit the dispensation
of the advent of this Person, by which He is supreme over all the living and dead, confessed
Him as Lord, sitting on the right hand of the Most High Father.938</p>

should not see death, until first he had beheld Christ Jesus— taking Him, the first-begotten
of the Virgin, into his hands, blessed God, and said, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word: because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which
Thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
of Thy people Israel;”939 confessing thus, that the infant whom he was holding in his hands,

Jesus, born of Mary, was Christ Himself, the Son of God, the light of all, the glory of Israel
itself, and the peace and refreshing of those who had fallen asleep. For He was already despoiling
men, by removing their ignorance, conferring upon them His own knowledge, and
scattering abroad those who recognised Him, as Esaias says: “Call His name, Quickly spoil,
Rapidly divide.”940 Now these are the works of Christ. He therefore was Himself Christ,
whom Simeon carrying [in his arms] blessed the Most High; on beholding whom the
shepherds glorified God; whom John, while yet in his mother’s womb, and He (Christ) in
that of Mary, recognising as the Lord, saluted with leaping; whom the Magi, when they had
seen, adored, and offered their gifts [to Him], as I have already stated, and prostrated
themselves to the eternal King, departed by another way, not now returning by the way of
the Assyrians. “For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, Father or mother, He shall
receive the power of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria, against the king of the Assyrians;”
941 declaring, in a mysterious manner indeed, but emphatically, that the Lord did fight
with a hidden hand against Amalek.942 For this cause, too, He suddenly removed those
children belonging to the house of David, whose happy lot it was to have been born at that
time, that He might send them on before into His kingdom; He, since He was Himself an
infant, so arranging it that human infants should be martyrs, slain, according to the Scriptures,
for the sake of Christ, who was born in Bethlehem of Judah, in the city of David.943</p>
<p>5. Therefore did the Lord also say to His disciples after the resurrection, “O thoughtless
ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ to
have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?”944 And again does He say to them:
“These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must
be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms,
concerning Me. Then opened He their understanding, that they should understand the
Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and
to rise again from the dead, and that repentance for the remission of sins be preached in
His name among all nations.”945 Now this is He who was born of Mary; for He says: “The
Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected, and crucified, and on the third day
rise again.”946 The Gospel, therefore, knew no other son of man but Him who was of Mary,
who also suffered; and no Christ who flew away from Jesus before the passion; but Him

who was born it knew as Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that this same suffered and rose
again, as John, the disciple of the Lord, verifies, saying: “But these are written, that ye might
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have eternal life
in His name,”947—foreseeing these blasphemous systems which divide the Lord, as far as
lies in their power, saying that He was formed of two different substances. For this reason
also he has thus testified to us in his Epistle: “Little children, it is the last time; and as ye
have heard that Antichrist doth come, now have many antichrists appeared; whereby we
know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, they would have continued with us: but [they departed], that they might be made
manifest that they are not of us. Know ye therefore, that every lie is from without, and is
not of the truth. Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist.”
948</p>
<p>6. But inasmuch as all those before mentioned, although they certainly do with their
tongue confess one Jesus Christ, make fools of themselves, thinking one thing and saying
another;949 for their hypotheses vary, as I have already shown, alleging, [as they do,] that
one Being suffered and was born, and that this was Jesus; but that there was another who
descended upon Him, and that this was Christ, who also ascended again; and they argue,
that he who proceeded from the Demiurge, or he who was dispensational, or he who sprang
from Joseph, was the Being subject to suffering; but upon the latter there descended from
the invisible and ineffable [places] the former, whom they assert to be incomprehensible,
invisible, and impassible: they thus wander from the truth, because their doctrine departs
from Him who is truly God, being ignorant that His only-begotten Word, who is always
present with the human race, united to and mingled with His own creation, according to
the Father’s pleasure, and who became flesh, is Himself Jesus Christ our Lord, who did also
suffer for us, and rose again on our behalf, and who will come again in the glory of His
Father, to raise up all flesh, and for the manifestation of salvation, and to apply the rule of
just judgment to all who were made by Him. There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one
God the Father, and one Christ Jesus, who came by means of the whole dispensational ar-
rangements [connected with Him], and gathered together all things in Himself.950 But in
every respect, too, He is man, the formation of God; and thus He took up man into Himself,

passible becoming capable of suffering, and the Word being made man, thus summing up
all things in Himself: so that as in super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the Word
of God is supreme, so also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy,
and, taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself Head of the Church,
He might draw all things to Himself at the proper time.</p>
<p>7. With Him is nothing incomplete or out of due season, just as with the Father there
is nothing incongruous. For all these things were foreknown by the Father; but the Son
works them out at the proper time in perfect order and sequence. This was the reason why,
when Mary was urging [Him] on to [perform] the wonderful miracle of the wine, and was
desirous before the time to partake951 of the cup of emblematic significance, the Lord,
checking her untimely haste, said, “Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not
yet come”952— waiting for that hour which was foreknown by the Father. This is also the
reason why, when men were often desirous to take Him, it is said, “No man laid hands upon
Him, for the hour of His being taken was not yet come;”953 nor the time of His passion,
which had been foreknown by the Father; as also says the prophet Habakkuk, “By this Thou
shalt be known when the years have drawn nigh; Thou shalt be set forth when the time
comes; because my soul is disturbed by anger, Thou shalt remember Thy mercy.”954 Paul
also says: “But when the fulness of time came, God sent forth His Son.”955 By which is made
manifest, that all things which had been foreknown of the Father, our Lord did accomplish
in their order, season, and hour, foreknown and fitting, being indeed one and the same, but
rich and great. For He fulfils the bountiful and comprehensive will of His Father, inasmuch
as He is Himself the Saviour of those who are saved, and the Lord of those who are under
authority, and the God of all those things which have been formed, the only-begotten of the
Father, Christ who was announced, and the Word of God, who became incarnate when the
fulness of time had come, at which the Son of God had to become the Son of man.</p>
<p>8. All, therefore, are outside of the [Christian] dispensation, who, under pretext of
knowledge, understand that Jesus was one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another,
from whom again is the Word, and that the Saviour is another, whom these disciples
of error allege to be a production of those who were made Æons in a state of degeneracy.
Such men are to outward appearance sheep; for they appear to be like us, by what they say
in public, repeating the same words as we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine

is homicidal, conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating many Fathers, but
lowering and dividing the Son of God in many ways. These are they against whom the Lord
has cautioned us beforehand; and His disciple, in his Epistle already mentioned, commands
us to avoid them, when he says: “For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Take heed to
them, that ye lose not what ye have wrought.”956 And again does he say in the Epistle: “Many
false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit
that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which separates
Jesus Christ is not of God, but is of antichrist.”957 These words agree with what was
said in the Gospel, that “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” Wherefore he
again exclaims in his Epistle, “Every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, has been born
of God;”958 knowing Jesus Christ to be one and the same, to whom the gates of heaven were
opened, because of His taking upon Him flesh: who shall also come in the same flesh in
which He suffered, revealing the glory of the Father.</p>
<p>9. Concurring with these statements, Paul, speaking to the Romans, declares: “Much
more they who receive abundance of grace and righteousness for [eternal] life, shall reign
by one, Christ Jesus.”959 It follows from this, that he knew nothing of that Christ who flew
away from Jesus; nor did he of the Saviour above, whom they hold to be impassible. For if,
in truth, the one suffered, and the other remained incapable of suffering, and the one was
born, but the other descended upon him who was born, and left him again, it is not one,
but two, that are shown forth. But that the apostle did know Him as one, both who was born
and who suffered, namely Christ Jesus, he again says in the same Epistle: “Know ye not, that
so many of us as were baptized in Christ Jesus were baptized in His death? that like as Christ
rose from the dead, so should we also walk in newness of life.”960 But again, showing that

<note type="footnote">957 1 John iv. 1, 2. This is a material difference from the received text of the passage: “Every spirit that confesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.” The Vulgate translation and Origen agree with Irenæus, and Tertullian
seems to recognise both readings (Adv. Marc., v. 16). Socrates tells us (vii. 32, p. 381) that the passage had been
corrupted by those who wished to separate the humanity of Christ from His divinity, and that the old copies
read, πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ λύει τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἔστι, which exactly agrees with Origen’s quotation, and
very nearly with that of Irenæus, now before us. Polycarp (Ep., c. vii.) seems to allude to the passage as we have
it now, and so does Ignatius (Ep. Smyr., c. v.). See the question discussed by Burton, in his Ante-Nicene Testimonies
[to the Div. of Christ. Another work of Burton has a similar name. See British Critic, vol. ii. (of 1827), p.

Christ did suffer, and was Himself the Son of God, who died for us, and redeemed us with
His blood at the time appointed beforehand, he says: “For how is it, that Christ, when we
were yet without strength, in due time died for the ungodly? But God commendeth His love
towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being
now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled,
we shall be saved by His life.”961 He declares in the plainest manner, that the same Being
who was laid hold of, and underwent suffering, and shed His blood for us, was both Christ
and the Son of God, who did also rise again, and was taken up into heaven, as he himself
[Paul] says: “But at the same time, [it, is] Christ [that] died, yea rather, that is risen again,
who is even at the right hand of God.”962 And again, “Knowing that Christ, rising from the
dead, dieth no more:”963 for, as himself foreseeing, through the Spirit, the subdivisions of
evil teachers [with regard to the Lord’s person], and being desirous of cutting away from
them all occasion of cavil, he says what has been already stated, [and also declares:] “But if
the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies.”964 This he does not utter to those
alone who wish to hear: Do not err, [he says to all:] Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is one and
the same, who did by suffering reconcile us to God, and rose from the dead; who is at the
right hand of the Father, and perfect in all things; “who, when He was buffeted, struck not
in return; who, when He suffered, threatened not;”965 and when He underwent tyranny,
He prayed His Father that He would forgive those who had crucified Him. For He did
Himself truly bring in salvation: since He is Himself the Word of God, Himself the Onlybegotten
of the Father, Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The apostles teach that it was neither Christ nor the Saviour,
but the Holy Spirit, who did descend upon Jesus. The reason for this descent.</head>
<p>1. It certainly was in the power of the apostles to declare that Christ descended upon
Jesus, or that the so-called superior Saviour [came down] upon the dispensational one, or
he who is from the invisible places upon him from the Demiurge; but they neither knew
nor said anything of the kind: for, had they known it, they would have also certainly stated
it. But what really was the case, that did they record, [namely,] that the Spirit of God as a
dove descended upon Him; this Spirit, of whom it was declared by Isaiah, “And the Spirit
of God shall rest upon Him,”966 as I have already said. And again: “The Spirit of the Lord
is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me.”967 That is the Spirit of whom the Lord declares,
“For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”968 And
again, giving to the disciples the power of regeneration into God,969 He said to them, “Go
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.”970 For [God] promised, that in the last times He would pour Him [the Spirit]
upon [His] servants and handmaids, that they might prophesy; wherefore He did also descend
upon the Son of God, made the Son of man, becoming accustomed in fellowship with Him
to dwell in the human race, to rest with human beings, and to dwell in the workmanship of
God, working the will of the Father in them, and renewing them from their old habits into
the newness of Christ.</p>
<p>2. This Spirit did David ask for the human race, saying, “And stablish me with Thine
all-governing Spirit;”971 who also, as Luke says, descended at the day of Pentecost upon the
disciples after the Lord’s ascension, having power to admit all nations to the entrance of
life, and to the opening of the new covenant; from whence also, with one accord in all languages,
they uttered praise to God, the Spirit bringing distant tribes to unity, and offering
to the Father the first-fruits of all nations. Wherefore also the Lord promised to send the
Comforter,972 who should join us to God. For as a compacted lump of dough cannot be

formed of dry wheat without fluid matter, nor can a loaf possess unity, so, in like manner,
neither could we, being many, be made one in Christ Jesus without the water from heaven.
And as dry earth does not bring forth unless it receive moisture, in like manner we also,
being originally a dry tree, could never have brought forth fruit unto life without the voluntary
rain from above. For our bodies have received unity among themselves by means of that
laver which leads to incorruption; but our souls, by means of the Spirit. Wherefore both are
necessary, since both contribute towards the life of God, our Lord compassionating that
erring Samaritan woman973—who did not remain with one husband, but committed fornication
by [contracting] many marriages—by pointing out, and promising to her living water,
so that she should thirst no more, nor occupy herself in acquiring the refreshing water obtained
by labour, having in herself water springing up to eternal life. The Lord, receiving
this as a gift from His Father, does Himself also confer it upon those who are partakers of
Himself, sending the Holy Spirit upon all the earth.</p>
<p>3. Gideon,974 that Israelite whom God chose, that he might save the people of Israel
from the power of foreigners, foreseeing this gracious gift, changed his request, and prophesied
that there would be dryness upon the fleece of wool (a type of the people), on which
alone at first there had been dew; thus indicating that they should no longer have the Holy
Spirit from God, as saith Esaias, “I will also command the clouds, that they rain no rain
upon it,”975 but that the dew, which is the Spirit of God, who descended upon the Lord,
should be diffused throughout all the earth, “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of God.”976
This Spirit, again, He did confer upon the Church, sending throughout all the world the
Comforter from heaven, from whence also the Lord tells us that the devil, like lightning,
was cast down.977 Wherefore we have need of the dew of God, that we be not consumed by
fire, nor be rendered unfruitful, and that where we have an accuser there we may have also
an Advocate,978 the Lord commending to the Holy Spirit His own man,979 who had fallen
among thieves,980 whom He Himself compassionated, and bound up his wounds, giving
two royal denaria; so that we, receiving by the Spirit the image and superscription of the

Father and the Son, might cause the denarium entrusted to us to be fruitful, counting out
the increase [thereof] to the Lord.981</p>
<p>4. The Spirit, therefore, descending under the predestined dispensation, and the Son of
God, the Only-begotten, who is also the Word of the Father, coming in the fulness of time,
having become incarnate in man for the sake of man, and fulfilling all the conditions of
human nature, our Lord Jesus Christ being one and the same, as He Himself the Lord doth
testify, as the apostles confess, and as the prophets announce,—all the doctrines of these
men who have invented putative Ogdoads and Tetrads, and imagined subdivisions [of the
Lord’s person], have been proved falsehoods. These982 men do, in fact, set the Spirit aside
altogether; they understand that Christ was one and Jesus another; and they teach that there
was not one Christ, but many. And if they speak of them as united, they do again separate
them: for they show that one did indeed undergo sufferings, but that the other remained
impassible; that the one truly did ascend to the Pleroma, but the other remained in the intermediate
place; that the one does truly feast and revel in places invisible and above all
name, but that the other is seated with the Demiurge, emptying him of power. It will
therefore be incumbent upon thee, and all others who give their attention to this writing,
and are anxious about their own salvation, not readily to express acquiescence when they
hear abroad the speeches of these men: for, speaking things resembling the [doctrine of the]
faithful, as I have already observed, not only do they hold opinions which are different, but
absolutely contrary, and in all points full of blasphemies, by which they destroy those persons
who, by reason of the resemblance of the words, imbibe a poison which disagrees with their
constitution, just as if one, giving lime mixed with water for milk, should mislead by the
similitude of the colour; as a man983 superior to me has said, concerning all that in any way
corrupt the things of God and adulterate the truth, “Lime is wickedly mixed with the milk
of God.”</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Continuation of the foregoing argument. Proofs from the
writings of St. Paul, and from the words of Our Lord, that Christ and Jesus cannot
be considered as distinct beings; neither can it be alleged that the Son of God
became man merely in appearance, but that He did so truly and actually.</head>
<p>1.984 As it has been clearly demonstrated that the Word, who existed in the beginning
with God, by whom all things were made, who was also always present with mankind, was
in these last days, according to the time appointed by the Father, united to His own workmanship,
inasmuch as He became a man liable to suffering, [it follows] that every objection
is set aside of those who say, “If our Lord was born at that time, Christ had therefore no
previous existence.” For I have shown that the Son of God did not then begin to exist, being
with the Father from the beginning; but when He became incarnate, and was made man,
He commenced afresh985 the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive
manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost in Adam—namely, to be according
to the image and likeness of God—that we might recover in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2. For as it was not possible that the man who had once for all been conquered, and who
had been destroyed through disobedience, could reform himself, and obtain the prize of
victory; and as it was also impossible that he could attain to salvation who had fallen under
the power of sin,—the Son effected both these things, being the Word of God, descending
from the Father, becoming incarnate, stooping low, even to death, and consummating the
arranged plan of our salvation, upon whom [Paul], exhorting us unhesitatingly to believe,
again says, “Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring down Christ; or who shall descend
into the deep? that is, to liberate Christ again from the dead.”986 Then he continues, “If thou
shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath
raised Him from the dead, thou shall be saved.”987 And he renders the reason why the Son
of God did these things, saying, “For to this end Christ both lived, and died, and revived,
that He might rule over the living and the dead.”988 And again, writing to the Corinthians,
he declares, “But we preach Christ Jesus crucified;”989 and adds, “The cup of blessing which
we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?”990</p>

<p>3. But who is it that has had fellowship with us in the matter of food? Whether is it he
who is conceived of by them as the Christ above, who extended himself through Horos, and
imparted a form to their mother; or is it He who is from the Virgin, Emmanuel, who did
eat butter and honey,991 of whom the prophet declared, “He is also a man, and who shall
know him?”992 He was likewise preached by Paul: “For I delivered,” he says, “unto you first
of all, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and
rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.”993 It is plain, then, that Paul knew no
other Christ besides Him alone, who both suffered, and was buried, and rose gain, who was
also born, and whom he speaks of as man. For after remarking, “But if Christ be preached,
that He rose from the dead,”994 he continues, rendering the reason of His incarnation, “For
since by man came death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.” And everywhere,
when [referring to] the passion of our Lord, and to His human nature, and His subjection
to death, he employs the name of Christ, as in that passage: “Destroy not him with thy meat
for whom Christ died.”995 And again: “But now, in Christ, ye who sometimes were far off
are made nigh by the blood of Christ.”996 And again: “Christ has redeemed us from the
curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth
upon a tree.”997 And again: “And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
whom Christ died;”998 indicating that the impassible Christ did not descend upon Jesus,
but that He Himself, because He was Jesus Christ, suffered for us; He, who lay in the tomb,
and rose again, who descended and ascended,—the Son of God having been made the Son
of man, as the very name itself doth declare. For in the name of Christ is implied, He that
anoints, He that is anointed, and the unction itself with which He is anointed. And it is the
Father who anoints, but the Son who is anointed by the Spirit, who is the unction, as the
Word declares by Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed
me,”999—pointing out both the anointing Father, the anointed Son, and the unction, which
is the Spirit.</p>
<p>4. The Lord Himself, too, makes it evident who it was that suffered; for when He asked
the disciples, “Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?”1000 and when Peter had replied,

“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;” and when he had been commended by
Him [in these words], “That flesh and blood had not revealed it to him, but the Father who
is in heaven,” He made it clear that He, the Son of man, is Christ the Son of the living God.
“For from that time forth,” it is said, “He began to show to His disciples, how that He must
go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the priests, and be rejected, and crucified,
and rise again the third day.”1001 He who was acknowledged by Peter as Christ, who pronounced
him blessed because the Father had revealed the Son of the living God to him, said
that He must Himself suffer many things, and be crucified; and then He rebuked Peter, who
imagined that He was the Christ as the generality of men supposed1002 [that the Christ
should be], and was averse to the idea of His suffering, [and] said to the disciples, “If any
man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For
whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose it for My sake shall save
it.”1003 For these things Christ spoke openly, He being Himself the Saviour of those who
should be delivered over to death for their confession of Him, and lose their lives.</p>
<p>5. If, however, He was Himself not to suffer, but should fly away from Jesus, why did
He exhort His disciples to take up the cross and follow Him,—that cross which these men
represent Him as not having taken up, but [speak of Him] as having relinquished the dispensation
of suffering? For that He did not say this with reference to the acknowledging of
the Stauros (cross) above, as some among them venture to expound, but with respect to the
suffering which He should Himself undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies
when He says, “For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall
find it.” And that His disciples must suffer for His sake, He [implied when He] said to the
Jews, “Behold, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall
kill and crucify.”1004 And to the disciples He was wont to say, “And ye shall stand before
governors and kings for My sake; and they shall scourge some of you, and slay you, and
persecute you from city to city.”1005 He knew, therefore, both those who should suffer persecution,
and He knew those who should have to be scourged and slain because of Him;
and He did not speak of any other cross, but of the suffering which He should Himself undergo
first, and His disciples afterwards. For this purpose did He give them this exhortation:
“Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who
is able to send both soul and body into hell;”1006 [thus exhorting them] to hold fast those

professions of faith which they had made in reference to Him. For He promised to confess
before His Father those who should confess His name before men; but declared that He
would deny those who should deny Him, and would be ashamed of those who should be
ashamed to confess Him. And although these things are so, some of these men have proceeded
to such a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt upon the martyrs, and
vituperate those who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who suffer all
things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive to follow the footprints of the
Lord’s passion, having become martyrs of the suffering One; these we do also enrol with
the martyrs themselves. For, when inquisition shall be made for their blood,1007 and they
shall attain to glory, then all shall be confounded by Christ, who have cast a slur upon their
martyrdom. And from this fact, that He exclaimed upon the cross, “Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do,”1008 the long-suffering, patience, compassion, and goodness
of Christ are exhibited, since He both suffered, and did Himself exculpate those who had
maltreated Him. For the Word of God, who said to us, “Love your enemies, and pray for
those that hate you,”1009 Himself did this very thing upon the cross; loving the human race
to such a degree, that He even prayed for those putting Him to death. If, however, any one,
going upon the supposition that there are two [Christs], forms a judgment in regard to

one, who, in the midst of His own wounds and stripes, and the other [cruelties] inflicted
upon Him, was beneficent, and unmindful of the wrongs perpetrated upon Him, than he
who flew away, and sustained neither injury nor insult.</p>
<p>6. This also does likewise meet [the case] of those who maintain that He suffered only
in appearance. For if He did not truly suffer, no thanks to Him, since there was no suffering
at all; and when we shall actually begin to suffer, He will seem as leading us astray, exhorting
us to endure buffering, and to turn the other1010 cheek, if He did not Himself before us in
reality suffer the same; and as He misled them by seeming to them what He was not, so does
He also mislead us, by exhorting us to endure what He did not endure Himself. [In that
case] we shall be even above the Master, because we suffer and sustain what our Master
never bore or endured. But as our Lord is alone truly Master, so the Son of God is truly good
and patient, the Word of God the Father having been made the Son of man. For He fought

and conquered; for He was man contending for the fathers,1011 and through obedience
doing away with disobedience completely: for He bound the strong man,1012 and set free
the weak, and endowed His own handiwork with salvation, by destroying sin. For He is a
most holy and merciful Lord, and loves the human race.</p>
<p>7. Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (human nature) to cleave to and to
become, one with God. For unless man had overcome the enemy of man, the enemy would
not have been legitimately vanquished. And again: unless it had been God who had freely
given salvation, we could never have possessed it securely. And unless man had been joined
to God, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent
upon the Mediator between God and men, by His relationship to both, to bring both to
friendship and concord, and present man to God, while He revealed God to man.1013 For,
in what way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had received from Him
through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself, unless His Word, having been
made flesh, had entered into communion with us? Wherefore also He passed through every
stage of life, restoring to all communion with God. Those, therefore, who assert that He
appeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor truly made man, are as yet under
the old condemnation, holding out patronage to sin; for, by their showing, death has not
been vanquished, which “reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned
after the similitude of Adam’s transgression.”1014 But the law coming, which was given by
Moses, and testifying of sin that it is a sinner, did truly take away his (death’s) kingdom,
showing that he was no king, but a robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however,
a weighty burden upon man, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to death.
For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it.
For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man. For it behoved Him who was to
destroy sin, and redeem man under the power of death, that He should Himself be made
that very same thing which he was, that is, man; who had been drawn by sin into bondage,
but was held by death, so that sin should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth
from death. For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from
virgin soil, the many were made sinners,1015 and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by
the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified

“God, true are His works.”1016 But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh,
His work was not a true one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated
in Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive death of its power,
and vivify man; and therefore His works are true.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Jesus Christ was not a mere man, begotten from Joseph in the
ordinary course of nature, but was very God, begotten of the Father most high,
and very man, born of the Virgin.</head>
<p>1. But again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten by Joseph, remaining
in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state of death having been not as
yet joined to the Word of God the Father, nor receiving liberty through the Son, as He does
Himself declare: “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”1017 But, being ignorant
of Him who from the Virgin is Emmanuel, they are deprived of His gift, which is
eternal life;1018 and not receiving the incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and
are debtors to death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says, mentioning
His own gift of grace: “I said, Ye are all the sons of the Highest, and gods; but ye shall die
like men.”1019 He speaks undoubtedly these words to those who have not received the gift
of adoption, but who despise the incarnation of the pure generation of the Word of God,1020
defraud human nature of promotion into God, and prove themselves ungrateful to the Word
of God, who became flesh for them. For it was for this end that the Word of God was made
man, and He who was the Son of God became the Son of man, that man, having been taken
into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might become the son of God. For by no other
means could we have attained to incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united
to incorruptibility and immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and
immortality, unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also
are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the mortal by
immortality, that we might receive the adoption of sons?</p>

revealed Him,1023 knows Him, so that he understands that He who “was not born either by
the will of the flesh, or by the will of man,”1024 is the Son of man, this is Christ, the Son of
the living God. For I have shown from the Scriptures,1025 that no one of the sons of Adam
is as to everything, and absolutely, called God, or named Lord. But that He is Himself in
His own right, beyond all men who ever lived, God, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the
Incarnate Word, proclaimed by all the prophets, the apostles, and by the Spirit Himself,
may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion of the truth. Now, the Scriptures
would not have testified these things of Him, if, like others, He had been a mere man. But
that He had, beyond all others, in Himself that pre-eminent birth which is from the Most
High Father, and also experienced that pre-eminent generation which is from the Virgin,1026
the divine Scriptures do in both respects testify of Him: also, that He was a man without
comeliness, and liable to suffering;1027 that He sat upon the foal of an ass;1028 that He received
for drink, vinegar and gall;1029 that He was despised among the people, and humbled
Himself even to death and that He is the holy Lord, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the
Beautiful in appearance, and the Mighty God,1030 coming on the clouds as the Judge of all
men;1031—all these things did the Scriptures prophesy of Him.</p>
<p>3. For as He became man in order to undergo temptation, so also was He the Word that
He might be glorified; the Word remaining quiescent, that He might be capable of being
tempted, dishonoured, crucified, and of suffering death, but the human nature being swallowed
up in it (the divine), when it conquered, and endured [without yielding], and performed
acts of kindness, and rose again, and was received up [into heaven]. He therefore,
the Son of God, our Lord, being the Word of the Father, and the Son of man, since He had
a generation as to His human nature from Mary—who was descended from mankind, and
who was herself a human being—was made the Son of man.1032 Wherefore also the Lord
Himself gave us a sign, in the depth below, and in the height above, which man did not ask
for, because he never expected that a virgin could conceive, or that it was possible that one
remaining a virgin could bring forth a son, and that what was thus born should be “God

<head>Chapter XX.—God showed himself, by the fall of man, as patient, benign,
merciful, mighty to save. Man is therefore most ungrateful, if, unmindful of his
own lot, and of the benefits held out to him, he do not acknowledge divine grace.</head>
<p>1. Long-suffering therefore was God, when man became a defaulter, as foreseeing that
victory which should be granted to him through the Word. For, when strength was made
perfect in weakness,1035 it showed the kindness and transcendent power of God. For as He
patiently suffered Jonah to be swallowed by the whale, not that he should be swallowed up
and perish altogether, but that, having been cast out again, he might be the more subject to
God, and might glorify Him the more who had conferred upon him such an unhoped-for
deliverance, and might bring the Ninevites to a lasting repentance, so that they should be
converted to the Lord, who would deliver them from death, having been struck with awe
by that portent which had been wrought in Jonah’s case, as the Scripture says of them, “And
they returned each from his evil way, and the unrighteousness which was in their hands,
saying, Who knoweth if God will repent, and turn away His anger from us, and we shall not
perish?”1036—so also, from the beginning, did God permit man to be swallowed up by the
great whale, who was the author of transgression, not that he should perish altogether when
so engulphed; but, arranging and preparing the plan of salvation, which was accomplished
by the Word, through the sign of Jonah, for those who held the same opinion as Jonah regarding
the Lord, and who confessed, and said, “I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship
the Lord God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.”1037 [This was done] that
man, receiving an unhoped-for salvation from God, might rise from the dead, and glorify
God, and repeat that word which was uttered in prophecy by Jonah: “I cried by reason of
mine affliction to the Lord my God, and He heard me out of the belly of hell;”1038 and that
he might always continue glorifying God, and giving thanks without ceasing, for that salvation
which he has derived from Him, “that no flesh should glory in the Lord’s presence;”1039
and that man should never adopt an opposite opinion with regard to God, supposing that
the incorruptibility which belongs to him is his own naturally, and by thus not holding the
truth, should boast with empty superciliousness, as if he were naturally like to God. For he
(Satan) thus rendered him (man) more ungrateful towards his Creator, obscured the love
which God had towards man, and blinded his mind not to perceive what is worthy of God,
comparing himself with, and judging himself equal to, God.</p>

<p>2. This, therefore, was the [object of the] long-suffering of God, that man, passing
through all things, and acquiring the knowledge of moral discipline, then attaining to the
resurrection from the dead, and learning by experience what is the source of his deliverance,
may always live in a state of gratitude to the Lord, having obtained from Him the gift of incorruptibility,
that he might love Him the more; for “he to whom more is forgiven, loveth
more:”1040 and that he may know himself, how mortal and weak he is; while he also understands
respecting God, that He is immortal and powerful to such a degree as to confer immortality
upon what is mortal, and eternity upon what is temporal; and may understand
also the other attributes of God displayed towards himself, by means of which being instructed
he may think of God in accordance with the divine greatness. For the glory of man [is]
God, but [His] works [are the glory] of God; and the receptacle of all His wisdom and power
[is] man. Just as the physician is proved by his patients, so is God also revealed through
men. And therefore Paul declares, “For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that He may
have mercy upon all;”1041 not saying this in reference to spiritual Æons, but to man, who
had been disobedient to God, and being cast off from immortality, then obtained mercy,
receiving through the Son of God that adoption which is [accomplished] by Himself. For
he who holds, without pride and boasting, the true glory (opinion) regarding created things
and the Creator, who is the Almighty God of all, and who has granted existence to all; [such
an one,] continuing in His love1042 and subjection, and giving of thanks, shall also receive
from Him the greater glory of promotion,1043 looking forward to the time when he shall
become like Him who died for him, for He, too, “was made in the likeness of sinful flesh,”1044
to condemn sin, and to cast it, as now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, but that
He might call man forth into His own likeness, assigning him as [His own] imitator to God,
and imposing on him His Father’s law, in order that he may see God, and granting him
power to receive the Father; [being]1045 the Word of God who dwelt in man, and became
the Son of man, that He might accustom man to receive God, and God to dwell in man,
according to the good pleasure of the Father.</p>

<p>3. On this account, therefore, the Lord Himself,1046 who is Emmanuel from the Virgin,
1047 is the sign of our salvation, since it was the Lord Himself who saved them, because
they could not be saved by their own instrumentality; and, therefore, when Paul sets forth
human infirmity, he says: “For I know that there dwelleth in my flesh no good thing,”1048
showing that the “good thing” of our salvation is not from us, but from God. And again:
“Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”1049 Then he
introduces the Deliverer, [saying,] “The grace of Jesus Christ our Lord.” And Isaiah declares
this also, [when he says:] “Be ye strengthened, ye hands that hang down, and ye feeble knees;
be ye encouraged, ye feeble-minded; be comforted, fear not: behold, our God has given
judgment with retribution, and shall recompense: He will come Himself, and will save
us.”1050 Here we see, that not by ourselves, but by the help of God, we must be saved.</p>

flesh—for the angels are without flesh—[the same prophet] announced, saying: “Neither
an elder,1051 nor angel, but the Lord Himself will save them because He loves them, and
will spare them: He will Himself set them free.”1052 And that He should Himself become
very man, visible, when He should be the Word giving salvation, Isaiah again says: “Behold,
city of Zion: thine eyes shall see our salvation.”1053 And that it was not a mere man who
died for us, Isaiah says: “And the holy Lord remembered His dead Israel, who had slept in
the land of sepulture; and He came down to preach His salvation to them, that He might
save them.”1054 And Amos (Micah) the prophet declares the same: “He will turn again, and

south of the inheritance, and that [He is] man. For he says, “His feet shall advance in the

<head>Chapter XXI.—A vindication of the prophecy in Isa. vii. 14 against the
misinterpretations of Theodotion, Aquila, the Ebionites, and the Jews. Authority
of the Septuagint version. Arguments in proof that Christ was born of a virgin.</head>
<p>1. God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the token of
the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to expound the Scripture,
[thus:] “Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bring forth a son,”1060 as Theodotion
the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus,1061 both Jewish proselytes. The
Ebionites, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as
in them lies, such a marvellous dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the
prophets which proceeded from God. For truly this prediction was uttered before the removal
of the people to Babylon; that is, anterior to the supremacy acquired by the Medes and
Persians. But it was interpreted into Greek by the Jews themselves, much before the period
of our Lord’s advent, that there might remain no suspicion that perchance the Jews, complying
with our humour, did put this interpretation upon these words. They indeed, had they
been cognizant of our future existence, and that we should use these proofs from the
Scriptures, would themselves never have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures, which do
declare that all other nations partake of [eternal] life, and show that they who boast themselves
as being the house of Jacob and the people of Israel, are disinherited from the grace
of God.</p>
<p>2. For before the Romans possessed their kingdom,1062 while as yet the Macedonians
held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious to adorn the library which he had
founded in Alexandria, with a collection of the writings of all men, which were [works] of
merit, made request to the people of Jerusalem, that they should have their Scriptures
translated into the Greek language. And they—for at that time they were still subject to the
Macedonians—sent to Ptolemy seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled in the
Scriptures and in both the languages, to carry out what he had desired.1063 But he, wishing

to test them individually, and fearing lest they might perchance, by taking counsel together,
conceal the truth in the Scriptures, by their interpretation, separated them from each other,
and commanded them all to write the same translation. He did this with respect to all the
books. But when they came together in the same place before Ptolemy, and each of them
compared his own interpretation with that of every other, God was indeed glorified, and
the Scriptures were acknowledged as truly divine. For all of them read out the common
translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the very same names,
from beginning to end, so that even the Gentiles present perceived that the Scriptures had
been interpreted by the inspiration of God.1064 And there was nothing astonishing in God
having done this,—He who, when, during the captivity of the people under Nebuchadnezzar,
the Scriptures had been corrupted, and when, after seventy years, the Jews had returned to
their own land, then, in the times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, inspired Esdras the
priest, of the tribe of Levi, to recast1065 all the words of the former prophets, and to re-establish
with the people the Mosaic legislation.</p>
<p>3. Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been interpreted with such fidelity, and by the
grace of God, and since from these God has prepared and formed again our faith towards
His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures in Egypt, where the house of
Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved
when He fled from the persecution set on foot by Herod; and [since] this interpretation of
these Scriptures was made prior to our Lord’s descent [to earth], and came into being before
the Christians appeared —for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the reign of
Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the Scriptures were interpreted;—[
since these things are so, I say,] truly these men are proved to be impudent and
presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute
them out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the advent of the Son of God.
But our faith is stedfast, unfeigned, and the only true one, having clear proof from these
Scriptures, which were interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the Church
is without interpolation. For the apostles, since they are of more ancient date than all these

<p>4. For the one and the same Spirit of God, who proclaimed by the prophets what and
of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did by these elders give a just interpretation
of what had been truly prophesied; and He did Himself, by the apostles, announce that the
fulness of the times of the adoption had arrived, that the kingdom of heaven had drawn
nigh, and that He was dwelling within those that believe on Him who was born Emmanuel
of the Virgin. To this effect they testify, [saying,] that before Joseph had come together with
Mary, while she therefore remained in virginity, “she was found with child of the Holy
Ghost;”1067 and that the angel Gabriel said unto her, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing
which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God;”1068 and that the angel said to
Joseph in a dream, “Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah
the prophet, Behold, a virgin shall be with child.”1069 But the elders have thus interpreted
what Esaias said: “And the Lord, moreover, said unto Ahaz, Ask for thyself a sign from the
Lord thy God out of the depth below, or from the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not
ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said, It is not a small thing1070 for you to weary
men; and how does the Lord weary them? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign;
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name Emmanuel. Butter
and honey shall He eat: before He knows or chooses out things that are evil, He shall exchange
them for what is good; for before the child knows good or evil, He shall not consent to evil,
that He may choose that which is good.”1071 Carefully, then, has the Holy Ghost pointed
out, by what has been said, His birth from a virgin, and His essence, that He is God (for the
name Emmanuel indicates this). And He shows that He is a man, when He says, “Butter
and honey shall He eat;” and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying,] “before He
knows good and evil;” for these are all the tokens of a human infant. But that He “will not
consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good,”—this is proper to God; that by the
fact, that He shall eat butter and honey, we should not understand that He is a mere man
only, nor, on the other hand, from the name Emmanuel, should suspect Him to be God
without flesh.</p>

<p>5. And when He says, “Hear, O house of David,”1072 He performed the part of one in-
dicating that He whom God promised David that He would raise up from the fruit of his
belly (ventris) an eternal King, is the same who was born of the Virgin, herself of the lineage
of David. For on this account also, He promised that the King should be “of the fruit of his
belly,” which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to a virgin conceiving, and not
“of the fruit of his loins,” nor “of the fruit of his reins,” which expression is appropriate to
a generating man, and a woman conceiving by a man. In this promise, therefore, the Scripture
excluded all virile influence; yet it certainly is not mentioned that He who was born was not
from the will of man. But it has fixed and established “the fruit of the belly,” that it might
declare the generation of Him who should be [born] from the Virgin, as Elisabeth testified
when filled with the Holy Ghost, saying to Mary, “Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy belly;”1073 the Holy Ghost pointing out to those willing to hear,
that the promise which God had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [David’s] belly,
was fulfilled in the birth from the Virgin, that is, from Mary. Let those, therefore, who alter
the passage of Isaiah thus, “Behold, a young woman shall conceive,” and who will have Him
to be Joseph’s son, also alter the form of the promise which was given to David, when God
promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his belly, the horn of Christ the King. But they
did not understand, otherwise they would have presumed to alter even this passage also.</p>
<p>6. But what Isaiah said, “From the height above, or from the depth beneath,”1074 was
meant to indicate, that “He who descended was the same also who ascended.”1075 But in
this that he said, “The Lord Himself shall give you a sign,” he declared an unlooked-for
thing with regard to His generation, which could have been accomplished in no other way
than by God the Lord of all, God Himself giving a sign in the house of David. For what great
thing or what sign should have been in this, that a young woman conceiving by a man should
bring forth,—a thing which happens to all women that produce offspring? But since an
unlooked-for salvation was to be provided for men through the help of God, so also was the
unlooked-for birth from a virgin accomplished; God giving this sign, but man not working
it out.</p>
<p>7. On this account also, Daniel,1076 foreseeing His advent, said that a stone, cut out
without hands, came into this world. For this is what “without hands” means, that His
coming into this world was not by the operation of human hands, that is, of those men who
are accustomed to stone-cutting; that is, Joseph taking no part with regard to it, but Mary

<pb n="1141"/>
alone co-operating with the pre-arranged plan. For this stone from the earth derives existence
from both the power and the wisdom of God. Wherefore also Isaiah says: “Thus saith the
Lord, Behold, I deposit in the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, the chief, the
corner-one, to be had in honour.”1077 So, then, we understand that His advent in human
nature was not by the will of a man, but by the will of God.</p>
<p>8. Wherefore also Moses giving a type, cast his rod upon the earth,1078 in order that it,
by becoming flesh, might expose and swallow up all the opposition of the Egyptians, which
was lifting itself up against the pre-arranged plan of God;1079 that the Egyptians themselves
might testify that it is the finger of God which works salvation for the people, and not the
son of Joseph. For if He were the son of Joseph, how could He be greater than Solomon, or
greater than Jonah,1080 or greater than David,1081 when He was generated from the same
seed, and was a descendant of these men? And how was it that He also pronounced Peter
blessed, because he acknowledged Him to be the Son of the living God?1082</p>
<p>9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, according to
Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to be the son of Joachim and Jechoniah,
as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree.1083 But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were
disinherited from the kingdom; Jeremiah thus declaring, “As I live, saith the Lord, if
Jechoniah the son of Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of my right hand, I
would pluck him thence, and deliver him into the hand of those seeking thy life.”1084 And
again: “Jechoniah is dishonoured as a useless vessel, for he has been cast into a land which
he knew not. Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man a disinherited person; for
none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, shall prosper, or be a prince in Judah.”1085
And again, God speaks of Joachim his father: “Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning
Joachim his father, king of Judea, There shall be from him none sitting upon the throne of
David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the heat of day, and in the frost of night. And

I will look upon him, and upon his sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, upon the land of Judah, all the evils that I have pronounced against them.”1086
Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and that they have hope in Him,
do cause themselves to be disinherited from the kingdom, failing under the curse and rebuke
directed against Jechoniah and his seed. Because for this reason have these things been
spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] Spirit foreknowing the doctrines of the evil
teachers; that they may learn that from his seed—that is, from Joseph—He was not to be
born but that, according to the promise of God, from David’s belly the King eternal is raised
up, who sums up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself the ancient formation
[of man].1087</p>
<p>10. For as by one man’s disobedience sin entered, and death obtained [a place] through
sin; so also by the obedience of one man, righteousness having been introduced, shall cause
life to fructify in those persons who in times past were dead.1088 And as the protoplast
himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet virgin soil (“for God had not yet
sent rain, and man had not tilled the ground”1089), and was formed by the hand of God,
that is, by the Word of God, for “all things were made by Him,”1090 and the Lord took dust
from the earth and formed man; so did He who is the Word, recapitulating Adam in Himself,
rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather up Adam [into Himself], from Mary, who
was as yet a virgin. If, then, the first Adam had a man for his father, and was born of human
seed, it were reasonable to say that the second Adam was begotten of Joseph. But if the
former was taken from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was incumbent that the latter
also, making a recapitulation in Himself, should be formed as man by God, to have an analogy
with the former as respects His origin. Why, then, did not God again take dust, but wrought
so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that there might not be another
formation called into being, nor any other which should [require to] be saved, but that the
very same formation should be summed up [in Christ as had existed in Adam], the analogy
having been preserved.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Christ assumed actual flesh, conceived and born of the Virgin.</head>
<p>1. Those, therefore, who allege that He took nothing from the Virgin do greatly err,
[since,] in order that they may cast away the inheritance of the flesh, they also reject the
analogy [between Him and Adam]. For if the one [who sprang] from the earth had indeed
formation and substance from both the hand and workmanship of God, but the other not
from the hand and workmanship of God, then He who was made after the image and likeness
of the former did not, in that case, preserve the analogy of man, and He must seem an inconsistent
piece of work, not having wherewith He may show His wisdom. But this is to
say, that He also appeared putatively as man when He was not man, and that He was made
man while taking nothing from man. For if He did not receive the substance of flesh from
a human being, He neither was made man nor the Son of man; and if He was not made
what we were, He did no great thing in what He suffered and endured. But every one will
allow that we are [composed of] a body taken from the earth, and a soul receiving spirit
from God. This, therefore, the Word of God was made, recapitulating in Himself His own
handiwork; and on this account does He confess Himself the Son of man, and blesses “the
meek, because they shall inherit the earth.”1091 The Apostle Paul, moreover, in the Epistle
to the Galatians, declares plainly, “God sent His Son, made of a woman.”1092 And again, in
that to the Romans, he says, “Concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of David according
to the flesh, who was predestinated as the Son of God with power, according to the
spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.”1093</p>
<p>2.1094 Superfluous, too, in that case is His descent into Mary; for why did He come down
into her if He were to take nothing of her? Still further, if He had taken nothing of Mary,
He would never have availed Himself of those kinds of food which are derived from the
earth, by which that body which has been taken from the earth is nourished; nor would He
have hungered, fasting those forty days, like Moses and Elias, unless His body was craving
after its own proper nourishment; nor, again, would John His disciple have said, when
writing of Him, “But Jesus, being wearied with the journey, was sitting [to rest];”1095 nor
would David have proclaimed of Him beforehand, “They have added to the grief of my
wounds;”1096 nor would He have wept over Lazarus, nor have sweated great drops of blood;

nor have declared, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful;”1097 nor, when His side was pierced,
would there have come forth blood and water. For all these are tokens of the flesh which
had been derived from the earth, which He had recapitulated in Himself, bearing salvation
to His own handiwork.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore Luke points out that the pedigree which traces the generation of our Lord
back to Adam contains seventy-two generations, connecting the end with the beginning,
and implying that it is He who has summed up in Himself all nations dispersed from Adam
downwards, and all languages and generations of men, together with Adam himself. Hence
also was Adam himself termed by Paul “the figure of Him that was to come,”1098 because
the Word, the Maker of all things, had formed beforehand for Himself the future dispensation
of the human race, connected with the Son of God; God having predestined that the first
man should be of an animal nature, with this view, that he might be saved by the spiritual
One. For inasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what
might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should
not exist in vain.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with this design, Mary the Virgin is found obedient, saying, “Behold
the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.”1099 But Eve was disobedient;
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed a husband,
Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in Paradise “they were both naked, and
were not ashamed,”1100 inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had
no understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they should first
come to adult age,1101 and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient,
was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary,
having a man betrothed [to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience,
become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race. And on this account
does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of him who had betrothed her, although
she was as yet a virgin; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because
what is joined together could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the process
by which these bonds of union had arisen;1102 so that the former ties be cancelled by the
latter, that the latter may set the former again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that

<note type="footnote">1102 Literally, “unless these bonds of union be turned backwards.</note>

<pb n="1145"/>
the first compact looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position of the
first which has been cancelled.1103 For this reason did the Lord declare that the first should
in truth be last, and the last first.1104 And the prophet, too, indicates the same, saying, “instead
of fathers, children have been born unto thee.”1105 For the Lord, having been born “the
First-begotten of the dead,”1106 and receiving into His bosom the ancient fathers, has regenerated
them into the life of God, He having been made Himself the beginning of those that
live, as Adam became the beginning of those who die.1107 Wherefore also Luke, commencing
the genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated
them into the Gospel of life, and not they Him. And thus also it was that the knot of
Eve’s disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound
fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Arguments in opposition to Tatian, showing that it was
consonant to divine justice and mercy that the first Adam should first partake
in that salvation offered to all by Christ.</head>
<p>1. It was necessary, therefore, that the Lord, coming to the lost sheep, and making recapitulation
of so comprehensive a dispensation, and seeking after His own handiwork,
should save that very man who had been created after His image and likeness, that is, Adam,
filling up the times of His condemnation, which had been incurred through disobedience,—[
times] “which the Father had placed in His own power.”1108 [This was necessary,]
too, inasmuch as the whole economy of salvation regarding man came to pass according to
the good pleasure of the Father, in order that God might not be conquered, nor His wisdom
lessened, [in the estimation of His creatures.] For if man, who had been created by God that
he might live, after losing life, through being injured by the serpent that had corrupted him,
should not any more return to life, but should be utterly [and for ever] abandoned to death,
God would [in that case] have been conquered, and the wickedness of the serpent would
have prevailed over the will of God. But inasmuch as God is invincible and long-suffering,
He did indeed show Himself to be long-suffering in the matter of the correction of man and
the probation of all, as I have already observed; and by means of the second man did He
bind the strong man, and spoiled his goods,1109 and abolished death, vivifying that man
who had been in a state of death. For as the first Adam became a vessel in his (Satan’s)
possession, whom he did also hold under his power, that is, by bringing sin on him iniquitously,
and under colour of immortality entailing death upon him. For, while promising that
they should be as gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he wrought death in
them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was justly captured in his turn by God; but
man, who had been led captive, was loosed from the bonds of condemnation.</p>
<p>2. But this is Adam, if the truth should be told, the first formed man, of whom the
Scripture says that the Lord spake, “Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness;”1110
and we are all from him: and as we are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title.
But inasmuch as man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created the original man should
be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was so deeply injured by the enemy,
and was the first to suffer captivity, was not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but
that his children were, —those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would
the enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with him. To give an
illustration: If a hostile force had overcome certain [enemies], had bound them, and led
them away captive, and held them for a long time in servitude, so that they begat children
<note type="footnote">1108 Acts i. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">1109 Matt. xii. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1110 Gen. i. 26.</note>

<pb n="1147"/>
among them; and somebody, compassionating those who had been made slaves, should
overcome this same hostile force; he certainly would not act equitably, were he to liberate
the children of those who had been led captive, from the sway of those who had enslaved
their fathers, but should leave these latter, who had suffered the act of capture, subject to
their enemies,—those, too, on whose very account he had proceeded to this retaliation,—
the children succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their fathers’ cause, but not1111
so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be left [in bondage]. For
God is neither devoid of power nor of justice, who has afforded help to man, and restored
him to His own liberty.</p>
<p>3. It was for this reason, too, that immediately after Adam had transgressed, as the
Scripture relates, He pronounced no curse against Adam personally, but against the ground,
in reference to his works, as a certain person among the ancients has observed: “God did
indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it might not remain in man.”1112 But man received,
as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of tilling the earth, and to eat bread
in the sweat of his face, and to return to the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also
did the woman [receive] toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of parturition, and a
state of subjection, that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither
perish altogether when cursed by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to
despise God. But the curse in all its fulness fell upon the serpent, which had beguiled them.
“And God,” it is declared, “said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou
above all cattle, and above all the beasts of the earth.”1113 And this same thing does the Lord
also say in the Gospel, to those who are found upon the left hand: “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath prepared for the devil and his angels;”1114
indicating that eternal fire was not originally prepared for man, but for him who beguiled
man, and caused him to offend—for him, I say, who is chief of the apostasy, and for those
angels who became apostates along with him; which [fire], indeed, they too shall justly feel,
who, like him, persevere in works of wickedness, without repentance, and without retracing
their steps.</p>

but with envy and malice thought that he could domineer over him, not only did not acquiesce,
but even added sin to sin, indicating his state of mind by his action. For what he had
planned, that did he also put in practice: he tyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting
the just to the unjust, that the former might be proved as the just one by the things which
he suffered, and the latter detected as the unjust by those which he perpetrated. And he was
not softened even by this, nor did he stop short with that evil deed; but being asked where
his brother was, he said, “I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” extending and aggravating
[his] wickedness by his answer. For if it is wicked to slay a brother, much worse is it thus
insolently and irreverently to reply to the omniscient God as if he could battle Him. And
for this he did himself bear a curse about with him, because he gratuitously brought an offering
of sin, having had no reverence for God, nor being put to confusion by the act of
fratricide.1116</p>
<p>5. The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this, but was altogether different.
For, having been beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality, he is immediately
seized with terror, and hides himself; not as if he were able to escape from God; but, in a
state of confusion at having transgressed His command, he feels unworthy to appear before
and to hold converse with God. Now, “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;”1117
the sense of sin leads to repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those who are
penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means of the girdle
[which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there were many other leaves, which
would have irritated his body in a less degree. He, however, adopted a dress conformable
to his disobedience, being awed by the fear of God; and resisting the erring, the lustful
propensity of his flesh (since he had lost his natural disposition and child-like mind, and
had come to the knowledge of evil things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself
and his wife, fearing God, and waiting for His coming, and indicating, as it were, some such
thing [as follows]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have by disobedience lost that robe of sanctity
which I had from the Spirit, I do now also acknowledge that I am deserving of a covering
of this nature, which affords no gratification, but which gnaws and frets the body. And he
would no doubt have retained this clothing for ever, thus humbling himself, if God, who is
merciful, had not clothed them with tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves. For this purpose,
too, He interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the woman; and again, He interrogates
her, that she might convey the blame to the serpent. For she related what had occurred.
“The serpent,” says she, “beguiled me, and I did eat.”1118 But He put no question

to the serpent; for He knew that he had been the prime mover in the guilty deed; but He
pronounced the curse upon him in the first instance, that it might fall upon man with a
mitigated rebuke. For God detested him who had led man astray, but by degrees, and little
by little, He showed compassion to him who had been beguiled.</p>
<p>6. Wherefore also He drove him out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of
life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture to assert, but because He
pitied him, [and did not desire] that he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin
which surrounded him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable. But
He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease,1119
putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so
that man, ceasing at length to live to sin, and dying to it, might begin to live to God.</p>
<p>7. For this end did He put enmity between the serpent and the woman and her seed,
they keeping it up mutually: He, the sole of whose foot should be bitten, having power also
to tread upon the enemy’s head; but the other biting, killing, and impeding the steps of man,
until the seed did come appointed to tread down his head,—which was born of Mary, of
whom the prophet speaks: “Thou shalt tread upon the asp and the basilisk; thou shalt trample
down the lion and the dragon;”1120—indicating that sin, which was set up and spread out
against man, and which rendered him subject to death, should be deprived of its power,
along with death, which rules [over men]; and that the lion, that is, antichrist, rampant
against mankind in the latter days, should be trampled down by Him; and that He should
bind “the dragon, that old serpent”1121 and subject him to the power of man, who had been
conquered1122 so that all his might should be trodden down. Now Adam had been conquered,
all life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when the foe was conquered in his
turn, Adam received new life; and the last enemy, death, is destroyed,1123 which at the first
had taken possession of man. Therefore, when man has been liberated, “what is written
shall come to pass, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?”1124 This
could not be said with justice, if that man, over whom death did first obtain dominion, were
not set free. For his salvation is death’s destruction. When therefore the Lord vivifies man,
that is, Adam, death is at the same time destroyed.</p>
<p>8. All therefore speak falsely who disallow his (Adam’s) salvation, shutting themselves
out from life for ever, in that they do not believe that the sheep which had perished has been

False, therefore, is that man who first started this idea, or rather, this ignorance and
blindness—Tatian.1126 As I have already indicated, this man entangled himself with all the
heretics.1127 This dogma, however, has been invented by himself, in order that, by introducing
something new, independently of the rest, and by speaking vanity, he might acquire for
himself hearers void of faith, affecting to be esteemed a teacher, and endeavouring from
time to time to employ sayings of this kind often [made use of] by Paul: “In Adam we all
die;”1128 ignorant, however, that “where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”1129
Since this, then, has been clearly shown, let all his disciples be put to shame, and let them
wrangle1130 about Adam, as if some great gain were to accrue to them if he be not saved;
when they profit nothing more [by that], even as the serpent also did not profit when persuading
man [to sin], except to this effect, that he proved him a transgressor, obtaining man
as the first-fruits of his own apostasy.1131 But he did not know God’s power.1132 Thus also
do those who disallow Adam’s salvation gain nothing, except this, that they render themselves

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Recapitulation of the various arguments adduced against
Gnostic impiety under all its aspects. The heretics, tossed about by every blast
of doctrine, are opposed by the uniform teaching of the Church, which remains
so always, and is consistent with itself.</head>
<p>1. Thus, then, have all these men been exposed, who bring in impious doctrines regarding
our Maker and Framer, who also formed this world, and above whom there is no other God;
and those have been overthrown by their own arguments who teach falsehoods regarding
the substance of our Lord, and the dispensation which He fulfilled for the sake of His own
creature man. But [it has, on the other hand, been shown], that the preaching of the Church
is everywhere consistent, and continues in an even course, and receives testimony from the
prophets, the apostles, and all the disciples—as I have proved— through [those in] the beginning,
the middle, and the end,1133 and through the entire dispensation of God, and that
well-grounded system which tends1134 to man’s salvation, namely, our faith; which, having
been received from the Church, we do preserve, and which always, by the Spirit of God,
renewing its youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an excellent vessel, causes the
vessel itself containing it to renew its youth also. For this gift of God has been entrusted to
the Church, as breath was to the first created man,1135 for this purpose, that all the members
receiving it may be vivified; and the [means of] communion with Christ has been distributed
throughout it, that is, the Holy Spirit, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming
our faith, and the ladder of ascent to God. “For in the Church,” it is said, “God hath set
apostles, prophets, teachers,”1136 and all the other means through which the Spirit works;
of which all those are not partakers who do not join themselves to the Church, but defraud
themselves of life through their perverse opinions and infamous behaviour. For where the
Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the Church,
and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, who do not partake of Him,
are neither nourished into life from the mother’s breasts, nor do they enjoy that most
limpid fountain which issues from the body of Christ; but they dig for themselves broken
cisterns1137 out of earthly trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the
faith of the Church lest they be convicted; and rejecting the Spirit, that they may not be instructed.</p>
<note type="footnote">1133 Literally, “through the beginnings, the means, and the end.” These three terms refer to the Prophets,
the Apostles, and the Church Catholic.</note>
<note type="footnote">1134 The Latin is “solidam operationem,” which we know not how to translate, in accordance with the context,

<p>2. Alienated thus from the truth, they do deservedly wallow in all error, tossed to and
fro by it, thinking differently in regard to the same things at different times, and never attaining
to a well-grounded knowledge, being more anxious to be sophists of words than
disciples of the truth. For they have not been founded upon the one rock, but upon the sand,
which has in itself a multitude of stones. Wherefore they also imagine many gods, and they
always have the excuse of searching [after truth] (for they are blind), but never succeed in
finding it. For they blaspheme the Creator, Him who is truly God, who also furnishes power
to find [the truth]; imagining that they have discovered another god beyond God, or another
Pleroma, or another dispensation. Wherefore also the light which is from God does not illumine
them, because they have dishonoured and despised God, holding Him of small account,
because, through His love and infinite benignity, He has come within reach of human
knowledge (knowledge, however, not with regard to His greatness, or with regard to His
essence—for that has no man measured or handled—but after this sort: that we should
know that He who made, and formed, and breathed in them the breath of life, and nourishes
us by means of the creation, establishing all things by His Word, and binding them together
by His Wisdom1138— this is He who is the only true God); but they dream of a non-existent
being above Him, that they may be regarded as having found out the great God, whom
nobody, [they hold,] can recognise holding communication with the human race, or as
directing mundane matters: that is to say, they find out the god of Epicurus, who does
nothing either for himself or others; that is, he exercises no providence at all.</p>

<pb n="1153"/>
<head>Chapter XXV.—This world is ruled by the providence of one God, who is both
endowed with infinite justice to punish the wicked, and with infinite goodness
to bless the pious, and impart to them salvation.</head>
<p>1. God does, however, exercise a providence over all things, and therefore He also gives
counsel; and when giving counsel, He is present with those who attend to moral discipline.
1139 It follows then of course, that the things which are watched over and governed
should be acquainted with their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain, but they have
understanding derived from the providence of God. And, for this reason certain of the
Gentiles, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements and voluptuousness, and were not
led away to such a degree of superstition with regard to idols, being moved, though but
slightly, by His providence, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the Maker of
this universe the Father, who exercises a providence over all things, and arranges the affairs
of our world.</p>
<p>2. Again, that they might remove the rebuking and judicial power from the Father,
reckoning that as unworthy of God, and thinking that they had found out a God both without
anger and [merely] good, they have alleged that one [God] judges, but that another saves,
unconsciously taking away the intelligence and justice of both deities. For if the judicial one
is not also good, to bestow favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those
requiring them, he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good
God, if he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send his goodness,
will be out of the range of justice and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as
not saving all; [for it should do so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.</p>
<p>3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by dividing God into two, maintaining one to be good
and the other judicial, does in fact, on both sides, put an end to deity. For he that is the judicial
one, if he be not good, is not God, because he from whom goodness is absent is no
God at all; and again, he who is good, if he has no judicial power, suffers the same [loss] as
the former, by being deprived of his character of deity. And how can they call the Father of
all wise, if they do not assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is also one who
tests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests, and justice follows the judicial
faculty, that it may reach a just conclusion; justice calls forth judgment, and judgment, when
it is executed with justice, will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father will excel in wisdom
all human and angelic wisdom, because He is Lord, and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler
over all. For He is good, and merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does
goodness desert Him in the exercise of justice,1140 nor is His wisdom lessened; for He saves
<note type="footnote">1139 Literally, “who have a foresight of morals” —qui morum providentiam habent. The meaning is very obscure.

<note type="footnote">1140 The text is here very uncertain, but the above seems the probable meaning.</note>

<pb n="1154"/>
those whom He should save, and judges those worthy of judgment. Neither does He show
Himself unmercifully just; for His goodness, no doubt, goes on before, and takes precedency.</p>
<p>4. The God, therefore, who does benevolently cause His sun to rise upon all,1141 and
sends rain upon the just and unjust, shall judge those who, enjoying His equally distributed
kindness, have led lives not corresponding to the dignity of His bounty; but who have spent
their days in wantonness and luxury, in opposition to His benevolence, and have, moreover,
even blasphemed Him who has conferred so great benefits upon them.</p>
<p>5. Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God
was both just and good, having power over all things, and Himself executing judgment, expressing
himself thus, “And God indeed, as He is also the ancient Word, possessing the beginning,
the end, and the mean of all existing things, does everything rightly, moving round
about them according to their nature; but retributive justice always follows Him against
those who depart from the divine law.”1142 Then, again, he points out that the Maker and
Framer of the universe is good. “And to the good,” he says, “no envy ever springs up with
regard to anything;”1143 thus establishing the goodness of God, as the beginning and the
cause of the creation of the world, but not ignorance, nor an erring Æon, nor the consequence
of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and lamenting, nor another God or Father.</p>
<p>6. Well may their Mother bewail them, as capable of conceiving and inventing such
things for they have worthily uttered this falsehood against themselves, that their Mother
is beyond the Pleroma, that is beyond the knowledge of God, and that their entire multitude
became1144 a shapeless and crude abortion: for it apprehends nothing of the truth; it falls
into void and darkness: for their wisdom (Sophia) was void, and wrapped up in darkness;
and Horos did not permit her to enter the Pleroma: for the Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive
them into the place of refreshment. For their father, by begetting ignorance, wrought in
them the sufferings of death. We do not misrepresent [their opinions on] these points; but
they do themselves confirm, they do themselves teach, they do glory in them, they imagine
a lofty [mystery] about their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten without
a father, that is, without God, a female from a female,1145 that is, corruption from error.</p>
<p>7. We do indeed pray that these men may not remain in the pit which they themselves
have dug, but separate themselves from a Mother of this nature, and depart from Bythus,

has been already stated, I have deferred to the following book, to adduce the words of the

<head>Elucidation</head>
<p>The editor of this American Series confines himself in general to such occasional and
very brief annotations as may suggest to students and others the practical views which are
requisite to a clear comprehension of authors who wrote for past ages; for a sort and condition
of men no longer existing, whose extinction as a class is, indeed, largely due to these writings.
But he reserved to himself the privilege of correcting palpable mistakes, especially in points
which bear upon questions of our own times.</p>
<p>That our learned translators have unaccountably admitted a very inaccurate translation
of the crucial paragraph in book iii. cap. iii. sect. 2, I have shown in the footnote at that place.
It is evident, (1) because they themselves are not satisfied with it, and (2) because I have set
it side by side with the more literal rendering of a writer who would have preferred their
reading if it could have borne the test of criticism.</p>
<p>Now, the authors of the Latin translation1146 may have designed the ambiguity which
gives the Ultramontane party an apparent advantage; but it is an advantage which disappears
as soon as it is examined, and hence I am content to take it as it stands. Various conjectures
have been made as to the original Greek of Irenæus; but the Latin answers every purpose
of the author’s argument, and is fatal to the claims of the Papacy. Let me recur to the translation
given, in loco, from a Roman Catholic, and this will be seen at once.</p>
<p>For he thus renders it:—</p>
<p>1. In this Church, “ever, by those who are on every side, has been preserved that tradition
which is from apostles.” How would such a proposition have sounded to Pius IX. in the
Vatican Council? The faith is preserved by those who come to Rome, not by the Bishop who
presides there.</p>
<p>2. “For to this Church, on account of more potent principality,1147 it is necessary that
every Church (that is, those who are, on every side, faithful) resort.” The greatness of Rome,
that is, as the capital of the Empire, imparts to the local Church a superior dignity, even as
compared with Lyons, or any other metropolitical Church. Everybody visits Rome: hence
you find there faithful witnesses from every side (from all the Churches); and their united
testimony it is which preserves in Rome the pure apostolic traditions.</p>
<p>The Latin, thus translated by a candid Roman Catholic, reverses the whole system of
the Papacy. Pius IX. informed his Bishops, at the late Council, that they were not called to
<note type="footnote">1146 One of the Antiochian Canons probably reflects the current language of an earlier antiquity thus: διὰ
τὸ ἐν τῇ μητροπόλει πανταχόθεν συντρέχειν πάντας τοὺς τὰ πράγματα ἔχοντας: and, if so, this συντρέχειν
gives the meaning of convenire.</note>
<note type="footnote">1147 “Its more potent,” etc., is not a strict rendering: “the more potent,” rather; which leaves the principalitas
to the city, not the Church.</note>

<pb n="1157"/>
bear their testimony, but to hear his infallible decree; “reducing us,” said the Archbishop of
Paris, “to a council of sacristans.”</p>
<p>Sustaining these views by a few footnotes, I add (1) a literal rendering of my own, and
then (2) a metaphrase of the same, bringing out the argument from the crabbed obstructions
of the Latin text. This, then, is what Irenæus says: (a) “For it is necessary for every Church
(that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet in this Church, on account of the superior
magistracy; in which Church, by those who are from all places, the tradition of the apostles
has been preserved.” Or, more freely rendered: (b) “On account of the chief magistracy1148
[of the empire], the faithful from all parts, representing every Church, are obliged to resort
to Rome, and there to come together; so that [it is the distinction of this Church that], in it,
the tradition of the apostles has been preserved by Christians gathered together out of all
the Churches.” Taking the entire argument of our author with the context, then, it amounts
to this: “We must ask, not for local, but universal, testimony. Now, in every Church founded
by the apostles has been handed down their traditions; but, as it would be a tedious thing
to collect them all, let this suffice. Take that Church (nearest at hand, and which is the only
Apostolic Church of the West), the great and glorious Church at Rome, which was there
founded by the two apostles Peter and Paul. In her have been preserved the traditions of all
the Churches, because everybody is forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these
representatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions have been all collected
in Rome:1149 and you have a synoptical view of all Churches in what is there preserved.”
Had the views of the modern Papacy ever entered the head of Irenæus, what an absurdity
would be this whole argument. He would have said, “It is no matter what may be gathered
elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is the infallible oracle of all Catholic truth, and you will
always find it by his mouth.” It should be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed preserved there,
just so long as Rome permitted other Churches to contribute their testimony on the principle
of Irenæus, and thus to make her the depository of all Catholic tradition, as witnessed “by
all, everywhere, and from the beginning.” But all this is turned upside down by modern
Romanism. No other Church is to be heard or considered; but Rome takes all into her own
power, and may dictate to all Churches what they are to believe, however novel, or contrary
<note type="footnote">1148 Bishop Wordsworth inclines to the idea that the original Greek was ἱκανωτέραν ἀρχαιότητα, thus
conceding that Irenæus was speaking of the greater antiquity of Rome as compared with other (Western)
Churches. Even so, he shows that the argument of Irenæus is fatal to Roman pretensions, which admit of no
such ideas as he advances, and no such freedom as that of his dealings with Rome.</note>
<note type="footnote">1149 Nobody has more forcibly stated the argument of Irenæus than the Abbé Guettée, in his exhaustive
work on the Papacy. I published a translation of this valuable historical epitome in New York (Carleton), 1867;

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>1. By transmitting to thee, my very dear friend, this fourth book of the work which is
[entitled] The Detection and Refutation of False Knowledge, I shall, as I have promised, add
weight, by means of the words of the Lord, to what I have already advanced; so that thou
also, as thou hast requested, mayest obtain from me the means of confuting all the heretics
everywhere, and not permit them, beaten back at all points, to launch out further into the
deep of error, nor to be drowned in the sea of ignorance; but that thou, turning them into
the haven of the truth, mayest cause them to attain their salvation.</p>
<p>2. The man, however, who would undertake their conversion, must possess an accurate
knowledge of their systems or schemes of doctrine. For it is impossible for any one to heal
the sick, if he has no knowledge of the disease of the patients. This was the reason that my
predecessors—much superior men to myself, too —were unable, notwithstanding, to refute
the Valentinians satisfactorily, because they were ignorant of these men’s system;1150 which
I have with all care delivered to thee in the first book in which I have also shown that their
doctrine is a recapitulation of all the heretics. For which reason also, in the second, we have
had, as in a mirror, a sight of their entire discomfiture. For they who oppose these men (the
Valentinians) by the right method, do [thereby] oppose all who are of an evil mind; and
they who overthrow them, do in fact overthrow every kind of heresy.</p>
<p>3. For their system is blasphemous above all [others], since they represent that the Maker
and Framer, who is one God, as I have shown, was produced from a defect or apostasy. They
utter blasphemy, also, against our Lord, by cutting off and dividing Jesus from Christ, and
Christ from the Saviour, and again the Saviour from the Word, and the Word from the
Only-begotten. And since they allege that the Creator originated from a defect or apostasy,
so have they also taught that Christ and the Holy Spirit were emitted on account of this defect,
and that the Saviour was a product of those Æons who were produced from a defect; so that
there is nothing but blasphemy to be found among them. In the preceding book, then, the
ideas of the apostles as to all these points have been set forth, [to the effect] that not only
did they, “who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word”1151 of
truth, hold no such opinions, but that they did also preach to us to shun these doctrines,1152
foreseeing by the Spirit those weak-minded persons who should be led astray.1153</p>

<p>4. For as the serpent beguiled Eve, by promising her what he had not himself,1154 so
also do these men, by pretending [to possess] superior knowledge, and [to be acquainted
with] ineffable mysteries; and, by promising that admittance which they speak of as taking
place within the Pleroma, plunge those that believe them into death, rendering them apostates
from Him who made them. And at that time, indeed, the apostate angel, having effected
the disobedience of mankind by means of the serpent, imagined that he escaped the notice
of the Lord; wherefore God assigned him the form1155 and name [of a serpent]. But now,
since the last times are [come upon us], evil is spread abroad among men, which not only
renders them apostates, but by many machinations does [the devil] raise up blasphemers
against the Creator, namely, by means of all the heretics already mentioned. For all these,
although they issue forth from diverse regions, and promulgate different [opinions], do
nevertheless concur in the same blasphemous design, wounding [men] unto death, by
teaching blasphemy against God our Maker and Supporter, and derogating from the salvation
of man. Now man is a mixed organization of soul and flesh, who was formed after the likeness
of God, and moulded by His hands, that is, by the Son and Holy Spirit, to whom also He
said, “Let Us make man.”1156 This, then, is the aim of him who envies our life, to render
men disbelievers in their own salvation, and blasphemous against God the Creator. For
whatsoever all the heretics may have advanced with the utmost solemnity, they come to this
at last, that they blaspheme the Creator, and disallow the salvation of God’s workmanship,
which the flesh truly is; on behalf of which I have proved, in a variety of ways, that the Son
of God accomplished the whole dispensation [of mercy], and have shown that there is none
other called God by the Scriptures except the Father of all, and the Son, and those who
possess the adoption.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The Lord acknowledged but one God and Father.</head>
<p>1. Since, therefore, this is sure and stedfast, that no other God or Lord was announced
by the Spirit, except Him who, as God, rules over all, together with His Word, and those
who receive the Spirit of adoption,1157 that is, those who believe in the one and true God,
and in Jesus Christ the Son of God; and likewise that the apostles did of themselves term no
one else as God, or name [no other] as Lord; and, what is much more important, [since it
is true] that our Lord [acted likewise], who did also command us to confess no one as
Father, except Him who is in the heavens, who is the one God and the one Father;—those
things are clearly shown to be false which these deceivers and most perverse sophists advance,
maintaining that the being whom they have themselves invented is by nature both God and
Father; but that the Demiurge is naturally neither God nor Father, but is so termed merely
by courtesy (verbo tenus), because of his ruling the creation, these perverse mythologists
state, setting their thoughts against God; and, putting aside the doctrine of Christ, and of
themselves divining falsehoods, they dispute against the entire dispensation of God. For
they maintain that their Æons, and gods, and fathers, and lords, are also still further termed
heavens, together with their Mother, whom they do also call “the Earth,” and “Jerusalem,”
while they also style her many other names.</p>
<p>2. Now to whom is it not clear, that if the Lord had known many fathers and gods, He
would not have taught His disciples to know [only] one God,1158 and to call Him alone
Father? But He did the rather distinguish those who by word merely (verbo tenus) are termed
gods, from Him who is truly God, that they should not err as to His doctrine, nor understand
one [in mistake] for another. And if He did indeed teach us to call one Being Father and
God, while He does from time to time Himself confess other fathers and gods in the same
sense, then He will appear to enjoin a different course upon His disciples from what He
follows Himself. Such conduct, however, does not bespeak the good teacher, but a misleading
and invidious one. The apostles, too, according to these men’s showing, are proved to be
transgressors of the commandment, since they confess the Creator as God, and Lord, and
Father, as I have shown—if He is not alone God and Father. Jesus, therefore, will be to them
the author and teacher of such transgression, inasmuch as He commanded that one Being
should be called Father,1159 thus imposing upon them the necessity of confessing the Creator
as their Father, as has been pointed out.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Proofs from the plain testimony of Moses, and of the other prophets,
whose words are the words of Christ, that there is but one God, the founder of
the world, whom Our Lord preached, and whom He called His Father.</head>
<p>1. Moses, therefore, making a recapitulation of the whole law, which he had received
from the Creator (Demiurge), thus speaks in Deuteronomy: “Give ear, O ye heavens, and I
will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.”1160 Again, David saying that his
help came from the Lord, asserts: “My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and
earth.”1161 And Esaias confesses that words were uttered by God, who made heaven and
earth, and governs them. He says: “Hear, O heavens; and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath
spoken.”1162 And again: “Thus saith the Lord God, who made the heaven, and stretched it
out; who established the earth, and the things in it; and who giveth breath to the people
upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein.”1163</p>
<p>2. Again, our Lord Jesus Christ confesses this same Being as His Father, where He says:
“I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.”1164 What Father will those men
have us to understand [by these words], those who are most perverse sophists of Pandora?
Whether shall it be Bythus, whom they have fabled of themselves; or their Mother; or the
Only-begotten? Or shall it be he whom the Marcionites or the others have invented as god
(whom I indeed have amply demonstrated to be no god at all); or shall it be (what is really
the case) the Maker of heaven and earth, whom also the prophets proclaimed,—whom
Christ, too, confesses as His Father,— whom also the law announces, saying: “Hear, O Israel;
The Lord thy God is one God?”1165</p>
<p>3. But since the writings (literæ) of Moses are the words of Christ, He does Himself declare
to the Jews, as John has recorded in the Gospel: “If ye had believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me: for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, neither will ye believe
My words.”1166 He thus indicates in the clearest manner that the writings of Moses are His
words. If, then, [this be the case with regard] to Moses, so also, beyond a doubt, the words
of the other prophets are His [words], as I have pointed out. And again, the Lord Himself
exhibits Abraham as having said to the rich man, with reference to all those who were still
alive: “If they do not obey Moses and the prophets, neither, if any one were to rise from the
dead and go to them, will they believe him.”1167</p>

<p>4. Now, He has not merely related to us a story respecting a poor man and a rich one;
but He has taught us, in the first place, that no one should lead a luxurious life, nor, living
in worldly pleasures and perpetual feastings, should be the slave of his lusts, and forget God.
“For there was,” He says, “a rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and delighted
himself with splendid feasts.”1168</p>
<p>5. Of such persons, too, the Spirit has spoken by Esaias: “They drink wine with [the accompaniment
of] harps, and tablets, and psalteries, and flutes; but they regard not the works
of God, neither do they consider the work of His hands.”1169 Lest, therefore, we should incur
the same punishment as these men, the Lord reveals [to us] their end; showing at the same
time, that if they obeyed Moses and the prophets, they would believe in Him whom these
had preached, the Son of God, who rose from the dead, and bestows life upon us; and He
shows that all are from one essence, that is, Abraham, and Moses, and the prophets, and
also the Lord Himself, who rose from the dead, in whom many believe who are of the circumcision,
who do also hear Moses and the prophets announcing the coming of the Son of
God. But those who scoff [at the truth] assert that these men were from another essence,
and they do not know the first-begotten from the dead; understanding Christ as a distinct
being, who continued as if He were impassible, and Jesus, who suffered, as being altogether
separate [from Him].</p>
<p>6. For they do not receive from the Father the knowledge of the Son; neither do they
learn who the Father is from the Son, who teaches clearly and without parables Him who
truly is God. He says: “Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the
earth, for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.”1170
For these words are evidently spoken with reference to the Creator, as also Esaias says:
“Heaven is my throne, the earth is my footstool.”1171 And besides this Being there is no
other God; otherwise He would not be termed by the Lord either “God” or “the great King;”
for a Being who can be so described admits neither of any other being compared with nor
set above Him. For he who has any superior over him, and is under the power of another,
this being never can be called either “God” or “the great King.”</p>
<p>7. But neither will these men be able to maintain that such words were uttered in an
ironical manner, since it is proved to them by the words themselves that they were in earnest.
For He who uttered them was Truth, and did truly vindicate His own house, by driving out
of it the changers of money, who were buying and selling, saying unto them: “It is written,
My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.”1172 And

<pb n="1165"/>
what reason had He for thus doing and saying, and vindicating His house, if He did preach
another God? But [He did so], that He might point out the transgressors of His Father’s
law; for neither did He bring any accusation against the house, nor did He blame the law,
which He had come to fulfil; but He reproved those who were putting His house to an improper
use, and those who were transgressing the law. And therefore the scribes and Pharisees,
too, who from the times of the law had begun to despise God, did not receive His
Word, that is, they did not believe on Christ. Of these Esaias says: “Thy princes are rebellious,
companions of thieves, loving gifts, following after rewards, not judging the fatherless, and
negligent of the cause of the widows.”1173 And Jeremiah, in like manner: “They,” he says,
“who rule my people did not know me; they are senseless and imprudent children; they are
wise to do evil, but to do well they have no knowledge.”1174</p>
<p>8. But as many as feared God, and were anxious about His law, these ran to Christ, and
were all saved. For He said to His disciples: “Go ye to the sheep of the house of Israel,1175
which have perished.” And many more Samaritans, it is said, when the Lord had tarried
among them, two days, “believed because of His words, and said to the woman, Now we
believe, not because of thy saying, for we ourselves have heard [Him], and know that this
man is truly the Saviour of the world.”1176 And Paul likewise declares, “And so all Israel
shall be saved;”1177 but he has also said, that the law was our pedagogue [to bring us] to
Christ Jesus.1178 Let them not therefore ascribe to the law the unbelief of certain [among
them]. For the law never hindered them from believing in the Son of God; nay, but it even
exhorted them1179 so to do, saying1180 that men can be saved in no other way from the old
wound of the serpent than by believing in Him who, in the likeness of sinful flesh, is lifted
up from the earth upon the tree of martyrdom, and draws all things to Himself,1181 and
vivifies the dead.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Answer to the cavils of the Gnostics. We are not to suppose that
the true God can be changed, or come to an end because the heavens, which are
His throne and the earth, His footstool, shall pass away.</head>
<p>1. Again, as to their malignantly asserting that if heaven is indeed the throne of God,
and earth His footstool, and if it is declared that the heaven and earth shall pass away, then
when these pass away the God who sitteth above must also pass away, and therefore He
cannot be the God who is over all; in the first place, they are ignorant what the expression
means, that heaven is [His] throne and earth [His] footstool. For they do not know what
God is, but they imagine that He sits after the fashion of a man, and is contained within
bounds, but does not contain. And they are also unacquainted with [the meaning of] the
passing away of the heaven and earth; but Paul was not ignorant of it when he declared,
“For the figure of this world passeth away.”1182 In the next place, David explains their
question, for he says that when the fashion of this world passes away, not only shall God
remain, but His servants also, expressing himself thus in the 101st Psalm: “In the beginning,
Thou, O Lord, hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thy hands. They
shall perish, but Thou shalt endure, and all shall wax old as a garment; and as a vesture Thou
shalt change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall
not fail. The children of Thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established for
ever;”1183 pointing out plainly what things they are that pass away, and who it is that doth
endure for ever—God, together with His servants. And in like manner Esaias says: “Lift up
your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heaven has been set together
as smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they who dwell therein
shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not
pass away.”1184</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Answer to another objection, showing that the destruction of
Jerusalem, which was the city of the great King, diminished nothing from the
supreme majesty and power of God, for that this destruction was put in execution
by the most wise counsel of the same God.</head>
<p>1. Further, also, concerning Jerusalem and the Lord, they venture to assert that, if it had
been “the city of the great King,”1185 it would not have been deserted.1186 This is just as if
any one should say, that if straw were a creation of God, it would never part company with
the wheat; and that the vine twigs, if made by God, never would be lopped away and deprived
of the clusters. But as these [vine twigs] have not been originally made for their own sake,
but for that of the fruit growing upon them, which being come to maturity and taken away,
they are left behind, and those which do not conduce to fructification are lopped off altogether;
so also [was it with] Jerusalem, which had in herself borne the yoke of bondage
(under which man was reduced, who in former times was not subject to God when death
was reigning, and being subdued, became a fit subject for liberty), when the fruit of liberty
had come, and reached maturity, and been reaped and stored in the barn, and when those
which had the power to produce fruit had been carried away from her [i.e., from Jerusalem],
and scattered throughout all the world. Even as Esaias saith, “The children of Jacob shall
strike root, and Israel shall flourish, and the whole world shall be filled with his fruit.”1187
The fruit, therefore, having been sown throughout all the world, she (Jerusalem) was deservedly
forsaken, and those things which had formerly brought forth fruit abundantly were
taken away; for from these, according to the flesh, were Christ and the apostles enabled to
bring forth fruit. But now these are no longer useful for bringing forth fruit. For all things
which have a beginning in time must of course have an end in time also.</p>
<p>2. Since, then, the law originated with Moses, it terminated with John as a necessary
consequence. Christ had come to fulfil it: wherefore “the law and the prophets were” with
them “until John.”1188 And therefore Jerusalem, taking its commencement from David,1189
and fulfilling its own times, must have an end of legislation1190 when the new covenant was
revealed. For God does all things by measure and in order; nothing is unmeasured with
Him, because nothing is out of order. Well spake he, who said that the unmeasurable Father

was Himself subjected to measure in the Son; for the Son is the measure of the Father, since
He also comprehends Him. But that the administration of them (the Jews) was temporary,
Esaias says: “And the daughter of Zion shall be left as a cottage in a vineyard, and as a lodge
in a garden of cucumbers.”1191 And when shall these things be left behind? Is it not when
the fruit shall be taken away, and the leaves alone shall be left, which now have no power of
producing fruit?</p>
<p>3. But why do we speak of Jerusalem, since, indeed, the fashion of the whole world must
also pass away, when the time of its disappearance has come, in order that the fruit indeed
may be gathered into the garner, but the chaff, left behind, may be consumed by fire? “For
the day of the Lord cometh as a burning furnace, and all sinners shall be stubble, they who
do evil things, and the day shall burn them up.”1192 Now, who this Lord is that brings such
a day about, John the Baptist points out, when he says of Christ, “He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost and with fire, having His fan in His hand to cleanse His floor; and He will
gather His fruit into the garner, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.”1193
For He who makes the chaff and He who makes the wheat are not different persons, but
one and the same, who judges them, that is, separates them. But the wheat and the chaff,
being inanimate and irrational, have been made such by nature. But man, being endowed
with reason, and in this respect like to God, having been made free in his will, and with
power over himself, is himself the cause to himself, that sometimes he becomes wheat, and
sometimes chaff. Wherefore also he shall be justly condemned, because, having been created
a rational being, he lost the true rationality, and living irrationally, opposed the righteousness
of God, giving himself over to every earthly spirit, and serving all lusts; as says the prophet,
“Man, being in honour, did not understand: he was assimilated to senseless beasts, and made

<head>Chapter V.—The author returns to his former argument, and shows that there
was but one God announced by the law and prophets, whom Christ confesses as
His Father, and who, through His word, one living God with Him, made Himself
known to men in both covenants.</head>
<p>1. God, therefore, is one and the same, who rolls up the heaven as a book, and renews
the face of the earth; who made the things of time for man, so that coming to maturity in
them, he may produce the fruit of immortality; and who, through His kindness, also bestows
[upon him] eternal things, “that in the ages to come He may show the exceeding riches of
His grace;”1195 who was announced by the law and the prophets, whom Christ confessed
as His Father. Now He is the Creator, and He it is who is God over all, as Esaias says, “I am
witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know, and
believe, and understand that I am. Before me there was no other God, neither shall be after
me. I am God, and besides me there is no Saviour. I have proclaimed, and I have saved.”1196
And again: “I myself am the first God, and I am above things to come.”1197 For neither in
an ambiguous, nor arrogant, nor boastful manner, does He say these things; but since it was
impossible, without God, to come to a knowledge of God, He teaches men, through His
Word, to know God. To those, therefore, who are ignorant of these matters, and on this
account imagine that they have discovered another Father, justly does one say, “Ye do err,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.”1198</p>
<p>2. For our Lord and Master, in the answer which He gave to the Sadducees, who say
that there is no resurrection, and who do therefore dishonour God, and lower the credit of
the law, did both indicate a resurrection, and reveal God, saying to them, “Ye do err, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.” “For, touching the resurrection of the dead,”
He says, “have ye not read that which was spoken by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?”1199 And He added, “He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living; for all live to Him.” By these arguments He unquestionably made it clear,
that He who spake to Moses out of the bush, and declared Himself to be the God of the
fathers, He is the God of the living. For who is the God of the living unless He who is God,
and above whom there is no other God? Whom also Daniel the prophet, when Cyrus king
of the Persians said to him, “Why dost thou not worship Bel?”1200 did proclaim, saying,

“Because I do not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who established the
heaven and the earth and has dominion over all flesh.” Again did he say, “I will adore the
Lord my God, because He is the living God.” He, then, who was adored by the prophets as
the living God, He is the God of the living; and His Word is He who also spake to Moses,
who also put the Sadducees to silence, who also bestowed the gift of resurrection, thus revealing
[both] truths to those who are blind, that is, the resurrection and God [in His true
character]. For if He be not the God of the dead, but of the living, yet was called the God of
the fathers who were sleeping, they do indubitably live to God, and have not passed out of
existence, since they are children of the resurrection. But our Lord is Himself the resurrection,
as He does Himself declare, “I am the resurrection and the life.”1201 But the fathers are His
children; for it is said by the prophet: “Instead of thy fathers, thy children have been made
to thee.”1202 Christ Himself, therefore, together with the Father, is the God of the living,
who spake to Moses, and who was also manifested to the fathers.</p>
<p>3. And teaching this very thing, He said to the Jews: “Your father Abraham rejoiced that
he should see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.”1203 What is intended? “Abraham believed
God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.”1204 In the first place, [he believed]
that He was the maker of heaven and earth, the only God; and in the next place, that He
would make his seed as the stars of heaven. This is what is meant by Paul, [when he says,]
“as lights in the world.”1205 Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly kindred, he followed
the Word of God, walking as a pilgrim with the Word, that he might [afterwards] have his
abode with the Word.</p>
<p>4. Righteously also the apostles, being of the race of Abraham, left the ship and their
father, and followed the Word. Righteously also do we, possessing the same faith as Abraham,
and taking up the cross as Isaac did the wood,1206 follow Him. For in Abraham man had
learned beforehand, and had been accustomed to follow the Word of God. For Abraham,
according to his faith, followed the command of the Word of God, and with a ready mind
delivered up, as a sacrifice to God, his only-begotten and beloved son, in order that God
also might be pleased to offer up for all his seed His own beloved and only-begotten Son,
as a sacrifice for our redemption.</p>
<p>5. Since, therefore, Abraham was a prophet and saw in the Spirit the day of the Lord’s
coming, and the dispensation of His suffering, through whom both he himself and all who,

following the example of his faith, trust in God, should be saved, he rejoiced exceedingly.
The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham, whose day he desired to see;1207 nor,
again, was the Lord’s Father, for he had learned from the Word of the Lord, and believed
Him; wherefore it was accounted to him by the Lord for righteousness. For faith towards
God justifies a man; and therefore he said, “I will stretch forth my hand to the most high
God, who made the heaven and the earth.”1208 All these truths, however, do those holding
perverse opinions endeavour to overthrow, because of one passage, which they certainly do
not understand correctly.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Explanation of the words of Christ, “No man knoweth the Father,
but the Son,” etc.; which words the heretics misinterpret. Proof that, by the
Father revealing the Son, and by the Son being revealed, the Father was never
unknown.</head>
<p>1. For the Lord, revealing Himself to His disciples, that He Himself is the Word, who
imparts knowledge of the Father, and reproving the Jews, who imagined that they, had [the
knowledge of] God, while they nevertheless rejected His Word, through whom God is made
known, declared, “No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son has willed to reveal [Him].”1209 Thus hath
Matthew set it down, and Luke in like manner, and Mark1210 the very same; for John omits
this passage. They, however, who would be wiser than the apostles, write [the verse] in the
following manner: “No man knew the Father, but the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and
he to whom the Son has willed to reveal [Him];” and they explain it as if the true God were
known to none prior to our Lord’s advent; and that God who was announced by the
prophets, they allege not to be the Father of Christ.</p>
<p>2. But if Christ did then [only] begin to have existence when He came [into the world]
as man, and [if] the Father did remember [only] in the times of Tiberius Cæsar to provide
for [the wants of] men, and His Word was shown to have not always coexisted with His
creatures; [it may be remarked that] neither then was it necessary that another God should
be proclaimed, but [rather] that the reasons for so great carelessness and neglect on His part
should be made the subject of investigation. For it is fitting that no such question should
arise, and gather such strength, that it would indeed both change God, and destroy our faith
in that Creator who supports us by means of His creation. For as we do direct our faith towards
the Son, so also should we possess a firm and immoveable love towards the Father.
In his book against Marcion, Justin1211 does well say: “I would not have believed the Lord
Himself, if He had announced any other than He who is our framer, maker, and nourisher.
But because the only-begotten Son came to us from the one God, who both made this world
and formed us, and contains and administers all things, summing up His own handiwork
in Himself, my faith towards Him is stedfast, and my love to the Father immoveable, God
bestowing both upon us.”</p>

remark is that it hinges on the words of Christ Himself, concerning His antecedents and notes as set forth in
the Scriptures, St. John v. 30–39.]</note>

<pb n="1173"/>
<p>3. For no one can know the Father, unless through the Word of God, that is, unless by
the Son revealing [Him]; neither can he have knowledge of the Son, unless through the good
pleasure of the Father. But the Son performs the good pleasure of the Father; for the Father
sends, and the Son is sent, and comes. And His Word knows that His Father is, as far as regards
us, invisible and infinite; and since He cannot be declared [by any one else], He does
Himself declare Him to us; and, on the other hand, it is the Father alone who knows His
own Word. And both these truths has our Lord declared. Wherefore the Son reveals the
knowledge of the Father through His own manifestation. For the manifestation of the Son
is the knowledge of the Father; for all things are manifested through the Word. In order,
therefore, that we might know that the Son who came is He who imparts to those believing
on Him a knowledge of the Father, He said to His disciples:1212 “No man knoweth the Son
but the Father, nor the Father but the Son, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal
Him;” thus setting Himself forth and the Father as He [really] is, that we may not receive
any other Father, except Him who is revealed by the Son.</p>
<p>4. But this [Father] is the Maker of heaven and earth, as is shown from His words; and
not he, the false father, who has been invented by Marcion, or by Valentinus, or by Basilides,
or by Carpocrates, or by Simon, or by the rest of the “Gnostics,” falsely so called. For none
of these was the Son of God; but Christ Jesus our Lord [was], against whom they set their
teaching in opposition, and have the daring to preach an unknown God. But they ought to
hear [this] against themselves: How is it that He is unknown, who is known by them? for,
whatever is known even by a few, is not unknown. But the Lord did not say that both the
Father and the Son could not be known at all (in totum), for in that case His advent would
have been superfluous. For why did He come hither? Was it that He should say to us,
“Never mind seeking after God; for He is unknown, and ye shall not find Him;” as also the
disciples of Valentinus falsely declare that Christ said to their Æons? But this is indeed vain.
For the Lord taught us that no man is capable of knowing God, unless he be taught of God;
that is, that God cannot be known without God: but that this is the express will of the
Father, that God should be known. For they shall know1213 Him to whomsoever the Son
has revealed Him.</p>
<p>5. And for this purpose did the Father reveal the Son, that through His instrumentality
He might be manifested to all, and might receive those righteous ones who believe in Him
into incorruption and everlasting enjoyment (now, to believe in Him is to do His will); but
He shall righteously shut out into the darkness which they have chosen for themselves, those
who do not believe, and who do consequently avoid His light. The Father therefore has re-

<pb n="1174"/>
vealed Himself to all, by making His Word visible to all; and, conversely, the Word has declared
to all the Father and the Son, since He has become visible to all. And therefore the
righteous judgment of God [shall fall] upon all who, like others, have seen, but have not,
like others, believed.</p>
<p>6. For by means of the creation itself, the Word reveals God the Creator; and by means
of the world [does He declare] the Lord the Maker of the world; and by means of the formation
[of man] the Artificer who formed him; and by the Son that Father who begat the Son:
and these things do indeed address all men in the same manner, but all do not in the same
way believe them. But by the law and the prophets did the Word preach both Himself and
the Father alike [to all]; and all the people heard Him alike, but all did not alike believe. And
through the Word Himself who had been made visible and palpable, was the Father shown
forth, although all did not equally believe in Him; but all saw the Father in the Son: for the
Father is the invisible of the Son, but the Son the visible of the Father. And for this reason
all spake with Christ when He was present [upon earth], and they named Him God. Yea,
even the demons exclaimed, on beholding the Son: “We know Thee who Thou art, the Holy
One of God.”1214 And the devil looking at Him, and tempting Him, said: “If Thou art the
Son of God;”1215—all thus indeed seeing and speaking of the Son and the Father, but all not
believing [in them].</p>
<p>7. For it was fitting that the truth should receive testimony from all, and should become
[a means of] judgment for the salvation indeed of those who believe, but for the condemnation
of those who believe not; that all should be fairly judged, and that the faith in the
Father and Son should be approved by all, that is, that it should be established by all [as the
one means of salvation], receiving testimony from all, both from those belonging to it, since
they are its friends, and by those having no connection with it, though they are its enemies.
For that evidence is true, and cannot be gainsaid, which elicits even from its adversaries
striking1216 testimonies in its behalf; they being convinced with respect to the matter in
hand by their own plain contemplation of it, and bearing testimony to it, as well as declaring
it.1217 But after a while they break forth into enmity, and become accusers [of what they
had approved], and are desirous that their own testimony should not be [regarded as] true.
He, therefore, who was known, was not a different being from Him who declared “No man
knoweth the Father,” but one and the same, the Father making all things subject to Him;
while He received testimony from all that He was very man, and that He was very God, from
the Father, from the Spirit, from angels, from the creation itself, from men, from apostate

spirits and demons, from the enemy, and last of all, from death itself. But the Son, administering
all things for the Father, works from the beginning even to the end, and without Him
no man can attain the knowledge of God. For the Son is the knowledge of the Father; but
the knowledge of the Son is in the Father, and has been revealed through the Son; and this
was the reason why the Lord declared: “No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the
Father, save the Son, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal [Him].”1218 For “shall
reveal” was said not with reference to the future alone, as if then [only] the Word had begun
to manifest the Father when He was born of Mary, but it applies indifferently throughout
all time. For the Son, being present with His own handiwork from the beginning, reveals
the Father to all; to whom He wills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills. Wherefore,
then, in all things, and through all things, there is one God, the Father, and one Word, and
one Son, and one Spirit, and one salvation to all who believe in Him.</p>
<note type="footnote">1218 Matt. xi. 27; Luke x. 22. Harvey observes here, that “it is remarkable that this text, having been correctly
quoted a short time previously in accordance with the received Greek text, ᾧ ἐὰν βούλητας ὁ υἱὸς ἀποκαλύψαι,
the translator now not only uses the single verb revelaverit, but says pointedly that it was so written by the venerable
author.” It is probable, therefore, that the previous passage has been made to harmonize with the received
text by a later hand; with which, however, the Syriac form agrees.</note>

<head>Chapter VII.—Recapitulation of the foregoing argument, showing that Abraham,
through the revelation of the Word, knew the Father, and the coming of the Son
of God. For this cause, he rejoiced to see the day of Christ, when the promises
made to him should be fulfilled. The fruit of this rejoicing has flowed to posterity,
viz., to those who are partakers in the faith of Abraham, but not to the Jews who
reject the Word of God.</head>
<p>1. Therefore Abraham also, knowing the Father through the Word, who made heaven
and earth, confessed Him to be God; and having learned, by an announcement [made to
him], that the Son of God would be a man among men, by whose advent his seed should
be as the stars of heaven, he desired to see that day, so that he might himself also embrace
Christ; and, seeing it through the spirit of prophecy, he rejoiced.1219 Wherefore Simeon
also, one of his descendants, carried fully out the rejoicing of the patriarch, and said: “Lord,
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace. For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which
Thou hast prepared before the face of all people: a light for the revelation of the Gentiles,1220
and the glory of the people Israel.”1221 And the angels, in like manner, announced tidings
of great joy to the shepherds who were keeping watch by night.1222 Moreover, Mary said,
“My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my salvation;”1223—the
rejoicing of Abraham descending upon those who sprang from him,—those, namely, who
were watching, and who beheld Christ, and believed in Him; while, on the other hand, there
was a reciprocal rejoicing which passed backwards from the children to Abraham, who did
also desire to see the day of Christ’s coming. Rightly, then, did our Lord bear witness to
him, saying, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.”</p>
<p>2. For not alone upon Abraham’s account did He say these things, but also that He
might point out how all who have known God from the beginning, and have foretold the
advent of Christ, have received the revelation from the Son Himself; who also in the last
times was made visible and passible, and spake with the human race, that He might from
the stones raise up children unto Abraham, and fulfil the promise which God had given
him, and that He might make his seed as the stars of heaven,1224 as John the Baptist says:
“For God is able from these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.”1225 Now, this Jesus
did by drawing us off from the religion of stones, and bringing us over from hard and

fruitless cogitations, and establishing in us a faith like to Abraham. As Paul does also testify,
saying that we are children of Abraham because of the similarity of our faith, and the
promise of inheritance.1226</p>
<p>3. He is therefore one and the same God, who called Abraham and gave him the
promise. But He is the Creator, who does also through Christ prepare lights in the world,
[namely] those who believe from among the Gentiles. And He says, “Ye are the light of the
world;”1227 that is, as the stars of heaven. Him, therefore, I have rightly shown to be known
by no man, unless by the Son, and to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him. But the Son
reveals the Father to all to whom He wills that He should be known; and neither without
the goodwill of the Father nor without the agency of the Son, can any man know God.
Wherefore did the Lord say to His disciples, “I am the way, the truth, and the life and no
man cometh unto the Father but by Me. If ye had known Me, ye would have known My
Father also: and from henceforth ye have both known Him, and have seen Him.”1228 From
these words it is evident, that He is known by the Son, that is, by the Word.</p>
<p>4. Therefore have the Jews departed from God, in not receiving His Word, but imagining
that they could know the Father [apart] by Himself, without the Word, that is, without the
Son; they being ignorant of that God who spake in human shape to Abraham,1229 and again
to Moses, saying, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have come
down to deliver them.”1230 For the Son, who is the Word of God, arranged these things
beforehand from the beginning, the Father being in no want of angels, in order that He
might call the creation into being, and form man, for whom also the creation was made;
nor, again, standing in need of any instrumentality for the framing of created things, or for
the ordering of those things which had reference to man; while, [at the same time,] He has
a vast and unspeakable number of servants. For His offspring and His similitude1231 do
minister to Him in every respect; that is, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Word and Wisdom;
whom all the angels serve, and to whom they are subject. Vain, therefore, are those who,
because of that declaration, “No man knoweth the Father, but the Son,”1232 do introduce
another unknown Father.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Vain attempts of Marcion and his followers, who exclude
Abraham from the salvation bestowed by Christ, who liberated not only Abraham,
but the seed of Abraham, by fulfilling and not destroying the law when He healed
on the Sabbath-day.</head>
<p>1. Vain, too, is [the effort of] Marcion and his followers when they [seek to] exclude
Abraham from the inheritance, to whom the Spirit through many men, and now by Paul,
bears witness, that “he believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.”1233
And the Lord [also bears witness to him,] in the first place, indeed, by raising up children
to him from the stones, and making his seed as the stars of heaven, saying, “They shall come
from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and shall recline with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;”1234 and then again by saying to
the Jews, “When ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the
kingdom of heaven, but you yourselves cast out.”1235 This, then, is a clear point, that those
who disallow his salvation, and frame the idea of another God besides Him who made the
promise to Abraham, are outside the kingdom of God, and are disinherited from [the gift
of] incorruption, setting at naught and blaspheming God, who introduces, through Jesus
Christ, Abraham to the kingdom of heaven, and his seed, that is, the Church, upon which
also is conferred the adoption and the inheritance promised to Abraham.</p>
<p>2. For the Lord vindicated Abraham’s posterity by loosing them from bondage and
calling them to salvation, as He did in the case of the woman whom He healed, saying openly
to those who had not faith like Abraham, “Ye hypocrites,1236 doth not each one of you on
the Sabbath-days loose his ox or his ass, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound these eighteen years, be
loosed from this bond on the Sabbath-days?”1237 It is clear therefore, that He loosed and
vivified those who believe in Him as Abraham did, doing nothing contrary to the law when
He healed upon the Sabbath-day. For the law did not prohibit men from being healed upon
the Sabbaths; [on the contrary,] it even circumcised them upon that day, and gave command
that the offices should be performed by the priests for the people; yea, it did not disallow
the healing even of dumb animals. Both at Siloam and on frequent subsequent1238 occasions,
did He perform cures upon the Sabbath; and for this reason many used to resort to Him on
the Sabbath-days. For the law commanded them to abstain from every servile work, that is,

from all grasping after wealth which is procured by trading and by other worldly business;
but it exhorted them to attend to the exercises of the soul, which consist in reflection, and
to addresses of a beneficial kind for their neighbours’ benefit. And therefore the Lord reproved
those who unjustly blamed Him for having healed upon the Sabbath-days. For He
did not make void, but fulfilled the law, by performing the offices of the high priest, propitiating
God for men, and cleansing the lepers, healing the sick, and Himself suffering death,
that exiled man might go forth from condemnation, and might return without fear to his
own inheritance.</p>
<p>3. And again, the law did not forbid those who were hungry on the Sabbath-days to take
food lying ready at hand: it did, however, forbid them to reap and to gather into the barn.
And therefore did the Lord say to those who were blaming His disciples because they plucked
and ate the ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands, “Have ye not read this, what David
did, when himself was an hungered; how he went into the house of God, and ate the shewbread,
and gave to those who were with him; which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests
alone?”1239 justifying His disciples by the words of the law, and pointing out that it was
lawful for the priests to act freely. For David had been appointed a priest by God, although
Saul persecuted him. For all the righteous possess the sacerdotal rank.1240 And all the apostles
of the Lord are priests, who do inherit here neither lands nor houses, but serve God and the
altar continually. Of whom Moses also says in Deuteronomy, when blessing Levi, “Who
said unto his father and to his mother, I have not known thee; neither did he acknowledge
his brethren, and he disinherited his own sons: he kept Thy commandments, and observed
Thy covenant.”1241 But who are they that have left father and mother, and have said adieu
to all their neighbours, on account of the word of God and His covenant, unless the disciples
of the Lord? Of whom again Moses says, “They shall have no inheritance, for the Lord
Himself is their inheritance.”1242 And again, “The priests the Levites shall have no part in
the whole tribe of Levi, nor substance with Israel; their substance is the offerings (fructifications)
of the Lord: these shall they eat.”1243 Wherefore also Paul says, “I do not seek after a
gift, but I seek after fruit.”1244 To His disciples He said, who had a priesthood of the Lord,1245

<head>Chapter IX.—There is but one author, and one end to both covenants.</head>
<p>1. All things therefore are of one and the same substance, that is, from one and the same
God; as also the Lord says to the disciples “Therefore every scribe, which is instructed unto
the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out
of his treasure things new and old.”1251 He did not teach that he who brought forth the old
was one, and he that brought forth the new, another; but that they were one and the same.
For the Lord is the good man of the house, who rules the entire house of His Father; and
who delivers a law suited both for slaves and those who are as yet undisciplined; and gives
fitting precepts to those that are free, and have been justified by faith, as well as throws His
own inheritance open to those that are sons. And He called His disciples “scribes” and
“teachers of the kingdom of heaven;” of whom also He elsewhere says to the Jews: “Behold,
I send unto you wise men, and scribes, and teachers; and some of them ye shall kill, and
persecute from city to city.”1252 Now, without contradiction, He means by those things
which are brought forth from the treasure new and old, the two covenants; the old, that
giving of the law which took place formerly; and He points out as the new, that manner of
life required by the Gospel, of which David says, “Sing unto the Lord a new song;”1253 and
Esaias, “Sing unto the Lord a new hymn. His beginning (initium), His name is glorified
from the height of the earth: they declare His powers in the isles.”1254 And Jeremiah says:
“Behold, I will make a new covenant, not as I made with your fathers”1255 in Mount Horeb.
But one and the same householder produced both covenants, the Word of God, our Lord
Jesus Christ, who spake with both Abraham and Moses, and who has restored us anew to
liberty, and has multiplied that grace which is from Himself.</p>
<p>2. He declares: “For in this place is One greater than the temple.”1256 But [the words]
greater and less are not applied to those things which have nothing in common between
themselves, and are of an opposite nature, and mutually repugnant; but are used in the case
of those of the same substance, and which possess properties in common, but merely differ
in number and size; such as water from water, and light from light, and grace from grace.
Greater, therefore, is that legislation which has been given in order to liberty than that given
in order to bondage; and therefore it has also been diffused, not throughout one nation
[only], but over the whole world. For one and the same Lord, who is greater than the temple,
greater than Solomon, and greater than Jonah, confers gifts upon men, that is, His own

presence, and the resurrection from the dead; but He does not change God, nor proclaim
another Father, but that very same one, who always has more to measure out to those of
His household. And as their love towards God increases, He bestows more and greater
[gifts]; as also the Lord said to His disciples: “Ye shall see greater things than these.”1257
And Paul declares: “Not that I have already attained, or that I am justified, or already have
been made perfect. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is
perfect has come, the things which are in part shall be done away.”1258 As, therefore, when
that which is perfect is come, we shall not see another Father, but Him whom we now desire
to see (for “blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God”1259); neither shall we look
for another Christ and Son of God, but Him who [was born] of the Virgin Mary, who also
suffered, in whom too we trust, and whom we love; as Esaias says: “And they shall say in

1260 and Peter says in his Epistle: “Whom, not seeing, ye love; in whom, though now
ye see Him not, ye have believed, ye shall rejoice with joy unspeakable;”1261 neither do we
receive another Holy Spirit, besides Him who is with us, and who cries, “Abba, Father;”1262
and we shall make increase in the very same things [as now], and shall make progress, so
that no longer through a glass, or by means of enigmas, but face to face, we shall enjoy the
gifts of God;—so also now, receiving more than the temple, and more than Solomon, that
is, the advent of the Son of God, we have not been taught another God besides the Framer
and the Maker of all, who has been pointed out to us from the beginning; nor another Christ,
the Son of God, besides Him who was foretold by the prophets.</p>
<p>3. For the new covenant having been known and preached by the prophets, He who
was to carry it out according to the good pleasure of the Father was also preached, having
been revealed to men as God pleased; that they might always make progress through believing
in Him, and by means of the [successive] covenants, should gradually attain to perfect salvation.

<head>Chapter X.—The Old Testament Scriptures, and those written by Moses in
particular, do everywhere make mention of the Son of God, and foretell His
advent and passion. From this fact it follows that they were inspired by one and
the same God.</head>
<p>1. Wherefore also John does appropriately relate that the Lord said to the Jews: “Ye
search the Scriptures, in which ye think ye have eternal life; these are they which testify of
me. And ye are not willing to come unto Me, that ye may have life.”1268 How therefore did
the Scriptures testify of Him, unless they were from one and the same Father, instructing
men beforehand as to the advent of His Son, and foretelling the salvation brought in by
Him? “For if ye had believed Moses, ye would also have believed Me; for he wrote of Me;”1269
[saying this,] no doubt, because the Son of God is implanted everywhere throughout his
writings: at one time, indeed, speaking with Abraham, when about to eat with him; at another
time with Noah, giving to him the dimensions [of the ark]; at another; inquiring after
Adam; at another, bringing down judgment upon the Sodomites; and again, when He becomes
visible,1270 and directs Jacob on his journey, and speaks with Moses from the bush.1271
And it would be endless to recount [the occasions] upon which the Son of God is shown
forth by Moses. Of the day of His passion, too, he was not ignorant; but foretold Him, after
a figurative manner, by the name given to the passover;1272 and at that very festival, which
had been proclaimed such a long time previously by Moses, did our Lord suffer, thus fulfilling
the passover. And he did not describe the day only, but the place also, and the time of day
at which the sufferings ceased,1273 and the sign of the setting of the sun, saying: “Thou
mayest not sacrifice the passover within any other of thy cities which the Lord God gives
thee; but in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose that His name be called on there,
thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, towards the setting of the sun.”1274</p>

<p>2. And already he had also declared His advent, saying, “There shall not fail a chief in
Judah, nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is laid up, and He is the hope
of the nations; binding His foal to the vine, and His ass’s colt to the creeping ivy. He shall
wash His stole in wine, and His upper garment in the blood of the grape; His eyes shall be
more joyous than wine,1275 and His teeth whiter than milk.”1276 For, let those who have
the reputation of investigating everything, inquire at what time a prince and leader failed
out of Judah, and who is the hope of the nations, who also is the vine, what was the ass’s
colt [referred to as] His, what the clothing, and what the eyes, what the teeth, and what the
wine, and thus let them investigate every one of the points mentioned; and they shall find
that there was none other announced than our Lord, Christ Jesus. Wherefore Moses, when
chiding the ingratitude of the people, said, “Ye infatuated people, and unwise, do ye thus
requite the Lord?”1277 And again, he indicates that He who from the beginning founded
and created them, the Word, who also redeems and vivifies us in the last times, is shown as
hanging on the tree, and they will not believe on Him. For he says, “And thy life shall be
hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy life.”1278 And again, “Has not this

<head>Chapter XI.—The old prophets and righteous men knew beforehand of the
advent of Christ, and earnestly desired to see and hear Him, He revealing himself
in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghost, and without any change in Himself, enriching
men day by day with benefits, but conferring them in greater abundance on later
than on former generations.</head>
<p>1. But that it was not only the prophets and many righteous men, who, foreseeing
through the Holy Spirit His advent, prayed that they might attain to that period in which
they should see their Lord face to face, and hear His words, the Lord has made manifest,
when He says to His disciples, “Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those
things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
have not heard them.”1280 In what way, then, did they desire both to hear and to see, unless
they had foreknowledge of His future advent? But how could they have foreknown it, unless
they had previously received foreknowledge from Himself? And how do the Scriptures
testify of Him, unless all things had ever been revealed and shown to believers by one and
the same God through the Word; He at one time conferring with His creature, and at another
propounding His law; at one time, again, reproving, at another exhorting, and then setting
free His servant, and adopting him as a son (in filium); and, at the proper time, bestowing
an incorruptible inheritance, for the purpose of bringing man to perfection? For He formed
him for growth and increase, as the Scripture says: “Increase and multiply.”1281</p>
<p>2. And in this respect God differs from man, that God indeed makes, but man is made;
and truly, He who makes is always the same; but that which is made must receive both beginning,
and middle, and addition, and increase. And God does indeed create after a skilful
manner, while, [as regards] man, he is created skilfully. God also is truly perfect in all things,
Himself equal and similar to Himself, as He is all light, and all mind, and all substance, and
the fount of all good; but man receives advancement and increase towards God. For as God
is always the same, so also man, when found in God, shall always go on towards God. For
neither does God at any time cease to confer benefits upon, or to enrich man; nor does man
ever cease from receiving the benefits, and being enriched by God. For the receptacle of His
goodness, and the instrument of His glorification, is the man who is grateful to Him that
made him; and again, the receptacle of His just judgment is the ungrateful man, who both
despises his Maker and is not subject to His Word; who has promised that He will give very
much to those always bringing forth fruit, and more [and more] to those who have the
Lord’s money. “Well done,” He says, “good and faithful servant: because thou hast been
faithful in little, I will appoint thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”1282
The Lord Himself thus promises very much.</p>
<note type="footnote">1280 Matt. xiii. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">1281 Gen. i. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">1282 Matt. xxv. 21, etc.</note>

<pb n="1187"/>
<p>3. As, therefore, He has promised to give very much to those who do now bring forth
fruit, according to the gift of His grace, but not according to the changeableness of “knowledge;”
for the Lord remains the same, and the same Father is revealed; thus, therefore, has
the one and the same Lord granted, by means of His advent, a greater gift of grace to those
of a later period, than what He had granted to those under the Old Testament dispensation.
For they indeed used to hear, by means of [His] servants, that the King would come, and
they rejoiced to a certain extent, inasmuch as they hoped for His coming; but those who
have beheld Him actually present, and have obtained liberty, and been made partakers of
His gifts, do possess a greater amount of grace, and a higher degree of exultation, rejoicing
because of the King’s arrival: as also David says, “My soul shall rejoice in the Lord; it shall
be glad in His salvation.”1283 And for this cause, upon His entrance into Jerusalem, all those
who were in the way1284 recognised David their king in His sorrow of soul, and spread their
garments for Him, and ornamented the way with green boughs, crying out with great joy
and gladness, “Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord: hosanna in the highest.”1285 But to the envious wicked stewards, who circumvented
those under them, and ruled over those that had no great intelligence,1286 and for this
reason were unwilling that the king should come, and who said to Him, “Hearest thou what
these say?” did the Lord reply, “Have ye never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
hast Thou perfected praise?”1287—thus pointing out that what had been declared by David
concerning the Son of God, was accomplished in His own person; and indicating that they
were indeed ignorant of the meaning of the Scripture and the dispensation of God; but declaring
that it was Himself who was announced by the prophets as Christ, whose name is
praised in all the earth, and who perfects praise to His Father from the mouth of babes and
sucklings; wherefore also His glory has been raised above the heavens.</p>
<p>4. If, therefore, the self-same person is present who was announced by the prophets,
our Lord Jesus Christ, and if His advent has brought in a fuller [measure of] grace and
greater gifts to those who have received Him, it is plain that the Father also is Himself the
same who was proclaimed by the prophets, and that the Son, on His coming, did not spread
the knowledge of another Father, but of the same who was preached from the beginning;
from whom also He has brought down liberty to those who, in a lawful manner, and with

subject to God, but who follow outward purifications for the praise of men (which observances
had been given as a type of future things,—the law typifying, as it were, certain things
in a shadow, and delineating eternal things by temporal, celestial by terrestrial), and to those
who pretend that they do themselves observe more than what has been prescribed, as if
preferring their own zeal to God Himself, while within they are full of hypocrisy, and covetousness,
and all wickedness,— [to such] has He assigned everlasting perdition by cutting
them off from life.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—It clearly appears that there was but one author of both the old
and the new law, from the fact that Christ condemned traditions and customs
repugnant to the former, while He confirmed its most important precepts, and
taught that He was Himself the end of the Mosaic law.</head>
<p>1. For the tradition of the elders themselves, which they pretended to observe from the
law, was contrary to the law given by Moses. Wherefore also Esaias declares: “Thy dealers
mix the wine with water,”1288 showing that the elders were in the habit of mingling a watered
tradition with the simple command of God; that is, they set up a spurious law, and one
contrary to the [true] law; as also the Lord made plain, when He said to them, “Why do ye
transgress the commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition?”1289 For not only by
actual transgression did they set the law of God at nought, mingling the wine with water;
but they also set up their own law in opposition to it, which is termed, even to the present
day, the pharisaical. In this [law] they suppress certain things, add others, and interpret
others, again, as they think proper, which their teachers use, each one in particular; and
desiring to uphold these traditions, they were unwilling to be subject to the law of God,
which prepares them for the coming of Christ. But they did even blame the Lord for healing
on the Sabbath-days, which, as I have already observed, the law did not prohibit. For they
did themselves, in one sense, perform acts of healing upon the Sabbath-day, when they circumcised
a man [on that day]; but they did not blame themselves for transgressing the
command of God through tradition and the aforesaid pharisaical law, and for not keeping
the commandment of the law, which is the love of God.</p>
<p>2. But that this is the first and greatest commandment, and that the next [has respect
to love] towards our neighbour, the Lord has taught, when He says that the entire law and
the prophets hang upon these two commandments. Moreover, He did not Himself bring
down [from heaven] any other commandment greater than this one, but renewed this very
same one to His disciples, when He enjoined them to love God with all their heart, and
others as themselves. But if He had descended from another Father, He never would have
made use of the first and greatest commandment of the law; but He would undoubtedly
have endeavoured by all means to bring down a greater one than this from the perfect
Father, so as not to make use of that which had been given by the God of the law. And Paul
in like manner declares, “Love is the fulfilling of the law:”1290 and [he declares] that when
all other things have been destroyed, there shall remain “faith, hope, and love; but the greatest
of all is love;”1291 and that apart from the love of God, neither knowledge avails anything,1292
<note type="footnote">1288 Isa. i. 22.</note>

<pb n="1190"/>
nor the understanding of mysteries, nor faith, nor prophecy, but that without love all are
hollow and vain; moreover, that love makes man perfect; and that he who loves God is
perfect, both in this world and in that which is to come. For we do never cease from loving
God; but in proportion as we continue to contemplate Him, so much the more do we love
Him.</p>
<p>3. As in the law, therefore, and in the Gospel [likewise], the first and greatest commandment
is, to love the Lord God with the whole heart, and then there follows a commandment
like to it, to love one’s neighbour as one’s self; the author of the law and the Gospel is shown
to be one and the same. For the precepts of an absolutely perfect life, since they are the same
in each Testament, have pointed out [to us] the same God, who certainly has promulgated
particular laws adapted for each; but the more prominent and the greatest [commandments],
without which salvation cannot [be attained], He has exhorted [us to observe] the same in
both.</p>
<p>4. The Lord, too, does not do away with this [God], when He shows that the law was
not derived from another God, expressing Himself as follows to those who were being instructed
by Him, to the multitude and to His disciples: “The scribes and Pharisees sit in
Moses’ seat. All, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do
not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens, and lay them
upon men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not so much as move them with a finger.”1293
He therefore did not throw blame upon that law which was given by Moses, when He exhorted
it to be observed, Jerusalem being as yet in safety; but He did throw blame upon those
persons, because they repeated indeed the words of the law, yet were without love. And for
this reason were they held as being unrighteous as respects God, and as respects their
neighbours. As also Isaiah says: “This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart
is far from Me: howbeit in vain do they worship Me, teaching the doctrines and the commandments
of men.”1294 He does not call the law given by Moses commandments of men,
but the traditions of the elders themselves which they had invented, and in upholding which
they made the law of God of none effect, and were on this account also not subject to His
Word. For this is what Paul says concerning these men: “For they, being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
to every one that believeth.”1295 And how is Christ the end of the law, if He be not also the
final cause of it? For He who has brought in the end has Himself also wrought the beginning;
and it is He who does Himself say to Moses, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people
<note type="footnote">1293 Matt. xxiii. 2–4.</note>

<pb n="1191"/>
which is in Egypt, and I have come down to deliver them;”1296 it being customary from the
beginning with the Word of God to ascend and descend for the purpose of saving those
who were in affliction.</p>
<p>5. Now, that the law did beforehand teach mankind the necessity of following Christ,
He does Himself make manifest, when He replied as follows to him who asked Him what
he should do that he might inherit eternal life: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”
1297 But upon the other asking “Which?” again the Lord replies: “Do not
commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honour father and
mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,”—setting as an ascending series (velut
gradus) before those who wished to follow Him, the precepts of the law, as the entrance into
life; and what He then said to one He said to all. But when the former said, “All these have
I done” (and most likely he had not kept them, for in that case the Lord would not have said
to him, “Keep the commandments”), the Lord, exposing his covetousness, said to him, “If
thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor; and come, follow
me;” promising to those who would act thus, the portion belonging to the apostles (apostolorum
partem). And He did not preach to His followers another God the Father, besides
Him who was proclaimed by the law from the beginning; nor another Son; nor the Mother,
the enthymesis of the Æon, who existed in suffering and apostasy; nor the Pleroma of the
thirty Æons, which has been proved vain, and incapable of being believed in; nor that fable
invented by the other heretics. But He taught that they should obey the commandments
which God enjoined from the beginning, and do away with their former covetousness by
good works,1298 and follow after Christ. But that possessions distributed to the poor do
annul former covetousness, Zaccheus made evident, when he said, “Behold, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one, I restore fourfold.”1299</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Christ did not abrogate the natural precepts of the law, but rather
fulfilled and extended them. He removed the yoke and bondage of the old law,
so that mankind, being now set free, might serve God with that trustful piety
which becometh sons.</head>
<p>1. And that the Lord did not abrogate the natural [precepts] of the law, by which man1300
is justified, which also those who were justified by faith, and who pleased God, did observe
previous to the giving of the law, but that He extended and fulfilled them, is shown from
His words. “For,” He remarks, “it has been said to them of old time, Do not commit adultery.
But I say unto you, That every one who hath looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath
committed adultery with her already in his heart.”1301 And again: “It has been said, Thou
shalt not kill. But I say unto you, Every one who is angry with his brother without a cause,
shall be in danger of the judgment.”1302 And, “It hath been said, Thou shalt not forswear
thyself. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; but let your conversation be, Yea, yea, and Nay,
nay.”1303 And other statements of a like nature. For all these do not contain or imply an
opposition to and an overturning of the [precepts] of the past, as Marcion’s followers do
strenuously maintain; but [they exhibit] a fulfilling and an extension of them, as He does
Himself declare: “Unless your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”1304 For what meant the excess referred to?
In the first place, [we must] believe not only in the Father, but also in His Son now revealed;
for He it is who leads man into fellowship and unity with God. In the next place, [we must]
not only say, but we must do; for they said, but did not. And [we must] not only abstain
from evil deeds, but even from the desires after them. Now He did not teach us these things
as being opposed to the law, but as fulfilling the law, and implanting in us the varied righteousness
of the law. That would have been contrary to the law, if He had commanded His
disciples to do anything which the law had prohibited. But this which He did command—
namely, not only to abstain from things forbidden by the law, but even from longing
after them—is not contrary to [the law], as I have remarked, neither is it the utterance of
one destroying the law, but of one fulfilling, extending, and affording greater scope to it.</p>
<p>2. For the law, since it was laid down for those in bondage, used to instruct the soul by
means of those corporeal objects which were of an external nature, drawing it, as by a bond,
to obey its commandments, that man might learn to serve God. But the Word set free the
soul, and taught that through it the body should be willingly purified. Which having been

that the laws of liberty should be extended, and subjection to the king increased, so that no
one who is converted should appear unworthy to Him who set him free, but that the piety
and obedience due to the Master of the household should be equally rendered both by servants
and children; while the children possess greater confidence [than the servants], inasmuch
as the working of liberty is greater and more glorious than that obedience which is
rendered in [a state of] slavery.</p>
<p>3. And for this reason did the Lord, instead of that [commandment], “Thou shalt not
commit adultery,” forbid even concupiscence; and instead of that which runs thus, “Thou
shalt not kill,” He prohibited anger; and instead of the law enjoining the giving of tithes,
[He told us] to share1305 all our possessions with the poor; and not to love our neighbours
only, but even our enemies; and not merely to be liberal givers and bestowers, but even that
we should present a gratuitous gift to those who take away our goods. For “to him that
taketh away thy coat,” He says, “give to him thy cloak also; and from him that taketh away
thy goods, ask them not again; and as ye would that men should do unto you, do ye unto
them:”1306 so that we may not grieve as those who are unwilling to be defrauded, but may
rejoice as those who have given willingly, and as rather conferring a favour upon our
neighbours than yielding to necessity. “And if any one,” He says, “shall compel thee [to go]
a mile, go with him twain;”1307 so that thou mayest not follow him as a slave, but may as a
free man go before him, showing thyself in all things kindly disposed and useful to thy
neighbour, not regarding their evil intentions, but performing thy kind offices, assimilating
thyself to the Father, “who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth
rain upon the just and unjust.”1308 Now all these [precepts], as I have already observed,
were not [the injunctions] of one doing away with the law, but of one fulfilling, extending,
and widening it among us; just as if one should say, that the more extensive operation of
liberty implies that a more complete subjection and affection towards our Liberator had
been implanted within us. For He did not set us free for this purpose, that we should depart
from Him (no one, indeed, while placed out of reach of the Lord’s benefits, has power to
procure for himself the means of salvation), but that the more we receive His grace, the
more we should love Him. Now the more we have loved Him, the more glory shall we receive
from Him, when we are continually in the presence of the Father.</p>

<p>4. Inasmuch, then, as all natural precepts are common to us and to them (the Jews),
they had in them indeed the beginning and origin; but in us they have received growth and
completion. For to yield assent to God, and to follow His Word, and to love Him above all,
and one’s neighbour as one’s self (now man is neighbour to man), and to abstain from every
evil deed, and all other things of a like nature which are common to both [covenants], do
reveal one and the same God. But this is our Lord, the Word of God, who in the first instance
certainly drew slaves to God, but afterwards He set those free who were subject to Him, as
He does Himself declare to His disciples: “I will not now call you servants, for the servant
knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have
heard from My Father I have made known.”1309 For in that which He says, “I will not now
call you servants,” He indicates in the most marked manner that it was Himself who did
originally appoint for men that bondage with respect to God through the law, and then afterwards
conferred upon them freedom. And in that He says, “For the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth,” He points out, by means of His own advent, the ignorance of a people
in a servile condition. But when He terms His disciples “the friends of God,” He plainly
declares Himself to be the Word of God, whom Abraham also followed voluntarily and
under no compulsion (sine vinculis), because of the noble nature of his faith, and so became
“the friend of God.”1310 But the Word of God did not accept of the friendship of Abraham,
as though He stood in need of it, for He was perfect from the beginning (“Before Abraham
was,” He says, “I am”1311), but that He in His goodness might bestow eternal life upon Abraham
himself, inasmuch as the friendship of God imparts immortality to those who embrace
it.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—If God demands obedience from man, if He formed man, called
him and placed him under laws, it was merely for man’s welfare; not that God
stood in need of man, but that He graciously conferred upon man His favours
in every possible manner.</head>
<p>1. In the beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood in need of man,
but that He might have [some one] upon whom to confer His benefits. For not alone antecedently
to Adam, but also before all creation, the Word glorified His Father, remaining in
Him; and was Himself glorified by the Father, as He did Himself declare, “Father, glorify
Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.”1312 Nor did He stand
in need of our service when He ordered us to follow Him; but He thus bestowed salvation
upon ourselves. For to follow the Saviour is to be a partaker of salvation, and to follow light
is to receive light. But those who are in light do not themselves illumine the light, but are
illumined and revealed by it: they do certainly contribute nothing to it, but, receiving the
benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also, service [rendered] to God does indeed
profit God nothing, nor has God need of human obedience; but He grants to those who
follow and serve Him life and incorruption and eternal glory, bestowing benefit upon those
who serve [Him], because they do serve Him, and on His followers, because they do follow
Him; but does not receive any benefit from them: for He is rich, perfect, and in need of
nothing. But for this reason does God demand service from men, in order that, since He is
good and merciful, He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God
is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship with God. For this is
the glory of man, to continue and remain permanently in God’s service. Wherefore also did
the Lord say to His disciples, “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;”1313 indicating
that they did not glorify Him when they followed Him; but that, in following the Son of
God, they were glorified by Him. And again, “I will, that where I am, there they also may
be, that they may behold My glory;”1314 not vainly boasting because of this, but desiring
that His disciples should share in His glory: of whom Esaias also says, “I will bring thy seed
from the east, and will gather thee from the west; and I will say to the north, Give up; and
to the south, Keep not back: bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the ends of
the earth; all, as many as have been called in My name: for in My glory I have prepared, and
formed, and made him.”1315 Inasmuch as then, “wheresoever the carcase is, there shall also
the eagles be gathered together,”1316 we do participate in the glory of the Lord, who has

<pb n="1196"/>
both formed us, and prepared us for this, that, when we are with Him, we may partake of
His glory.</p>
<p>2. Thus it was, too, that God formed man at the first, because of His munificence; but
chose the patriarchs for the sake of their salvation; and prepared a people beforehand,
teaching the headstrong to follow God; and raised up prophets upon earth, accustoming
man to bear His Spirit [within him], and to hold communion with God: He Himself, indeed,
having need of nothing, but granting communion with Himself to those who stood in need
of it, and sketching out, like an architect, the plan of salvation to those that pleased Him.
And He did Himself furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in Egypt, while to those
who became unruly in the desert He promulgated a law very suitable [to their condition].
Then, on the people who entered into the good land He bestowed a noble inheritance; and
He killed the fatted calf for those converted to the Father, and presented them with the finest
robe.1317 Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the human race to an agreement with salvation.
On this account also does John declare in the Apocalypse, “And His voice as the
sound of many waters.”1318 For the Spirit [of God] is truly [like] many waters, since the
Father is both rich and great. And the Word, passing through all those [men], did liberally
confer benefits upon His subjects, by drawing up in writing a law adapted and applicable
to every class [among them].</p>
<p>3. Thus, too, He imposed upon the [Jewish] people the construction of the tabernacle,
the building of the temple, the election of the Levites, sacrifices also, and oblations, legal
monitions, and all the other service of the law. He does Himself truly want none of these
things, for He is always full of all good, and had in Himself all the odour of kindness, and
every perfume of sweet-smelling savours, even before Moses existed. Moreover, He instructed
the people, who were prone to turn to idols, instructing them by repeated appeals to persevere
and to serve God, calling them to the things of primary importance by means of those which
were secondary; that is, to things that are real, by means of those that are typical; and by
things temporal, to eternal; and by the carnal to the spiritual; and by the earthly to the
heavenly; as was also said to Moses, “Thou shalt make all things after the pattern of those
things which thou sawest in the mount.”1319 For during forty days He was learning to keep
[in his memory] the words of God, and the celestial patterns, and the spiritual images, and
the types of things to come; as also Paul says: “For they drank of the rock which followed
them: and the rock was Christ.”1320 And again, having first mentioned what are contained
in the law, he goes on to say: “Now all these things happened to them in a figure; but they

<head>Chapter XV.—At first God deemed it sufficient to inscribe the natural law, or
the Decalogue, upon the hearts of men; but afterwards He found it necessary to
bridle, with the yoke of the Mosaic law, the desires of the Jews, who were abusing
their liberty; and even to add some special commands, because of the hardness
of their hearts.</head>
<p>1. They (the Jews) had therefore a law, a course of discipline, and a prophecy of future
things. For God at the first, indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from
the beginning He had implanted in mankind, that is, by means of the Decalogue (which, if
any one does not observe, he has no salvation), did then demand nothing more of them. As
Moses says in Deuteronomy, “These are all the words which the Lord spake to the whole
assembly of the sons of Israel on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them
on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.”1321 For this reason [He did so], that they who
are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments. But when they turned themselves
to make a calf, and had gone back in their minds to Egypt, desiring to be slaves instead of
free-men, they were placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish,—[a
slavery] which did not indeed cut them off from God, but subjected them to the yoke of
bondage; as Ezekiel the prophet, when stating the reasons for the giving of such a law, declares:
“And their eyes were after the desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were
not good, and judgments in which they shall not live.”1322 Luke also has recorded that
Stephen, who was the first elected into the diaconate by the apostles,1323 and who was the
first slain for the testimony of Christ, spoke regarding Moses as follows: “This man did indeed
receive the commandments of the living God to give to us, whom your fathers would not
obey, but thrust [Him from them], and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, saying
unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for we do not know what has happened to [this]
Moses, who led us from the land of Egypt. And they made a calf in those days, and offered
sacrifices to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned,
and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets:
1324 O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to Me sacrifices and oblations for forty years
in the wilderness? And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of the god Remphan,
1325 figures which ye made to worship them;”1326 pointing out plainly, that the law
being such, was not given to them by another God, but that, adapted to their condition of

servitude, [it originated] from the very same [God as we worship]. Wherefore also He says
to Moses in Exodus: “I will send forth My angel before thee; for I will not go up with thee,
because thou art a stiff-necked people.”1327</p>
<p>2. And not only so, but the Lord also showed that certain precepts were enacted for
them by Moses, on account of their hardness [of heart], and because of their unwillingness
to be obedient, when, on their saying to Him, “Why then did Moses command to give a
writing of divorcement, and to send away a wife?” He said to them, “Because of the hardness
of your hearts he permitted these things to you; but from the beginning it was not so;”1328
thus exculpating Moses as a faithful servant, but acknowledging one God, who from the
beginning made male and female, and reproving them as hard-hearted and disobedient.
And therefore it was that they received from Moses this law of divorcement, adapted to
their hard nature. But why say I these things concerning the Old Testament? For in the New
also are the apostles found doing this very thing, on the ground which has been mentioned,
Paul plainly declaring, “But these things I say, not the Lord.”1329 And again: “But this I
speak by permission, not by commandment.”1330 And again: “Now, as concerning virgins,
I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained
mercy of the Lord to be faithful.”1331 But further, in another place he says: “That Satan
tempt you not for your incontinence.”1332 If, therefore, even in the New Testament, the
apostles are found granting certain precepts in consideration of human infirmity, because
of the incontinence of some, lest such persons, having grown obdurate, and despairing altogether
of their salvation, should become apostates from God,—it ought not to be wondered
at, if also in the Old Testament the same God permitted similar indulgences for the benefit
of His people, drawing them on by means of the ordinances already mentioned, so that they
might obtain the gift of salvation through them, while they obeyed the Decalogue, and being
restrained by Him, should not revert to idolatry, nor apostatize from God, but learn to love
Him with the whole heart. And if certain persons, because of the disobedient and ruined
Israelites, do assert that the giver (doctor) of the law was limited in power, they will find in
our dispensation, that “many are called, but few chosen;”1333 and that there are those who
inwardly are wolves, yet wear sheep’s clothing in the eyes of the world (foris); and that God
has always preserved freedom, and the power of self-government in man,1334 while at the

<head>Chapter XVI.—Perfect righteousness was conferred neither by circumcision nor
by any other legal ceremonies. The Decalogue, however, was not cancelled by
Christ, but is always in force: men were never released from its commandments.</head>
<p>1. Moreover, we learn from the Scripture itself, that God gave circumcision, not as the
completer of righteousness, but as a sign, that the race of Abraham might continue recognisable.
For it declares: “God said unto Abraham, Every male among you shall be circumcised;
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, as a token of the covenant between Me
and you.”1335 This same does Ezekiel the prophet say with regard to the Sabbaths: “Also I
gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am
the Lord, that sanctify them.”1336 And in Exodus, God says to Moses: “And ye shall observe
My Sabbaths; for it shall be a sign between Me and you for your generations.”1337 These
things, then, were given for a sign; but the signs were not unsymbolical, that is, neither unmeaning
nor to no purpose, inasmuch as they were given by a wise Artist; but the circumcision
after the flesh typified that after the Spirit. For “we,” says the apostle, “have been circumcised
with the circumcision made without hands.”1338 And the prophet declares, “Circumcise
the hardness of your heart.”1339 But the Sabbaths taught that we should continue
day by day in God’s service.1340 “For we have been counted,” says the Apostle Paul, “all the
day long as sheep for the slaughter;”1341 that is, consecrated [to God], and ministering
continually to our faith, and persevering in it, and abstaining from all avarice, and not acquiring
or possessing treasures upon earth.1342 Moreover, the Sabbath of God (requietio
Dei), that is, the kingdom, was, as it were, indicated by created things; in which [kingdom],
the man who shall have persevered in serving God (Deo assistere) shall, in a state of rest,
partake of God’s table.</p>
<p>2. And that man was not justified by these things, but that they were given as a sign to
the people, this fact shows,— that Abraham himself, without circumcision and without
observance of Sabbaths, “believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and
he was called the friend of God.”1343 Then, again, Lot, without circumcision, was brought

out from Sodom, receiving salvation from God. So also did Noah, pleasing God, although
he was uncircumcised, receive the dimensions [of the ark], of the world of the second race
[of men]. Enoch, too, pleasing God, without circumcision, discharged the office of God’s
legate to the angels although he was a man, and was translated, and is preserved until now
as a witness of the just judgment of God, because the angels when they had transgressed fell
to the earth for judgment, but the man who pleased [God] was translated for salvation.1344
Moreover, all the rest of the multitude of those righteous men who lived before Abraham,
and of those patriarchs who preceded Moses, were justified independently of the things
above mentioned, and without the law of Moses. As also Moses himself says to the people
in Deuteronomy: “The Lord thy God formed a covenant in Horeb. The Lord formed not
this covenant with your fathers, but for you.”1345</p>
<p>3. Why, then, did the Lord not form the covenant for the fathers? Because “the law was
not established for righteous men.”1346 But the righteous fathers had the meaning of the
Decalogue written in their hearts and souls,1347 that is, they loved the God who made them,
and did no injury to their neighbour. There was therefore no occasion that they should be
cautioned by prohibitory mandates (correptoriis literis),1348 because they had the righteousness
of the law in themselves. But when this righteousness and love to God had passed into
oblivion, and became extinct in Egypt, God did necessarily, because of His great goodwill
to men, reveal Himself by a voice, and led the people with power out of Egypt, in order that
man might again become the disciple and follower of God; and He afflicted those who were
disobedient, that they should not contemn their Creator; and He fed them with manna, that
they might receive food for their souls (uti rationalem acciperent escam); as also Moses says
in Deuteronomy: “And fed thee with manna, which thy fathers did not know, that thou
mightest know that man doth not live by bread alone; but by every word of God proceeding
out of His mouth doth man live.”1349 And it enjoined love to God, and taught just dealing
towards our neighbour, that we should neither be unjust nor unworthy of God, who prepares

man for His friendship through the medium of the Decalogue, and likewise for agreement
with his neighbour,—matters which did certainly profit man himself; God, however,
standing in no need of anything from man.</p>
<p>4. And therefore does the Scripture say, “These words the Lord spake to all the assembly
of the children of Israel in the mount, and He added no more;”1350 for, as I have already
observed, He stood in need of nothing from them. And again Moses says: “And now Israel,
what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all His
ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul?”1351 Now these things did indeed make man glorious, by supplying what was wanting
to him, namely, the friendship of God; but they profited God nothing, for God did not at
all stand in need of man’s love. For the glory of God was wanting to man, which he could
obtain in no other way than by serving God. And therefore Moses says to them again:
“Choose life, that thou mayest live, and thy seed, to love the Lord thy God, to hear His voice,
to cleave unto Him; for this is thy life, and the length of thy days.”1352 Preparing man for
this life, the Lord Himself did speak in His own person to all alike the words of the Decalogue;
and therefore, in like manner, do they remain permanently with us,1353 receiving by means
of His advent in the flesh, extension and increase, but not abrogation.</p>
<p>5. The laws of bondage, however, were one by one promulgated to the people by Moses,
suited for their instruction or for their punishment, as Moses himself declared: “And the
Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments.”1354 These things,
therefore, which were given for bondage, and for a sign to them, He cancelled by the new
covenant of liberty. But He has increased and widened those laws which are natural, and
noble, and common to all, granting to men largely and without grudging, by means of adoption,
to know God the Father, and to love Him with the whole heart, and to follow His
word unswervingly, while they abstain not only from evil deeds, but even from the desire
after them. But He has also increased the feeling of reverence; for sons should have more
veneration than slaves, and greater love for their father. And therefore the Lord says, “As
to every idle word that men have spoken, they shall render an account for it in the day of
judgment.”1355 And, “he who has looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart;”1356 and, “he that is angry with his brother without

severely tested, whether he will reverence, and fear, and love the Lord. And for this reason

His own sake, or as requiring such service; for He does, in fact, need nothing

<p>1. Moreover, the prophets indicate in the fullest manner that God stood in no need of
their slavish obedience, but that it was upon their own account that He enjoined certain
observances in the law. And again, that God needed not their oblation, but [merely demanded
it], on account of man himself who offers it, the Lord taught distinctly, as I have pointed
out. For when He perceived them neglecting righteousness, and abstaining from the love
of God, and imagining that God was to be propitiated by sacrifices and the other typical
observances, Samuel did even thus speak to them: “God does not desire whole burnt-offerings
and sacrifices, but He will have His voice to be hearkened to. Behold, a ready obedience is
better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.”1359 David also says: “Sacrifice
and oblation Thou didst not desire, but mine ears hast Thou perfected;1360 burnt-offerings
also for sin Thou hast not required.”1361 He thus teaches them that God desires obedience,
which renders them secure, rather than sacrifices and holocausts, which avail them nothing
towards righteousness; and [by this declaration] he prophesies the new covenant at the same
time. Still clearer, too, does he speak of these things in the fiftieth Psalm: “For if Thou hadst
desired sacrifice, then would I have given it: Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The
sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart the Lord will not despise.”1362
Because, therefore, God stands in need of nothing, He declares in the preceding Psalm: “I
will take no calves out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy fold. For Mine are all the beasts
of the earth, the herds and the oxen on the mountains: I know all the fowls of heaven, and
the various tribes1363 of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the
world is Mine, and the fulness thereof. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
goats?”1364 Then, lest it might be supposed that He refused these things in His anger, He
continues, giving him (man) counsel: “Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy
vows to the Most High; and call upon Me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify Me;”1365 rejecting, indeed, those things by which sinners imagined

they could propitiate God, and showing that He does Himself stand in need of nothing; but
He exhorts and advises them to those things by which man is justified and draws nigh to
God. This same declaration does Esaias make: “To what purpose is the multitude of your
sacrifices unto Me? saith the Lord. I am full.”1366 And when He had repudiated holocausts,
and sacrifices, and oblations, as likewise the new moons, and the sabbaths, and the festivals,
and all the rest of the services accompanying these, He continues, exhorting them to what
pertained to salvation: “Wash you, make you clean, take away wickedness from your hearts
from before mine eyes: cease from your evil ways, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve
the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together,
saith the Lord.</p>
<p>2. For it was not because He was angry, like a man, as many venture to say, that He rejected
their sacrifices; but out of compassion to their blindness, and with the view of suggesting
to them the true sacrifice, by offering which they shall appease God, that they may receive
life from Him. As He elsewhere declares: “The sacrifice to God is an afflicted heart: a sweet
savour to God is a heart glorifying Him who formed it.”1367 For if, when angry, He had repudiated
these sacrifices of theirs, as if they were persons unworthy to obtain His compassion,
He would not certainly have urged these same things upon them as those by which they
might be saved. But inasmuch as God is merciful, He did not cut them off from good
counsel. For after He had said by Jeremiah, “To what purpose bring ye Me incense from
Saba, and cinnamon from a far country? Your whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices are not
acceptable to Me;”1368 He proceeds: “Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah. These things
saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Make straight your ways and your doings, and I will establish
you in this place. Put not your trust in lying words, for they will not at all profit you, saying,
The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, it is [here].”1369</p>
<p>3. And again, when He points out that it was not for this that He led them out of Egypt,
that they might offer sacrifice to Him, but that, forgetting the idolatry of the Egyptians, they
should be able to hear the voice of the Lord, which was to them salvation and glory, He declares
by this same Jeremiah: “Thus saith the Lord; Collect together your burnt-offerings
with your sacrifices and eat flesh. For I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them
in the day that I brought them out of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but

this word I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall
be My people; and walk in all My ways whatsoever I have commanded you, that it may be
well with you. But they obeyed not, nor hearkened; but walked in the imaginations of their
own evil heart, and went backwards, and not forwards.”1370 And again, when He declares
by the same man, “But let him that glorieth, glory in this, to understand and know that I
am the Lord, who doth exercise loving-kindness, and righteousness, and judgment in the
earth;”1371 He adds, “For in these things I delight, says the Lord,” but not in sacrifices, nor
in holocausts, nor in oblations. For the people did not receive these precepts as of primary
importance (principaliter), but as secondary, and for the reason already alleged, as Isaiah
again says: “Thou hast not [brought to] Me the sheep of thy holocaust, nor in thy sacrifices
hast thou glorified Me: thou hast not served Me in sacrifices, nor in [the matter of]
frankincense hast thou done anything laboriously; neither hast thou bought for Me incense
with money, nor have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast stood before Me in
thy sins and in thine iniquities.”1372 He says, therefore, “Upon this man will I look, even
upon him that is humble, and meek, and who trembles at My words.”1373 “For the fat and
the fat flesh shall not take away from thee thine unrighteousness.”1374 “This is the fast which
I have chosen, saith the Lord. Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve the connections of
violent agreements, give rest to those that are shaken, and cancel every unjust document.
Deal thy bread to the hungry willingly, and lead into thy house the roofless stranger. If thou
hast seen the naked, cover him, and thou shalt not despise those of thine own flesh and
blood (domesticos seminis tui). Then shall thy morning light break forth, and thy health
shall spring forth more speedily; and righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the
Lord shall surround thee: and whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Behold, here I am.”1375
And Zechariah also, among the twelve prophets, pointing out to the people the will of God,
says: “These things does the Lord Omnipotent declare: Execute true judgment, and show
mercy and compassion each one to his brother. And oppress not the widow, and the orphan,
and the proselyte, and the poor; and let none imagine evil against your brother in his
heart.”1376 And again, he says: “These are the words which ye shall utter. Speak ye the truth
every man to his neighbour, and execute peaceful judgment in your gates, and let none of
you imagine evil in his heart against his brother, and ye shall not love false swearing: for all

these things I hate, saith the Lord Almighty.”1377 Moreover, David also says in like manner:
“What man is there who desireth life, and would fain see good days? Keep thy tongue from
evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile. Shun evil, and do good: seek peace, and pursue
it.”1378</p>	
<p>4. From all these it is evident that God did not seek sacrifices and holocausts from them,
but faith, and obedience, and righteousness, because of their salvation. As God, when
teaching them His will in Hosea the prophet, said, “I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and
the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.”1379 Besides, our Lord also exhorted them
to the same effect, when He said, “But if ye had known what [this] meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.”1380 Thus does He
bear witness to the prophets, that they preached the truth; but accuses these men (His
hearers) of being foolish through their own fault.</p>
<p>5. Again, giving directions to His disciples to offer to God the first-fruits1381 of His own,
created things—not as if He stood in need of them, but that they might be themselves neither
unfruitful nor ungrateful—He took that created thing, bread, and gave thanks, and said,
“This is My body.”1382 And the cup likewise, which is part of that creation to which we belong,
He confessed to be His blood, and taught the new oblation of the new covenant; which
the Church receiving from the apostles, offers to God throughout all the world, to Him who
gives us as the means of subsistence the first-fruits of His own gifts in the New Testament,
concerning which Malachi, among the twelve prophets, thus spoke beforehand: “I have no
pleasure in you, saith the Lord Omnipotent, and I will not accept sacrifice at your hands.
For from the rising of the sun, unto the going down [of the same], My name is glorified
among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to My name, and a pure sacrifice;
for great is My name among the Gentiles, saith the Lord Omnipotent;”1383—indicating in
the plainest manner, by these words, that the former people [the Jews] shall indeed cease to
make offerings to God, but that in every place sacrifice shall be offered to Him, and that a
pure one; and His name is glorified among the Gentiles.1384</p>

<p>6. But what other name is there which is glorified among the Gentiles than that of our
Lord, by whom the Father is glorified, and man also? And because it is [the name] of His
own Son, who was made man by Him, He calls it His own. Just as a king, if he himself paints
a likeness of his son, is right in calling this likeness his own, for both these reasons, because
it is [the likeness] of his son, and because it is his own production; so also does the Father
confess the name of Jesus Christ, which is throughout all the world glorified in the Church,
to be His own, both because it is that of His Son, and because He who thus describes it gave
Him for the salvation of men. Since, therefore, the name of the Son belongs to the Father,
and since in the omnipotent God the Church makes offerings through Jesus Christ, He says
well on both these grounds, “And in every place incense is offered to My name, and a pure
sacrifice.” Now John, in the Apocalypse, declares that the “incense” is “the prayers of the
saints.”1385</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Concerning sacrifices and oblations, and those who truly offer
them.</head>
<p>1. The oblation of the Church, therefore, which the Lord gave instructions to be offered
throughout all the world, is accounted with God a pure sacrifice, and is acceptable to Him;
not that He stands in need of a sacrifice from us, but that he who offers is himself glorified
in what he does offer, if his gift be accepted. For by the gift both honour and affection are
shown forth towards the King; and the Lord, wishing us to offer it in all simplicity and innocence,
did express Himself thus: “Therefore, when thou offerest thy gift upon the altar,
and shalt remember that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave thy gift before the altar,
and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then return and offer thy gift.”1386
We are bound, therefore, to offer to God the first-fruits of His creation, as Moses also says,
“Thou shalt not appear in the presence of the Lord thy God empty;”1387 so that man, being
accounted as grateful, by those things in which he has shown his gratitude, may receive that
honour which flows from Him.1388</p>
<p>2. And the class of oblations in general has not been set aside; for there were both obla-
tions there [among the Jews], and there are oblations here [among the Christians]. Sacrifices
there were among the people; sacrifices there are, too, in the Church: but the species alone
has been changed, inasmuch as the offering is now made, not by slaves, but by freemen. For
the Lord is [ever] one and the same; but the character of a servile oblation is peculiar [to itself],
as is also that of freemen, in order that, by the very oblations, the indication of liberty
may be set forth. For with Him there is nothing purposeless, nor without signification, nor
without design. And for this reason they (the Jews) had indeed the tithes of their goods
consecrated to Him, but those who have received liberty set aside all their possessions for
the Lord’s purposes, bestowing joyfully and freely not the less valuable portions of their
property, since they have the hope of better things [hereafter]; as that poor widow acted
who cast all her living into the treasury of God.1389</p>
<p>3. For at the beginning God had respect to the gifts of Abel, because he offered with
single-mindedness and righteousness; but He had no respect unto the offering of Cain, because
his heart was divided with envy and malice, which he cherished against his brother,
as God says when reproving his hidden [thoughts], “Though thou offerest rightly, yet, if
thou dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at rest;”1390 since God is not appeased

by sacrifice. For if any one shall endeavour to offer a sacrifice merely to outward appearance,
unexceptionably, in due order, and according to appointment, while in his soul he does not
assign to his neighbour that fellowship with him which is right and proper, nor is under the
fear of God;— he who thus cherishes secret sin does not deceive God by that sacrifice which
is offered correctly as to outward appearance; nor will such an oblation profit him anything,
but [only] the giving up of that evil which has been conceived within him, so that sin may
not the more, by means of the hypocritical action, render him the destroyer of himself.1391
Wherefore did the Lord also declare: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for
ye are like whited sepulchres. For the sepulchre appears beautiful outside, but within it is
full of dead men’s bones, and all uncleanness; even so ye also outwardly appear righteous
unto men, but within ye are full of wickedness and hypocrisy.”1392 For while they were
thought to offer correctly so far as outward appearance went, they had in themselves jealousy
like to Cain; therefore they slew the Just One, slighting the counsel of the Word, as did also
Cain. For [God] said to him, “Be at rest;” but he did not assent. Now what else is it to “be
at rest” than to forego purposed violence? And saying similar things to these men, He declares:
“Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside may be
clean also.”1393 And they did not listen to Him. For Jeremiah says, “Behold, neither thine
eyes nor thy heart are good; but [they are turned] to thy covetousness, and to shed innocent
blood, and for injustice, and for man-slaying, that thou mayest do it.”1394 And again Isaiah
saith, “Ye have taken counsel, but not of Me; and made covenants, [but] not by My Spirit.”1395
In order, therefore, that their inner wish and thought, being brought to light, may show that
God is without blame, and worketh no evil —that God who reveals what is hidden [in the
heart], but who worketh not evil—when Cain was by no means at rest, He saith to him: “To
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”1396 Thus did He in like manner speak
to Pilate: “Thou shouldest have no power at all against Me, unless it were given thee from
above;”1397 God always giving up the righteous one [in this life to suffering], that he, having
been tested by what he suffered and endured, may [at last] be accepted; but that the evildoer,
being judged by the actions he has performed, may be rejected. Sacrifices, therefore, do not
sanctify a man, for God stands in no need of sacrifice; but it is the conscience of the offerer

that sanctifies the sacrifice when it is pure, and thus moves God to accept [the offering] as
from a friend. “But the sinner,” says He, “who kills a calf [in sacrifice] to Me, is as if he slew
a dog.”1398</p>
<p>4. Inasmuch, then, as the Church offers with single-mindedness, her gift is justly reckoned
a pure sacrifice with God. As Paul also says to the Philippians, “I am full, having received
from Epaphroditus the things that were sent from you, the odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice
acceptable, pleasing to God.”1399 For it behoves us to make an oblation to God, and in all
things to be found grateful to God our Maker, in a pure mind, and in faith without hypocrisy,
in well-grounded hope, in fervent love, offering the first-fruits of His own created things.
And the Church alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator, offering to Him, with giving
of thanks, [the things taken] from His creation. But the Jews do not offer thus: for their
hands are full of blood; for they have not received the Word, through whom it is offered
to God.1400 Nor, again, do any of the conventicles (synagogæ) of the heretics [offer this].
For some, by maintaining that the Father is different from the Creator, do, when they offer
to Him what belongs to this creation of ours, set Him forth as being covetous of another’s
property, and desirous of what is not His own. Those, again, who maintain that the things
around us originated from apostasy, ignorance, and passion, do, while offering unto Him
the fruits of ignorance, passion, and apostasy, sin against their Father, rather subjecting
Him to insult than giving Him thanks. But how can they be consistent with themselves,
[when they say] that the bread over which thanks have been given is the body of their
Lord,1401 and the cup His blood, if they do not call Himself the Son of the Creator of the
world, that is, His Word, through whom the wood fructifies, and the fountains gush forth,
and the earth gives “first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.”1402</p>
<p>5. Then, again, how can they say that the flesh, which is nourished with the body of the
Lord and with His blood, goes to corruption, and does not partake of life? Let them, therefore,
either alter their opinion, or cease from offering the things just mentioned.1403 But our

and Harvey the latter. If the first reading be chosen, the translation will be, “the Word who is offered to God,”
implying, according to Massuet, that the body of Christ is really offered as a sacrifice in the Eucharist; if the
second reading be followed, the translation will be as above. [Massuet’s idea is no more to be found, even in his
text, than Luther’s or Calvin’s. The crucial point is, how offered? One may answer “figuratively,” “corporally,”
“mystically,” or otherwise. Irenæus gives no answer in this place. But see below.]</note>

opinion is in accordance with the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn establishes our
opinion. For we offer to Him His own, announcing consistently the fellowship and union
of the flesh and Spirit.1404 For as the bread, which is produced from the earth, when it receives
the invocation of God, is no longer common bread,1405 but the Eucharist, consisting of two
realities, earthly and heavenly; so also our bodies, when they receive the Eucharist, are no
longer corruptible, having the hope of the resurrection to eternity.</p>
<p>6. Now we make offering to Him, not as though He stood in need of it, but rendering
thanks for His gift,1406 and thus sanctifying what has been created. For even as God does
not need our possessions, so do we need to offer something to God; as Solomon says: “He
that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord.”1407 For God, who stands in need of
nothing, takes our good works to Himself for this purpose, that He may grant us a recompense
of His own good things, as our Lord says: “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive
the kingdom prepared for you. For I was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat: I was thirsty,
and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me; sick,
and ye visited Me; in prison, and ye came to Me.”1408 As, therefore, He does not stand in
need of these [services], yet does desire that we should render them for our own benefit,
lest we be unfruitful; so did the Word give to the people that very precept as to the making
of oblations, although He stood in no need of them, that they might learn to serve God: thus
is it, therefore, also His will that we, too, should offer a gift at the altar, frequently and without
intermission. The altar, then, is in heaven1409 (for towards that place are our prayers and
oblations directed); the temple likewise [is there], as John says in the Apocalypse, “And the
temple of God was opened:”1410 the tabernacle also: “For, behold,” He says, “the tabernacle
of God, in which He will dwell with men.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1404 That is, according to Harvey, “while we offer to Him His own creatures of bread and wine, we tell forth
the fellowship of flesh with spirit; i.e., that the flesh of every child of man is receptive of the Spirit.” The words

be the types of others still superior and unknown; nor can we, without absolute
madness, maintain that God is known to us only as the type of a still unknown
and superior being.</head>
<p>1. Now the gifts, oblations, and all the sacrifices, did the people receive in a figure, as
was shown to Moses in the mount, from one and the same God, whose name is now glorified
in the Church among all nations. But it is congruous that those earthly things, indeed, which
are spread all around us, should be types of the celestial, being [both], however, created by
the same God. For in no other way could He assimilate an image of spiritual things [to suit
our comprehension]. But to allege that those things which are super-celestial and spiritual,
and, as far as we are concerned, invisible and ineffable, are in their turn the types of celestial
things and of another Pleroma, and [to say] that God is the image of another Father, is to
play the part both of wanderers from the truth, and of absolutely foolish and stupid persons.
For, as I have repeatedly shown, such persons will find it necessary to be continually finding
out types of types, and images of images, and will never [be able to] fix their minds on one
and the true God. For their imaginations range beyond God, they having in their hearts
surpassed the Master Himself, being indeed in idea elated and exalted above [Him], but in
reality turning away from the true God.</p>
<p>2. To these persons one may with justice say (as Scripture itself suggests), To what distance
above God do ye lift up your imaginations, O ye rashly elated men? Ye have heard
“that the heavens are meted out in the palm of [His] hand:”1411 tell me the measure, and
recount the endless multitude of cubits, explain to me the fulness, the breadth, the length,
the height, the beginning and end of the measurement,—things which the heart of man
understands not, neither does it comprehend them. For the heavenly treasuries are indeed
great: God cannot be measured in the heart, and incomprehensible is He in the mind; He
who holds the earth in the hollow of His hand. Who perceives the measure of His right
hand? Who knoweth His finger? Or who doth understand His hand,—that hand which
measures immensity; that hand which, by its own measure, spreads out the measure of the
heavens, and which comprises in its hollow the earth with the abysses; which contains in
itself the breadth, and length, and the deep below, and the height above of the whole creation;
which is seen, which is heard and understood, and which is invisible? And for this reason
God is “above all principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named,”1412
of all things which have been created and established. He it is who fills the heavens, and
views the abysses, who is also present with every one of us. For he says, “Am I a God at hand,
and not a God afar off? If any man is hid in secret places, shall I not see him?”1413 For His

hand lays hold of all things, and that it is which illumines the heavens, and lightens also the
things which are under the heavens, and trieth the reins and the hearts, is also present in
hidden things, and in our secret [thoughts], and does openly nourish and preserve us.</p>
<p>3. But if man comprehends not the fulness and the greatness of His hand, how shall any
one be able to understand or know in his heart so great a God? Yet, as if they had now
measured and thoroughly investigated Him, and explored Him on every side,1414 they feign
that beyond Him there exists another Pleroma of Æons, and another Father; certainly not
looking up to celestial things, but truly descending into a profound abyss (Bythus) of madness;
maintaining that their Father extends only to the border of those things which are beyond
the Pleroma, but that, on the other hand, the Demiurge does not reach so far as the Pleroma;
and thus they represent neither of them as being perfect and comprehending all things. For
the former will be defective in regard to the whole world formed outside of the Pleroma,
and the latter in respect of that [ideal] world which was formed within the Pleroma; and
[therefore] neither of these can be the God of all. But that no one can fully declare the
goodness of God from the things made by Him, is a point evident to all. And that His
greatness is not defective, but contains all things, and extends even to us, and is with us,
every one will confess who entertains worthy conceptions of God.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—That one God formed all things in the world, by means of the
Word and the Holy Spirit: and that although He is to us in this life invisible and
incomprehensible, nevertheless He is not unknown; inasmuch as His works do
declare Him, and His Word has shown that in many modes He may be seen and
known.</head>
<p>1. As regards His greatness, therefore, it is not possible to know God, for it is impossible
that the Father can be measured; but as regards His love (for this it is which leads us to God
by His Word), when we obey Him, we do always learn that there is so great a God, and that
it is He who by Himself has established, and selected, and adorned, and contains all things;
and among the all things, both ourselves and this our world. We also then were made, along
with those things which are contained by Him. And this is He of whom the Scripture says,
“And God formed man, taking clay of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of
life.”1415 It was not angels, therefore, who made us, nor who formed us, neither had angels
power to make an image of God, nor any one else, except the Word of the Lord, nor any
Power remotely distant from the Father of all things. For God did not stand in need of these
[beings], in order to the accomplishing of what He had Himself determined with Himself
beforehand should be done, as if He did not possess His own hands. For with Him were al-
ways present the Word and Wisdom, the Son and the Spirit, by whom and in whom, freely
and spontaneously, He made all things, to whom also He speaks, saying, “Let Us make man
after Our image and likeness;”1416 He taking from Himself the substance of the creatures
[formed], and the pattern of things made, and the type of all the adornments in the world.</p>
<p>2. Truly, then, the Scripture declared, which says, “First1417 of all believe that there is
one God, who has established all things, and completed them, and having caused that from
what had no being, all things should come into existence:” He who contains all things, and
is Himself contained by no one. Rightly also has Malachi said among the prophets: “Is it
not one God who hath established us? Have we not all one Father?”1418 In accordance with
this, too, does the apostle say, “There is one God, the Father, who is above all, and in us
all.”1419 Likewise does the Lord also say: “All things are delivered to Me by My Father;”1420
manifestly by Him who made all things; for He did not deliver to Him the things of another,
but His own. But in all things [it is implied that] nothing has been kept back [from Him],
and for this reason the same person is the Judge of the living and the dead; “having the key

of David: He shall open, and no man shall shut: He shall shut, and no man shall open.”1421
For no one was able, either in heaven or in earth, or under the earth, to open the book of
the Father, or to behold Him, with the exception of the Lamb who was slain, and who redeemed
us with His own blood, receiving power over all things from the same God who
made all things by the Word, and adorned them by [His] Wisdom, when “the Word was
made flesh;” that even as the Word of God had the sovereignty in the heavens, so also might
He have the sovereignty in earth, inasmuch as [He was] a righteous man, “who did no sin,
neither was there found guile in His mouth;”1422 and that He might have the pre-eminence
over those things which are under the earth, He Himself being made “the first-begotten of
the dead;”1423 and that all things, as I have already said, might behold their King; and that
the paternal light might meet with and rest upon the flesh of our Lord, and come to us from
His resplendent flesh, and that thus man might attain to immortality, having been invested
with the paternal light.</p>
<p>3. I have also largely demonstrated, that the Word, namely the Son, was always with the
Father; and that Wisdom also, which is the Spirit, was present with Him, anterior to all
creation, He declares by Solomon: “God by Wisdom founded the earth, and by understanding
hath He established the heaven. By His knowledge the depths burst forth, and the clouds
dropped down the dew.”1424 And again: “The Lord created me the beginning of His ways
in His work: He set me up from everlasting, in the beginning, before He made the earth,
before He established the depths, and before the fountains of waters gushed forth; before
the mountains were made strong, and before all the hills, He brought me forth.”1425 And
again: “When He prepared the heaven, I was with Him, and when He established the fountains
of the deep; when He made the foundations of the earth strong, I was with Him preparing
[them]. I was He in whom He rejoiced, and throughout all time I was daily glad before
His face, when He rejoiced at the completion of the world, and was delighted in the sons of
men.”1426</p>
<p>4. There is therefore one God, who by the Word and Wisdom created and arranged all
things; but this is the Creator (Demiurge) who has granted this world to the human race,
and who, as regards His greatness, is indeed unknown to all who have been made by Him
(for no man has searched out His height, either among the ancients who have gone to their

rest, or any of those who are now alive); but as regards His love, He is always known through
Him by whose means He ordained all things. Now this is His Word, our Lord Jesus Christ,
who in the last times was made a man among men, that He might join the end to the beginning,
that is, man to God. Wherefore the prophets, receiving the prophetic gift from the
same Word, announced His advent according to the flesh, by which the blending and
communion of God and man took place according to the good pleasure of the Father, the
Word of God foretelling from the beginning that God should be seen by men, and hold
converse with them upon earth, should confer with them, and should be present with His
own creation, saving it, and becoming capable of being perceived by it, and freeing us from
the hands of all that hate us, that is, from every spirit of wickedness; and causing us to serve
Him in holiness and righteousness all our days,1427 in order that man, having embraced
the Spirit of God, might pass into the glory of the Father.</p>
<p>5. These things did the prophets set forth in a prophetical manner; but they did not, as
some allege, [proclaim] that He who was seen by the prophets was a different [God], the
Father of all being invisible. Yet this is what those [heretics] declare, who are altogether
ignorant of the nature of prophecy. For prophecy is a prediction of things future, that is, a
setting forth beforehand of those things which shall be afterwards. The prophets, then, indicated
beforehand that God should be seen by men; as the Lord also says, “Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God.”1428 But in respect to His greatness, and His wonderful
glory, “no man shall see God and live,”1429 for the Father is incomprehensible; but in regard
to His love, and kindness, and as to His infinite power, even this He grants to those who
love Him, that is, to see God, which thing the prophets did also predict. “For those things
that are impossible with men, are possible with God.”1430 For man does not see God by his
own powers; but when He pleases He is seen by men, by whom He wills, and when He wills,
and as He wills. For God is powerful in all things, having been seen at that time indeed,
prophetically through the Spirit, and seen, too, adoptively through the Son; and He shall
also be seen paternally in the kingdom of heaven, the Spirit truly preparing man in the
Son1431 of God, and the Son leading him to the Father, while the Father, too, confers [upon
him] incorruption for eternal life, which comes to every one from the fact of his seeing God.
For as those who see the light are within the light, and partake of its brilliancy; even so, those
who see God are in God, and receive of His splendour. But [His] splendour vivifies them;
those, therefore, who see God, do receive life. And for this reason, He, [although] beyond

<pb n="1219"/>
comprehension, and boundless and invisible, rendered Himself visible, and comprehensible,
and within the capacity of those who believe, that He might vivify those who receive and
behold Him through faith.1432 For as His greatness is past finding out, so also His goodness
is beyond expression; by which having been seen, He bestows life upon those who see Him.
It is not possible to live apart from life, and the means of life is found in fellowship with
God; but fellowship with God is to know God, and to enjoy His goodness.</p>
<p>6. Men therefore shall see God, that they may live, being made immortal by that sight,
and attaining even unto God; which, as I have already said, was declared figuratively by the
prophets, that God should be seen by men who bear His Spirit [in them], and do always
wait patiently for His coming. As also Moses says in Deuteronomy, “We shall see in that
day that God will talk to man, and he shall live.”1433 For certain of these men used to see
the prophetic Spirit and His active influences poured forth for all kinds of gifts; others, again,
[beheld] the advent of the Lord, and that dispensation which obtained from the beginning,
by which He accomplished the will of the Father with regard to things both celestial and
terrestrial; and others [beheld] paternal glories adapted to the times, and to those who saw
and who heard them then, and to all who were subsequently to hear them. Thus, therefore,
was God revealed; for God the Father is shown forth through all these [operations], the
Spirit indeed working, and the Son ministering, while the Father was approving, and man’s
salvation being accomplished. As He also declares through Hosea the prophet: “I,” He says,
“have multiplied visions, and have used similitudes by the ministry (in manibus) of the
prophets.”1434 But the apostle expounded this very passage, when he said, “Now there are
diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are differences of ministrations, but the
same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all
in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.”1435 But as
He who worketh all things in all is God, [as to the points] of what nature and how great He
is, [God] is invisible and indescribable to all things which have been made by Him, but He
is by no means unknown: for all things learn through His Word that there is one God the
Father, who contains all things, and who grants existence to all, as is written in the Gospel:
“No man hath seen God at any time, except the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
the Father; He has declared [Him].”1436</p>
<p>7. Therefore the Son of the Father declares [Him] from the beginning, inasmuch as He
was with the Father from the beginning, who did also show to the human race prophetic

visions, and diversities of gifts, and His own ministrations, and the glory of the Father, in
regular order and connection, at the fitting time for the benefit [of mankind]. For where
there is a regular succession, there is also fixedness; and where fixedness, there suitability
to the period; and where suitability, there also utility. And for this reason did the Word become
the dispenser of the paternal grace for the benefit of men, for whom He made such
great dispensations, revealing God indeed to men, but presenting man to God, and preserving
at the same time the invisibility of the Father, lest man should at any time become a despiser
of God, and that he should always possess something towards which he might advance;
but, on the other hand, revealing God to men through many dispensations, lest man, falling
away from God altogether, should cease to exist. For the glory of God is a living man; and
the life of man consists in beholding God. For if the manifestation of God which is made
by means of the creation, affords life to all living in the earth, much more does that revelation
of the Father which comes through the Word, give life to those who see God.</p>
<p>8. Inasmuch, then, as the Spirit of God pointed out by the prophets things to come,
forming and adapting us beforehand for the purpose of our being made subject to God, but
it was still a future thing that man, through the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit, should see
[God], it necessarily behoved those through whose instrumentality future things were announced,
to see God, whom they intimated as to be seen by men; in order that God, and
the Son of God, and the Son, and the Father, should not only be prophetically announced,
but that He should also be seen by all His members who are sanctified and instructed in the
things of God, that man might be disciplined beforehand and previously exercised for a reception
into that glory which shall afterwards be revealed in those who love God. For the
prophets used not to prophesy in word alone, but in visions also, and in their mode of life,
and in the actions which they performed, according to the suggestions of the Spirit. After
this invisible manner, therefore, did they see God, as also Esaias says, “I have seen with mine
eyes the King, the Lord of hosts,”1437 pointing out that man should behold God with his
eyes, and hear His voice. In this manner, therefore, did they also see the Son of God as a
man conversant with men, while they prophesied what was to happen, saying that He who
was not come as yet was present proclaiming also the impassible as subject to suffering, and
declaring that He who was then in heaven had descended into the dust of death.1438
Moreover, [with regard to] the other arrangements concerning the summing up that He
should make, some of these they beheld through visions, others they proclaimed by word,
while others they indicated typically by means of [outward] action, seeing visibly those
things which were to be seen; heralding by word of mouth those which should be heard;
and performing by actual operation what should take place by action; but [at the same time]
<note type="footnote">1437 Isa. vi. 5.</note>

<pb n="1221"/>
announcing all prophetically. Wherefore also Moses declared that God was indeed a consuming
fire1439 (igneum) to the people that transgressed the law, and threatened that God
would bring upon them a day of fire; but to those who had the fear of God he said, “The
Lord God is merciful and gracious, and long-suffering, and of great commiseration, and
true, and keeps justice and mercy for thousands, forgiving unrighteousness, and transgressions,
and sins.”1440</p>
<p>9. And the Word spake to Moses, appearing before him, “just as any one might speak
to his friend.”1441 But Moses desired to see Him openly who was speaking with him, and
was thus addressed: “Stand in the deep place of the rock, and with My hand I will cover
thee. But when My splendour shall pass by, then thou shalt see My back parts, but My face
thou shalt not see: for no man sees My face, and shall live.”1442 Two facts are thus signified:
that it is impossible for man to see God; and that, through the wisdom of God, man shall
see Him in the last times, in the depth of a rock, that is, in His coming as a man. And for
this reason did He [the Lord] confer with him face to face on the top of a mountain, Elias
being also present, as the Gospel relates,1443 He thus making good in the end the ancient
promise.</p>
<p>10. The prophets, therefore, did not openly behold the actual face of God, but [they saw]
the dispensations and the mysteries through which man should afterwards see God. As was
also said to Elias: “Thou shalt go forth tomorrow, and stand in the presence of the Lord;
and, behold, a wind great and strong, which shall rend the mountains, and break the rocks
in pieces before the Lord. And the Lord [was] not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake,
but the Lord [was] not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the
Lord [was] not in the fire; and after the fire a scarcely audible voice” (vox auræ tenuis).1444
For by such means was the prophet—very indignant, because of the transgression of the
people and the slaughter of the prophets—both taught to act in a more gentle manner; and
the Lord’s advent as a man was pointed out, that it should be subsequent to that law which
was given by Moses, mild and tranquil, in which He would neither break the bruised reed,
nor quench the smoking flax.1445 The mild and peaceful repose of His kingdom was indicated
likewise. For, after the wind which rends the mountains, and after the earthquake, and after
the fire, come the tranquil and peaceful times of His kingdom, in which the spirit of God

does, in the most gentle manner, vivify and increase mankind. This, too, was made still
clearer by Ezekiel, that the prophets saw the dispensations of God in part, but not actually
God Himself. For when this man had seen the vision1446 of God, and the cherubim, and
their wheels, and when he had recounted the mystery of the whole of that progression, and
had beheld the likeness of a throne above them, and upon the throne a likeness as of the
figure of a man, and the things which were upon his loins as the figure of amber, and what
was below like the sight of fire, and when he set forth all the rest of the vision of the thrones,
lest any one might happen to think that in those [visions] he had actually seen God, he added:
“This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of God.”1447</p>
<p>11. If, then, neither Moses, nor Elias, nor Ezekiel, who had all many celestial visions,
did see God; but if what they did see were similitudes of the splendour of the Lord, and
prophecies of things to come; it is manifest that the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also
the Lord said, “No man hath seen God at any time.”1448 But His Word, as He Himself willed
it, and for the benefit of those who beheld, did show the Father’s brightness, and explained
His purposes (as also the Lord said: “The only-begotten God,1449 which is in the bosom of
the Father, He hath declared [Him];” and He does Himself also interpret the Word of the
Father as being rich and great); not in one figure, nor in one character, did He appear to
those seeing Him, but according to the reasons and effects aimed at in His dispensations,
as it is written in Daniel. For at one time He was seen with those who were around Ananias,
Azarias, Mishael, as present with them in the furnace of fire, in the burning, and preserving
them from [the effects of] fire: “And the appearance of the fourth,” it is said, “was like to
the Son of God.”1450 At another time [He is represented as] “a stone cut out of the mountain
without hands,”1451 and as smiting all temporal kingdoms, and as blowing them away
(ventilans ea), and as Himself filling all the earth. Then, too, is this same individual beheld
as the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, and drawing near to the Ancient of Days,
and receiving from Him all power and glory, and a kingdom. “His dominion,” it is said, “is
an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom shall not perish.”1452 John also, the Lord’s disciple,
when beholding the sacerdotal and glorious advent of His kingdom, says in the Apocalypse:

“I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And, being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
and in the midst of the candlesticks One like unto the Son of man, clothed with a
garment reaching to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; and His head and
His hairs were white, as white as wool, and as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire;
and His feet like unto fine brass, as if He burned in a furnace. And His voice [was] as the
voice of waters; and He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth went a
sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.”1453
For in these words He sets forth something of the glory [which He has received] from His
Father, as [where He makes mention of] the head; something in reference to the priestly
office also, as in the case of the long garment reaching to the feet. And this was the reason
why Moses vested the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end [of
all things], as [where He speaks of] the fine brass burning in the fire, which denotes the
power of faith, and the continuing instant in prayer, because of the consuming fire which
is to come at the end of time. But when John could not endure the sight (for he says, “I fell
at his feet as dead;”1454 that what was written might come to pass: “No man sees God, and
shall live”1455), and the Word reviving him, and reminding him that it was He upon whose
bosom he had leaned at supper, when he put the question as to who should betray Him,
declared: “I am the first and the last, and He who liveth, and was dead, and behold I am
alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of hell.” And after these things, seeing
the same Lord in a second vision, he says: “For I saw in the midst of the throne, and of the
four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as it had been slain,
having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all
the earth.”1456 And again, he says, speaking of this very same Lamb: “And behold a white
horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth
He judge and make war. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many
crowns; having a name written, that no man knoweth but Himself: and He was girded
around with a vesture sprinkled with blood: and His name is called The Word of God. And
the armies of heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in pure white linen. And
out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He may smite the nations; and He shall
rule (pascet) them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of
the wrath of God Almighty. And He hath upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name
written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.”1457 Thus does the Word of God always preserve

the outlines, as it were, of things to come, and points out to men the various forms (species),
as it were, of the dispensations of the Father, teaching us the things pertaining to God.</p>
<p>12. However, it was not by means of visions alone which were seen, and words which
were proclaimed, but also in actual works, that He was beheld by the prophets, in order that
through them He might prefigure and show forth future events beforehand. For this reason
did Hosea the prophet take “a wife of whoredoms,” prophesying by means of the action,
“that in committing fornication the earth should fornicate from the Lord,”1458 that is, the
men who are upon the earth; and from men of this stamp it will be God’s good pleasure to
take out1459 a Church which shall be sanctified by fellowship with His Son, just as that woman
was sanctified by intercourse with the prophet. And for this reason, Paul declares that the
“unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband.”1460 Then again, the prophet names
his children, “Not having obtained mercy,” and “Not a people,”1461 in order that, as says
the apostle, “what was not a people may become a people; and she who did not obtain mercy
may obtain mercy. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said, This is not
a people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.”1462 That which had been
done typically through his actions by the prophet, the apostle proves to have been done
truly by Christ in the Church. Thus, too, did Moses also take to wife an Ethiopian woman,
whom he thus made an Israelitish one, showing by anticipation that the wild olive tree is
grafted into the cultivated olive, and made to partake of its fatness. For as He who was born
Christ according to the flesh, had indeed to be sought after by the people in order to be slain,
but was to be set free in Egypt, that is, among the Gentiles, to sanctify those who were there
in a state of infancy, from whom also He perfected His Church in that place (for Egypt was
Gentile from the beginning, as was Ethiopia also); for this reason, by means of the marriage
of Moses, was shown forth the marriage of the Word;1463 and by means of the Ethiopian
bride, the Church taken from among the Gentiles was made manifest; and those who do
detract from, accuse, and deride it, shall not be pure. For they shall be full of leprosy, and
expelled from the camp of the righteous. Thus also did Rahab the harlot, while condemning
herself, inasmuch as she was a Gentile, guilty of all sins, nevertheless receive the three

and the redemption and exodus of the people from Egypt,—when He said, “The

<head>Chapter XXI.—Abraham’s faith was identical with ours; this faith was prefigured
by the words and actions of the old patriarchs.</head>
<p>1. But that our faith was also prefigured in Abraham, and that he was the patriarch of
our faith, and, as it were, the prophet of it, the apostle has very fully taught, when he says
in the Epistle to the Galatians: “He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even
as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know ye
therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. But the
Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, announced beforehand
unto Abraham, that in him all nations should be blessed. So then they which be of faith shall
be blessed with faithful Abraham.”1466 For which [reasons the apostle] declared that this
man was not only the prophet of faith, but also the father of those who from among the
Gentiles believe in Jesus Christ, because his faith and ours are one and the same: for he believed
in things future, as if they were already accomplished, because of the promise of God;
and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of God, behold through faith that
inheritance [laid up for us] in the [future] kingdom.</p>
<p>2. The history of Isaac, too, is not without a symbolical character. For in the Epistle to
the Romans, the apostle declares: “Moreover, when Rebecca had conceived by one, even by
our father Isaac,” she received answer1467 from the Word, “that the purpose of God according
to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said unto her, Two
nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people are in thy body; and the one people
shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.”1468 From which it is evident,
that not only [were there] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the children brought
forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two nations; and that the one should be indeed
the greater, but the other the less; that the one also should be under bondage, but the other
free; but [that both should be] of one and the same father. Our God, one and the same, is
also their God, who knows hidden things, who knoweth all things before they can come to
pass; and for this reason has He said, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”1469</p>
<p>3. If any one, again, will look into Jacob’s actions, he shall find them not destitute of
meaning, but full of import with regard to the dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his
birth, since he laid hold on his brother’s heel,1470 he was called Jacob, that is, the supplanter—
one who holds, but is not held; binding the feet, but not being bound; striving and

conquering; grasping in his hand his adversary’s heel, that is, victory. For to this end was
the Lord born, the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand, of whom also John says in
the Apocalypse: “He went forth conquering, that He should conquer.”1471 In the next place,
[Jacob] received the rights of the first-born, when his brother looked on them with contempt;
even as also the younger nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when the elder
nation rejected Him, saying, “We have no king but Cæsar.”1472 But in Christ every blessing
[is summed up], and therefore the latter people has snatched away the blessings of the former
from the Father, just as Jacob took away the blessing of this Esau. For which cause his
brother suffered the plots and persecutions of a brother, just as the Church suffers this selfsame
thing from the Jews. In a foreign country were the twelve tribes born, the race of Israel,
inasmuch as Christ was also, in a strange country, to generate the twelve-pillared foundation
of the Church. Various coloured sheep were allotted to this Jacob as his wages; and the wages
of Christ are human beings, who from various and diverse nations come together into one
cohort of faith, as the Father promised Him, saying, “Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the
heathen for Thine inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.”1473
And as from the multitude of his sons the prophets of the Lord [afterwards] arose, there
was every necessity that Jacob should beget sons from the two sisters, even as Christ did
from the two laws of one and the same Father; and in like manner also from the handmaids,
indicating that Christ should raise up sons of God, both from freemen and from slaves after
the flesh, bestowing upon all, in the same manner, the gift of the Spirit, who vivifies us.1474
But he (Jacob) did all things for the sake of the younger, she who had the handsome eyes,1475
Rachel, who prefigured the Church, for which Christ endured patiently; who at that time,
indeed, by means of His patriarchs and prophets, was prefiguring and declaring beforehand
future things, fulfilling His part by anticipation in the dispensations of God, and accustoming
His inheritance to obey God, and to pass through the world as in a state of pilgrimage, to
follow His word, and to indicate beforehand things to come. For with God there is nothing
without purpose or due signification.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Christ did not come for the sake of the men of one age only, but
for all who, living righteously and piously, had believed upon Him; and for those,
too, who shall believe.</head>
<p>1. Now in the last days, when the fulness of the time of liberty had arrived, the Word
Himself did by Himself “wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion,”1476 when He washed
the disciples’ feet with His own hands.1477 For this is the end of the human race inheriting
God; that as in the beginning, by means of our first [parents], we were all brought into
bondage, by being made subject to death; so at last, by means of the New Man, all who from
the beginning [were His] disciples, having been cleansed and washed from things pertaining
to death, should come to the life of God. For He who washed the feet of the disciples sanctified
the entire body, and rendered it clean. For this reason, too, He administered food to them
in a recumbent posture, indicating that those who were lying in the earth were they to whom
He came to impart life. As Jeremiah declares, “The holy Lord remembered His dead Israel,
who slept in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them to make known to them His
salvation, that they might be saved.”1478 For this reason also were the eyes of the disciples
weighed down when Christ’s passion was approaching; and when, in the first instance, the
Lord found them sleeping, He let it pass,—thus indicating the patience of God in regard to
the state of slumber in which men lay; but coming the second time, He aroused them, and
made them stand up, in token that His passion is the arousing of His sleeping disciples, on
whose account “He also descended into the lower parts of the earth,”1479 to behold with
His eyes the state of those who were resting from their labours,1480 in reference to whom
He did also declare to the disciples: “Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see
and hear what ye do see and hear.”1481</p>
<p>2. For it was not merely for those who believed on Him in the time of Tiberius Cæsar
that Christ came, nor did the Father exercise His providence for the men only who are now
alive, but for all men altogether, who from the beginning, according to their capacity, in
their generation have both feared and loved God, and practised justice and piety towards
their neighbours, and have earnestly desired to see Christ, and to hear His voice. Wherefore
He shall, at His second coming, first rouse from their sleep all persons of this description,
and shall raise them up, as well as the rest who shall be judged, and give them a place in His
kingdom. For it is truly “one God who” directed the patriarchs towards His dispensations,

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The patriarchs and prophets by pointing out the advent of
Christ, fortified thereby, as it were, the way of posterity to the faith of Christ;
and so the labours of the apostles were lessened inasmuch as they gathered in
the fruits of the labours of others.</head>
<p>1. For which reason the Lord declared to the disciples: “Behold, I say unto you, Lift up
your eyes, and look upon the districts (regiones), for they are white [already] to harvest. For
the harvest-man receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both he that
soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. For in this is the saying true, that one
soweth and another reapeth. For I have sent you forward to reap that whereon ye bestowed
no labour; other men have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.”1483 Who, then,
are they that have laboured, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? It is clear
that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured our faith, and disseminated
through the earth the advent of the Son of God, who and what He should be: so that posterity,
possessing the fear of God, might easily accept the advent of Christ, having been instructed
by the prophets. And for this reason it was, that when Joseph became aware that Mary was
with child, and was minded to put her away privily, the angel said to him in sleep: “Fear not
to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. For
she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people
from their sins.”1484 And exhorting him [to this], he added: “Now all this has been done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a
virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel;”
thus influencing him by the words of the prophet, and warding off blame from
Mary, pointing out that it was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who
should give birth to Emmanuel. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond all doubt,
he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience in regard to all the rest of the education
of Christ, undertaking a journey into Egypt and back again, and then a removal to Nazareth.
[For this reason,] those who knew not the Scriptures nor the promise of God, nor the dispensation
of Christ, at last called him the father of the child. For this reason, too, did the
Lord Himself read at Capernaum the prophecies of Isaiah:1485 “The Spirit of the Lord is
upon Me, because He hath anointed Me; to preach the Gospel to the poor hath He sent Me,
to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind.”1486
At the same time, showing that it was He Himself who had been foretold by Esaias the
prophet, He said to them: “This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.”</p>

<p>2. For this reason, also, Philip, when he had discovered the eunuch of the Ethiopians’
queen reading these words which had been written: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in His humiliation
His judgment was taken away;”1487 and all the rest which the prophet proceeded to relate
in regard to His passion and His coming in the flesh, and how He was dishonoured by those
who did not believe Him; easily persuaded him to believe on Him, that He was Christ Jesus,
who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and suffered whatsoever the prophet had predicted,
and that He was the Son of God, who gives eternal life to men. And immediately when
[Philip] had baptized him, he departed from him. For nothing else [but baptism] was
wanting to him who had been already instructed by the prophets: he was not ignorant of
God the Father, nor of the rules as to the [proper] manner of life, but was merely ignorant
of the advent of the Son of God, which, when he had become acquainted with, in a short
space of time, he went on his way rejoicing, to be the herald in Ethiopia of Christ’s advent.
Therefore Philip had no great labour to go through with regard to this man, because he was
already prepared in the fear of God by the prophets. For this reason, too, did the apostles,
collecting the sheep which had perished of the house of Israel, and discoursing to them from
the Scriptures, prove that this crucified Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God; and
they persuaded a great multitude, who, however, [already] possessed the fear of God. And
there were, in one day, baptized three, and four, and five thousand men.1488</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—The conversion of the Gentiles was more difficult than that of
the Jews; the labours of those apostles, therefore who engaged in the former task,
were greater than those who undertook the latter.</head>
<p>1. Wherefore also Paul, since he was the apostle of the Gentiles, says, “I laboured more
than they all.”1489 For the instruction of the former, [viz., the Jews,] was an easy task, because
they could allege proofs from the Scriptures, and because they, who were in the habit of
hearing Moses and the prophets, did also readily receive the First-begotten of the dead, and
the Prince of the life of God, —Him who, by the spreading forth of hands, did destroy
Amalek, and vivify man from the wound of the serpent, by means of faith which was [exercised]
towards Him. As I have pointed out in the preceding book, the apostle did, in the
first place, instruct the Gentiles to depart from the superstition of idols, and to worship one
God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Framer of the whole creation; and that His
Son was His Word, by whom He founded all things; and that He, in the last times, was made
a man among men; that He reformed the human race, but destroyed and conquered the
enemy of man, and gave to His handiwork victory against the adversary. But although they
who were of the circumcision still did not obey the words of God, for they were despisers,
yet they were previously instructed not to commit adultery, nor fornication, nor theft, nor
fraud; and that whatsoever things are done to our neighbours’ prejudice, were evil, and detested
by God. Wherefore also they did readily agree to abstain from these things, because
they had been thus instructed.</p>
<p>2. But they were bound to teach the Gentiles also this very thing, that works of such a
nature were wicked, prejudicial, and useless, and destructive to those who engaged in them.
Wherefore he who had received the apostolate to the Gentiles,1490 did labour more than
those who preached the Son of God among them of the circumcision. For they were assisted
by the Scriptures, which the Lord confirmed and fulfilled, in coming such as He had been
announced; but here, [in the case of the Gentiles,] there was a certain foreign erudition, and
a new doctrine [to be received, namely], that the gods of the nations not only were no gods
at all, but even the idols of demons; and that there is one God, who is “above all principality,
and dominion, and power, and every name which is named;”1491 and that His Word, invisible
by nature, was made palpable and visible among men, and did descend “to death, even the
death of the cross;”1492 also, that they who believe in Him shall be incorruptible and not
subject to suffering, and shall receive the kingdom of heaven. These things, too, were preached

to the Gentiles by word, without [the aid of] the Scriptures: wherefore, also, they who
preached among the Gentiles underwent greater labour. But, on the other hand, the faith
of the Gentiles is proved to be of a more noble description, since they followed the word of
God without the instruction [derived] from the [sacred] writings (sine instructione literarum).</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Both covenants were prefigured in Abraham, and in the labour
of Tamar; there was, however, but one and the same God to each covenant.</head>
<p>1. For thus it had behoved the sons of Abraham [to be], whom God has raised up to
him from the stones,1493 and caused to take a place beside him who was made the chief and
the forerunner of our faith (who did also receive the covenant of circumcision, after that
justification by faith which had pertained to him, when he was yet in uncircumcision, so
that in him both covenants might be prefigured, that he might be the father of all who follow
the Word of God, and who sustain a life of pilgrimage in this world, that is, of those who
from among the circumcision and of those from among the uncircumcision are faithful,
even as also “Christ1494 is the chief corner-stone” sustaining all things); and He gathered
into the one faith of Abraham those who, from either covenant, are eligible for God’s
building. But this faith which is in uncircumcision, as connecting the end with the beginning,
has been made [both] the first and the last. For, as I have shown, it existed in Abraham
antecedently to circumcision, as it also did in the rest of the righteous who pleased God:
and in these last times, it again sprang up among mankind through the coming of the Lord.
But circumcision and the law of works occupied the intervening period.1495</p>
<p>2. This fact is indeed set forth by many other [occurrences], but typically by [the history
of] Thamar, Judah’s daughter-in-law.1496 For when she had conceived twins, one of them
put forth his hand first; and as the midwife supposed that he was the first-born, she bound
a scarlet token on his hand. But after this had been done, and he had drawn back his hand,
his brother Phares came forth the first; then, after him, Zara, upon whom was the scarlet
line, [was born] the second: the Scripture clearly pointing out that people which possessed
the scarlet sign, that is, faith in a state of circumcision, which was shown beforehand, indeed,
in the patriarchs first; but after that withdrawn, that his brother might be born; and also, in
like manner, him who was the elder, as being born in the second place, [him] who was distinguished
by the scarlet token which was [fastened] on him, that is, the passion of the Just
One, which was prefigured from the beginning in Abel, and described by the prophets, but
perfected in the last times in the Son of God.</p>

in a paternal manner, and others prefigured by the prophets in a legal one, but others, described
after the form of Christ, by those who have received the adoption; while in one God
are all things shown forth. For although Abraham was one, he did in himself prefigure the
two covenants, in which some indeed have sown, while others have reaped; for it is said,
“In this is the saying true, that it is one ‘people’ who sows, but another who shall reap;”1497
but it is one God who bestows things suitable upon both—seed to the sower, but bread for
the reaper to eat. Just as it is one that planteth, and another who watereth, but one God who
giveth the increase.1498 For the patriarchs and prophets sowed the word [concerning] Christ,
but the Church reaped, that is, received the fruit. For this reason, too, do these very men
(the prophets) also pray to have a dwelling-place in it, as Jeremiah says, “Who will give me
in the desert the last dwelling-place?”1499 in order that both the sower and the reaper may
rejoice together in the kingdom of Christ, who is present with all those who were from the
beginning approved by God, who granted them His Word to be present with them.1500</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ; the true exposition
of the Scriptures is to be found in the Church alone.</head>
<p>1. If any one, therefore, reads the Scriptures with attention, he will find in them an account
of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the new calling (vocationis). For Christ is the
treasure which was hid in the field,1501 that is, in this world (for “the field is the world”1502);
but the treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ, since He was pointed out by means of types
and parables. Hence His human nature could not1503 be understood, prior to the consummation
of those things which had been predicted, that is, the advent of Christ. And therefore
it was said to Daniel the prophet: “Shut up the words, and seal the book even to the time of
consummation, until many learn, and knowledge be completed. For at that time, when the
dispersion shall be accomplished, they shall know all these things.”1504 But Jeremiah also
says, “In the last days they shall understand these things.”1505 For every prophecy, before
its fulfilment, is to men [full of] enigmas and ambiguities. But when the time has arrived,
and the prediction has come to pass, then the prophecies have a clear and certain exposition.
And for this reason, indeed, when at this present time the law is read to the Jews, it is like
a fable; for they do not possess the explanation of all things pertaining to the advent of the
Son of God, which took place in human nature; but when it is read by the Christians, it is
a treasure, hid indeed in a field, but brought to light by the cross of Christ, and explained,
both enriching the understanding of men, and showing forth the wisdom of God and declaring
His dispensations with regard to man, and forming the kingdom of Christ beforehand,
and preaching by anticipation the inheritance of the holy Jerusalem, and proclaiming beforehand
that the man who loves God shall arrive at such excellency as even to see God, and
hear His word, and from the hearing of His discourse be glorified to such an extent, that
others cannot behold the glory of his countenance, as was said by Daniel: “Those who do

Scriptures. For thus it was that the Lord discoursed with the disciples after His resurrection
from the dead, proving to them from the Scriptures themselves “that Christ must suffer,
and enter into His glory, and that remission of sins should be preached in His name
throughout all the world.”1509 And the disciple will be perfected, and [rendered] like the
householder, “who bringeth forth from his treasure things new and old.”1510</p>
<p>2. Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the Church,—those who,
as I have shown, possess the succession from the apostles; those who, together with the
succession of the episcopate, have received the certain gift of truth, according to the good
pleasure of the Father. But [it is also incumbent] to hold in suspicion others who depart
from the primitive succession, and assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever,
[looking upon them] either as heretics of perverse minds, or as schismatics puffed up and
self-pleasing, or again as hypocrites, acting thus for the sake of lucre and vainglory. For all
these have fallen from the truth. And the heretics, indeed, who bring strange fire to the altar
of God— namely, strange doctrines—shall be burned up by the fire from heaven, as were
Nadab and Abiud.1511 But such as rise up in opposition to the truth, and exhort others
against the Church of God, [shall] remain among those in hell (apud inferos), being swallowed
up by an earthquake, even as those who were with Chore, Dathan, and Abiron.1512 But
those who cleave asunder, and separate the unity of the Church, [shall] receive from God
the same punishment as Jeroboam did.1513</p>
<p>3. Those, however, who are believed to be presbyters by many, but serve their own lusts,
and, do not place the fear of God supreme in their hearts, but conduct themselves with
contempt towards others, and are puffed up with the pride of holding the chief seat, and
work evil deeds in secret, saying, “No man sees us,” shall be convicted by the Word, who
does not judge after outward appearance (secundum gloriam), nor looks upon the countenance,
but the heart; and they shall hear those words, to be found in Daniel the prophet: “O
thou seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust perverted thy
heart.1514 Thou that art waxen old in wicked days, now thy sins which thou hast committed

aforetime are come to light; for thou hast pronounced false judgments, and hast been accustomed
to condemn the innocent, and to let the guilty go free, albeit the Lord saith, The innocent
and the righteous shalt thou not slay.”1515 Of whom also did the Lord say: “But if
the evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite
the man-servants and maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken; the lord of that servant
shall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and
shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.”1516</p>
<p>4. From all such persons, therefore, it behoves us to keep aloof, but to adhere to those
who, as I have already observed, do hold the doctrine of the apostles, and who, together
with the order of priesthood (presbyterii ordine), display sound speech and blameless conduct
for the confirmation and correction of others.1517 In this way, Moses, to whom such a
leadership was entrusted, relying on a good conscience, cleared himself before God, saying,
“I have not in covetousness taken anything belonging to one of these men, nor have I done
evil to one of them.”1518 In this way, too, Samuel, who judged the people so many years,
and bore rule over Israel without any pride, in the end cleared himself, saying, “I have walked
before you from my childhood even unto this day: answer me in the sight of God, and before
His anointed (Christi ejus); whose ox or whose ass of yours have I taken, or over whom have
I tyrannized, or whom have I oppressed? or if I have received from the hand of any a bribe
or [so much as] a shoe, speak out against me, and I will restore it to you.”1519 And when
the people had said to him, “Thou hast not tyrannized, neither hast thou oppressed us
neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s hand,” he called the Lord to witness, saying,
“The Lord is witness, and His Anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in
my hand. And they said to him, He is witness.” In this strain also the Apostle Paul, inasmuch
as he had a good conscience, said to the Corinthians: “For we are not as many, who corrupt
the Word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
Christ;”1520 “We have injured no man, corrupted no man, circumvented no man.”1521</p>
<p>5. Such presbyters does the Church nourish, of whom also the prophet says: “I will give
thy rulers in peace, and thy bishops in righteousness.”1522 Of whom also did the Lord declare,

“Who then shall be a faithful steward (actor), good and wise, whom the Lord sets over His
household, to give them their meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his Lord,
when He cometh, shall find so doing.”1523 Paul then, teaching us where one may find such,
says, “God hath placed in the Church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers.”1524
Where, therefore, the gifts of the Lord have been placed, there it behoves us to learn the
truth, [namely,] from those who possess that succession of the Church which is from the
apostles,1525 and among whom exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as well
as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech. For these also preserve this faith of
ours in one God who created all things; and they increase that love [which we have] for the
Son of God, who accomplished such marvellous dispensations for our sake: and they expound
the Scriptures to us without danger, neither blaspheming God, nor dishonouring the patriarchs,
nor despising the prophets.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII—The sins of the men of old time, which incurred the displeasure
of God, were, by His providence, committed to writing, that we might derive
instruction thereby, and not be filled with pride. We must not, therefore, infer
that there was another God than He whom Christ preached; we should rather
fear, lest the one and the same God who inflicted punishment on the ancients,
should bring down heavier upon us.</head>
<p>1. As I have heard from a certain presbyter,1526 who had heard it from those who had
seen the apostles, and from those who had been their disciples, the punishment [declared]
in Scripture was sufficient for the ancients in regard to what they did without the Spirit’s
guidance. For as God is no respecter of persons, He inflicted a proper punishment on deeds
displeasing to Him. As in the case of David,1527 when he suffered persecution from Saul for
righteousness’ sake, and fled from King Saul, and would not avenge himself of his enemy,
he both sung the advent of Christ, and instructed the nations in wisdom, and did everything
after the Spirit’s guidance, and pleased God. But when his lust prompted him to take
Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, the Scripture said concerning him, “Now, the thing (sermo)
which David had done appeared wicked in the eyes of the Lord;”1528 and Nathan the
prophet is sent to him, pointing out to him his crime, in order that he, passing sentence
upon and condemning himself, might obtain mercy and forgiveness from Christ: “And
[Nathan] said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; but the poor man had nothing, save
one little ewe-lamb, which he possessed, and nourished up; and it had been with him and
with his children together: it did eat of his own bread, and drank of his cup, and was to him
as a daughter. And there came a guest unto the rich man; and he spared to take of the flock
of his own ewe-lambs, and from the herds of his own oxen, to entertain the guest; but he
took the ewe-lamb of the poor man, and set it before the man that had come unto him. And
David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth,
the man that hath done this thing shall surely die (filius mortis est): and he shall restore the
lamb fourfold, because he hath done this thing, and because he had no pity for the poor
man. And Nathan said unto him, Thou art the man who hast done this.”1529 And then he
proceeds with the rest [of the narrative], upbraiding him, and recounting God’s benefits
towards him, and [showing him] how much his conduct had displeased the Lord. For [he
<note type="footnote">1526 Polycarp, Papias, Pothinus, and others, have been suggested as probably here referred to, but the point
is involved in utter uncertainty. [Surely this testimony is a precious intimation of the apostle’s meaning (Rom.
ii. 12–16), and the whole chapter is radiant with the purity of the Gospel.]</note>

declared] that works of this nature were not pleasing to God, but that great wrath was suspended
over his house. David, however, was struck with remorse on hearing this, and exclaimed,
“I have sinned against the Lord;” and he sung a penitential psalm, waiting for the
coming of the Lord, who washes and makes clean the man who had been fast bound with
[the chain of] sin. In like manner it was with regard to Solomon, while he continued to judge
uprightly, and to declare the wisdom of God, and built the temple as the type of truth, and
set forth the glories of God, and announced the peace about to come upon the nations, and
prefigured the kingdom of Christ, and spake three thousand parables about the Lord’s advent,
and five thousand songs, singing praise to God, and expounded the wisdom of God in creation,
[discoursing] as to the nature of every tree, every herb, and of all fowls, quadrupeds,
and fishes; and he said, “Will God whom the heavens cannot contain, really dwell with men
upon the earth?”1530 And he pleased God, and was the admiration of all; and all kings of
the earth sought an interview with him (quærebant faciem ejus) that they might hear the
wisdom which God had conferred upon him.1531 The queen of the south, too, came to him
from the ends of the earth, to ascertain the wisdom that was in him:1532 she whom the Lord
also referred to as one who should rise up in the judgment with the nations of those men
who do hear His words, and do not believe in Him, and should condemn them, inasmuch
as she submitted herself to the wisdom announced by the servant of God, while these men
despised that wisdom which proceeded directly from the Son of God. For Solomon was a
servant, but Christ is indeed the Son of God, and the Lord of Solomon. While, therefore, he
served God without blame, and ministered to His dispensations, then was he glorified: but
when he took wives from all nations, and permitted them to set up idols in Israel, the
Scripture spake thus concerning him: “And King Solomon was a lover of women, and he
took to himself foreign women; and it came to pass, when Solomon was old, his heart was
not perfect with the Lord his God. And the foreign women turned away his heart after
strange gods. And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord: he did not walk after the Lord,
as did David his father. And the Lord was angry with Solomon; for his heart was not perfect
with the Lord, as was the heart of David his father.”1533 The Scripture has thus sufficiently
reproved him, as the presbyter remarked, in order that no flesh may glory in the sight of
the Lord.</p>
<p>2. It was for this reason, too, that the Lord descended into the regions beneath the earth,
preaching His advent there also, and [declaring] the remission of sins received by those who
believe in Him.1534 Now all those believed in Him who had hope towards Him, that is, those

who proclaimed His advent, and submitted to His dispensations, the righteous men, the
prophets, and the patriarchs, to whom He remitted sins in the same way as He did to us,
which sins we should not lay to their charge, if we would not despise the grace of God. For
as these men did not impute unto us (the Gentiles) our transgressions, which we wrought
before Christ was manifested among us, so also it is not right that we should lay blame upon
those who sinned before Christ’s coming. For “all men come short of the glory of God,”1535
and are not justified of themselves, but by the advent of the Lord,—they who earnestly direct
their eyes towards His light. And it is for our instruction that their actions have been committed
to writing, that we might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and
that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and in the second place,
that we should keep from wickedness. For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the
gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they
committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what
shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord’s coming, and become
the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing
and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who
now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him; but the Son shall come
in the glory of the Father, requiring from His stewards and dispensers the money which He
had entrusted to them, with usury; and from those to whom He had given most shall He
demand most. We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be
severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have
come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further
forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom.1536 And therefore it was that Paul
said, “For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee,
who, when thou wert a wild olive tree, wert grafted into the fatness of the olive tree, and
wert made a partaker of its fatness.”1537</p>
<p>3. Thou wilt notice, too, that the transgressions of the common people have been described
in like manner, not for the sake of those who did then transgress, but as a means of
instruction unto us, and that we should understand that it is one and the same God against

whom these men sinned, and against whom certain persons do now transgress from among
those who profess to have believed in Him. But this also, [as the presbyter states,] has Paul
declared most plainly in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he says, “Brethren, I would
not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and were all
baptized unto Moses in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the
same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock
was Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in
the wilderness. These things were for our example (in figuram nostri), to the intent that we
should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted; neither be ye idolaters, as were some of
them, as it is written:1538 The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither
let us commit fornication, as some of them also did, and fell in one day three and twenty
thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed
of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the
destroyer. But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written for our admonition,
upon whom the end of the world (sæculorum) is come. Wherefore let him that
thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.”1539</p>
<p>4. Since therefore, beyond all doubt and contradiction, the apostle shows that there is
one and the same God, who did both enter into judgment with these former things, and
who does inquire into those of the present time, and points out why these things have been
committed to writing; all these men are found to be unlearned and presumptuous, nay, even
destitute of common sense, who, because of the transgressions of them of old time, and because
of the disobedience of a vast number of them, do allege that there was indeed one God
of these men, and that He was the maker of the world, and existed in a state of degeneracy;
but that there was another Father declared by Christ, and that this Being is He who has been
conceived by the mind of each of them; not understanding that as, in the former case, God
showed Himself not well pleased in many instances towards those who sinned, so also in
the latter, “many are called, but few are chosen.”1540 As then the unrighteous, the idolaters,
and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are
sent into eternal fire;1541 and the apostle says, “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”1542 And

as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us, lest we should be
cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing, he proceeds to say, “And such
indeed were ye; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and by the Spirit of our God.” And just as then, those who led vicious lives, and put other
people astray, were condemned and cast out, so also even now the offending eye is plucked
out, and the foot and the hand, lest the rest of the body perish in like manner.1543 And we
have the precept: “If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater,
or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one go not to eat.”1544 And
again does the apostle say, “Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these
things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers
with them.”1545 And as then the condemnation of sinners extended to others who approved
of them, and joined in their society; so also is it the case at present, that “a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump.”1546 And as the wrath of God did then descend upon the unrighteous,
here also does the apostle likewise say: “For the wrath of God shall be revealed from
heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of those men who hold back the truth
in unrighteousness.”1547 And as, in those times, vengeance came from God upon the
Egyptians who were subjecting Israel to unjust punishment, so is it now, the Lord truly declaring,
“And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him? I tell
you, that He will avenge them speedily.”1548 So says the apostle, in like manner, in the Epistle
to the Thessalonians: “Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, at the revealing of our Lord
Jesus Christ from heaven with His mighty angels, and in a flame of fire, to take vengeance
upon those who know not God, and upon those that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ: who shall also be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints,
and to be admired in all them who have believed in Him.”1549</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Those persons prove themselves senseless who exaggerate
the mercy of Christ, but are silent as to the judgment, and look only at the more
abundant grace of the New Testament; but, forgetful of the greater degree of
perfection which it demands from us, they endeavour to show that there is
another God beyond Him who created the world.</head>
<p>1. Inasmuch, then, as in both Testaments there is the same righteousness of God [displayed]
when God takes vengeance, in the one case indeed typically, temporarily, and more
moderately; but in the other, really, enduringly, and more rigidly: for the fire is eternal, and
the wrath of God which shall be revealed from heaven from the face of our Lord (as David
also says, “But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance
of them from the earth”1550), entails a heavier punishment on those who incur it,—the
elders pointed out that those men are devoid of sense, who, [arguing] from what happened
to those who formerly did not obey God, do endeavour to bring in another Father, setting
over against [these punishments] what great things the Lord had done at His coming to
save those who received Him, taking compassion upon them; while they keep silence with
regard to His judgment; and all those things which shall come upon such as have heard His
words, but done them not, and that it were better for them if they had not been born,1551
and that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment than for that
city which did not receive the word of His disciples.1552</p>
<p>2. For as, in the New Testament, that faith of men [to be placed] in God has been increased,
receiving in addition [to what was already revealed] the Son of God, that man too
might be a partaker of God; so is also our walk in life required to be more circumspect, when
we are directed not merely to abstain from evil actions, but even from evil thoughts, and
from idle words, and empty talk, and scurrilous language:1553 thus also the punishment of
those who do not believe the Word of God, and despise His advent, and are turned away
backwards, is increased; being not merely temporal, but rendered also eternal. For to
whomsoever the Lord shall say, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,”1554 these
shall be damned for ever; and to whomsoever He shall say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you for eternity,”1555 these do receive the kingdom for
ever, and make constant advance in it; since there is one and the same God the Father, and

His Word, who has been always present with the human race, by means indeed of various
dispensations, and has wrought out many things, and saved from the beginning those who
are saved, (for these are they who love God, and follow the Word of God according to the
class to which they belong,) and has judged those who are judged, that is, those who forget
God, and are blasphemous, and transgressors of His word.</p>
<p>3. For the self-same heretics already mentioned by us have fallen away from themselves,
by accusing the Lord, in whom they say that they believe. For those points to which they
call attention with regard to the God who then awarded temporal punishments to the unbelieving,
and smote the Egyptians, while He saved those that were obedient; these same [facts,
I say,] shall nevertheless repeat themselves in the Lord, who judges for eternity those whom
He doth judge, and lets go free for eternity those whom He does let go free: and He shall
[thus] be discovered, according to the language used by these men, as having been the cause
of their most heinous sin to those who laid hands upon Him, and pierced Him. For if He
had not so come, it follows that these men could not have become the slayers of their Lord;
and if He had not sent prophets to them, they certainly could not have killed them, nor the
apostles either. To those, therefore, who assail us, and say, If the Egyptians had not been
afflicted with plagues, and, when pursuing after Israel, been choked in the sea, God could
not have saved His people, this answer may be given;—Unless, then, the Jews had become
the slayers of the Lord (which did, indeed, take eternal life away from them), and, by killing
the apostles and persecuting the Church, had fallen into an abyss of wrath, we could not
have been saved. For as they were saved by means of the blindness of the Egyptians, so are
we, too, by that of the Jews; if, indeed, the death of the Lord is the condemnation of those
who fastened Him to the cross, and who did not believe His advent, but the salvation of
those who believe in Him. For the apostle does also say in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians:
“For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them which are saved, and in
them which perish: to the one indeed the savour of death unto death, but to the other the
savour of life unto life.”1556 To whom, then, is there the savour of death unto death, unless
to those who believe not neither are subject to the Word of God? And who are they that did
even then give themselves over to death? Those men, doubtless, who do not believe, nor

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Refutation of the arguments of the Marcionites, who attempted
to show that God was the author of sin, because He blinded Pharaoh and his
servants.</head>
<p>1. “But,” say they, “God hardened the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants.”1560 Those,
then, who allege such difficulties, do not read in the Gospel that passage where the Lord
replied to the disciples, when they asked Him, “Why speakest Thou unto them in parables?”—“
Because it is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven; but
to them I speak in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not hear,
understanding they may not understand; in order that the prophecy of Isaiah regarding
them may be fulfilled, saying, Make the heart of this people gross and make their ears dull,
and blind their eyes. But blessed are your eyes, which see the things that ye see; and your
ears, which hear what ye do hear.”1561 For one and the same God [that blesses others] inflicts
blindness upon those who do not believe, but who set Him at naught; just as the sun, which
is a creature of His, [acts with regard] to those who, by reason of any weakness of the eyes
cannot behold his light; but to those who believe in Him and follow Him, He grants a fuller
and greater illumination of mind. In accordance with this word, therefore, does the apostle
say, in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: “In whom the God of this world hath blinded
the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should
shine [unto them].”1562 And again, in that to the Romans: “And as they did not think fit to
have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things
that are not convenient.”1563 Speaking of antichrist, too, he says clearly in the Second to the
Thessalonians: “And for this cause God shall send them the working of error, that they
should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but consented
to iniquity.”1564</p>
<p>2. If, therefore, in the present time also, God, knowing the number of those who will
not believe, since He foreknows all things, has given them over to unbelief, and turned away
His face from men of this stamp, leaving them in the darkness which they have themselves
chosen for themselves, what is there wonderful if He did also at that time give over to their
unbelief, Pharaoh, who never would have believed, along with those who were with him?
As the Word spake to Moses from the bush: “And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not
let you go, unless by a mighty hand.”1565 And for the reason that the Lord spake in parables,

and brought blindness upon Israel, that seeing they might not see, since He knew the
[spirit of] unbelief in them, for the same reason did He harden Pharaoh’s heart; in order
that, while seeing that it was the finger of God which led forth the people, he might not believe,
but be precipitated into a sea of unbelief, resting in the notion that the exit of these
[Israelites] was accomplished by magical power, and that it was not by the operation of God
that the Red Sea afforded a passage to the people, but that this occurred by merely natural
causes (sed naturaliter sic se habere).</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Refutation of another argument adduced by the Marcionites,
that God directed the Hebrews to spoil the Egyptians.</head>
<p>1. Those, again, who cavil and find fault because the people did, by God’s command,
upon the eve of their departure, take vessels of all kinds and raiment from the Egyptians,1566
and so went away, from which [spoils], too, the tabernacle was constructed in the wilderness,
prove themselves ignorant of the righteous dealings of God, and of His dispensations; as
also the presbyter remarked: For if God had not accorded this in the typical exodus, no one
could now be saved in our true exodus; that is, in the faith in which we have been established,
and by which we have been brought forth from among the number of the Gentiles. For in
some cases there follows us a small, and in others a large amount of property, which we
have acquired from the mammon of unrighteousness. For from what source do we derive
the houses in which we dwell, the garments in which we are clothed, the vessels which we
use, and everything else ministering to our every-day life, unless it be from those things
which, when we were Gentiles, we acquired by avarice, or received them from our heathen
parents, relations, or friends who unrighteously obtained them?—not to mention that even
now we acquire such things when we are in the faith. For who is there that sells, and does
not wish to make a profit from him who buys? Or who purchases anything, and does not
wish to obtain good value from the seller? Or who is there that carries on a trade, and does
not do so that he may obtain a livelihood thereby? And as to those believing ones who are
in the royal palace, do they not derive the utensils they employ from the property which
belongs to Cæsar; and to those who have not, does not each one of these [Christians] give
according to his ability? The Egyptians were debtors to the [Jewish] people, not alone as to
property, but as their very lives, because of the kindness of the patriarch Joseph in former
times; but in what way are the heathen debtors to us, from whom we receive both gain and
profit? Whatsoever they amass with labour, these things do we make use of without labour,
although we are in the faith.</p>
<p>2. Up to that time the people served the Egyptians in the most abject slavery, as saith
the Scripture: “And the Egyptians exercised their power rigorously upon the children of Israel;
and they made life bitter to them by severe labours, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner
of service in the field which they did, by all the works in which they oppressed them with
rigour.”1567 And with immense labour they built for them fenced cities, increasing the
substance of these men throughout a long course of years, and by means of every species of
slavery; while these [masters] were not only ungrateful towards them, but had in contempla-

well.]</note>

<pb n="1251"/>
tion their utter annihilation. In what way, then, did [the Israelites] act unjustly, if out of
many things they took a few, they who might have possessed much property had they not
served them, and might have gone forth wealthy, while, in fact, by receiving only a very insignificant
recompense for their heavy servitude, they went away poor? It is just as if any
free man, being forcibly carried away by another, and serving him for many years, and increasing
his substance, should be thought, when he ultimately obtains some support, to
possess some small portion of his [master’s] property, but should in reality depart, having
obtained only a little as the result of his own great labours, and out of vast possessions which
have been acquired, and this should be made by any one a subject of accusation against him,
as if he had not acted properly.1568 He (the accuser) will rather appear as an unjust judge
against him who had been forcibly carried away into slavery. Of this kind, then, are these
men also, who charge the people with blame, because they appropriated a few things out of
many, but who bring no charge against those who did not render them the recompense due
to their fathers’ services; nay, but even reducing them to the most irksome slavery, obtained
the highest profit from them. And [these objectors] allege that [the Israelites] acted dishonestly,
because, forsooth, they took away for the recompense of their labours, as I have observed,
unstamped gold and silver in a few vessels; while they say that they themselves (for
let truth be spoken, although to some it may seem ridiculous) do act honestly, when they
carry away in their girdles from the labours of others, coined gold, and silver, and brass,
with Cæsar’s inscription and image upon it.</p>
<p>3. If, however, a comparison be instituted between us and them, [I would ask] which
party shall seem to have received [their worldly goods] in the fairer manner? Will it be the
[Jewish] people, [who took] from the Egyptians, who were at all points their debtors; or we,
[who receive property] from the Romans and other nations, who are under no similar obligation
to us? Yea, moreover, through their instrumentality the world is at peace, and we
walk on the highways without fear, and sail where we will.1569 Therefore, against men of
this kind (namely, the heretics) the word of the Lord applies, which says: “Thou hypocrite,
first cast the beam out of thine eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote out
of thy brother’s eye.”1570 For if he who lays these things to thy charge, and glories in his
own wisdom, has been separated from the company of the Gentiles, and possesses nothing
[derived from] other people’s goods, but is literally naked, and barefoot, and dwells homeless
among the mountains, as any of those animals do which feed on grass, he will stand excused
[in using such language], as being ignorant of the necessities of our mode of life. But if he

do partake of what, in the opinion of men, is the property of others, and if [at the same time]
he runs down their type,1571 he proves himself most unjust, turning this kind of accusation
against himself. For he will be found carrying about property not belonging to him, and
coveting goods which are not his. And therefore has the Lord said: “Judge not, that ye be
not judged: for with what judgment ye shall judge, ye shall be judged.”1572 [The meaning
is] not certainly that we should not find fault with sinners, nor that we should consent to
those who act wickedly; but that we should not pronounce an unfair judgment on the dispensations
of God, inasmuch as He has Himself made provision that all things shall turn
out for good, in a way consistent with justice. For, because He knew that we would make a
good use of our substance which we should possess by receiving it from another, He says,
“He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
him do likewise.”1573 And, “For I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and
ye gave Me drink; I was naked and ye clothed Me.”1574 And, “When thou doest thine alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.”1575 And we are proved to be righteous
by whatsoever else we do well, redeeming, as it were, our property from strange hands. But
thus do I say, “from strange hands,” not as if the world were not God’s possession, but that
we have gifts of this sort, and receive them from others, in the same way as these men had
them from the Egyptians who knew not God; and by means of these same do we erect in
ourselves the tabernacle of God: for God dwells in those who act uprightly, as the Lord says:
“Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that they, when ye shall
be put to flight,1576 may receive you into eternal tabernacles.”1577 For whatsoever we acquired
from unrighteousness when we were heathen, we are proved righteous, when we have become
believers, by applying it to the Lord’s advantage.</p>
<p>4. As a matter of course, therefore, these things were done beforehand in a type, and
from them was the tabernacle of God constructed; those persons justly receiving them, as
I have shown, while we were pointed out beforehand in them,—[we] who should afterwards
serve God by the things of others. For the whole exodus of the people out of Egypt, which
took place under divine guidance,1578 was a type and image of the exodus of the Church

<head>Chapter XXXI.—We should not hastily impute as crimes to the men of old time
those actions which the Scripture has not condemned, but should rather seek in
them types of things to come: an example of this in the incest committed by Lot.</head>
<p>1. When recounting certain matters of this kind respecting them of old time, the presbyter
[before mentioned] was in the habit of instructing us, and saying: “With respect to
those misdeeds for which the Scriptures themselves blame the patriarchs and prophets, we
ought not to inveigh against them, nor become like Ham, who ridiculed the shame of his
father, and so fell under a curse; but we should [rather] give thanks to God in their behalf,
inasmuch as their sins have been forgiven them through the advent of our Lord; for He said
that they gave thanks [for us], and gloried in our salvation.1581 With respect to those actions,
again, on which the Scriptures pass no censure, but which are simply set down [as having
occurred], we ought not to become the accusers [of those who committed them], for we are
not more exact than God, nor can we be superior to our Master; but we should search for
a type [in them]. For not one of those things which have been set down in Scripture without
being condemned is without significance.” An example is found in the case of Lot, who led
forth his daughters from Sodom, and these then conceived by their own father; and who
left behind him within the confines [of the land] his wife, [who remains] a pillar of salt unto
this day. For Lot, not acting under the impulse of his own will, nor at the prompting of
carnal concupiscence, nor having any knowledge or thought of anything of the kind, did
[in fact] work out a type [of future events]. As says the Scripture: “And that night the elder
went in and lay with her father; and Lot knew not when she lay down, nor when she
arose.”1582 And the same thing took place in the case of the younger: “And he knew not,”
it is said, “when she slept with him, nor when she arose.”1583 Since, therefore, Lot knew not
[what he did], nor was a slave to lust [in his actions], the arrangement [designed by God]
was carried out, by which the two daughters (that is, the two churches1584), who gave birth
to children begotten of one and the same father, were pointed out, apart from [the influence
of] the lust of the flesh. For there was no other person, [as they supposed], who could impart
to them quickening seed, and the means of their giving birth to children, as it is written:
“And the elder said unto the younger, And there is not a man on the earth to enter in unto
us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and let
us lie with him, and raise up seed from our father.”1585</p>
<note type="footnote">1581 [Thus far we have a most edifying instruction. The reader will be less edified with what follows, but it

<pb n="1255"/>
<p>2. Thus, after their simplicity and innocence, did these daughters [of Lot] so speak,
imagining that all mankind had perished, even as the Sodomites had done, and that the
anger of God had come down upon the whole earth. Wherefore also they are to be held excusable,
since they supposed that they only, along with their father, were left for the preservation
of the human race; and for this reason it was that they deceived their father. Moreover,
by the words they used this fact was pointed out—that there is no other one who can confer
upon the elder and younger church the [power of] giving birth to children, besides our
Father. Now the father of the human race is the Word of God, as Moses points out when
he says, “Is not He thy father who hath obtained thee [by generation], and formed thee, and
created thee?”1586 At what time, then, did He pour out upon the human race the life-giving
seed—that is, the Spirit of the remission of sins, through means of whom we are quickened?
Was it not then, when He was eating with men, and drinking wine upon the earth? For it
is said, “The Son of man came eating and drinking;”1587 and when He had lain down, He
fell asleep, and took repose. As He does Himself say in David, “I slept, and took repose.”1588
And because He used thus to act while He dwelt and lived among us, He says again, “And
my sleep became sweet unto me.”1589 Now this whole matter was indicated through Lot,
that the seed of the Father of all—that is, of the Spirit of God, by whom all things were
made—was commingled and united with flesh— that is, with His own workmanship; by
which commixture and unity the two synagogues—that is, the two churches—produced
from their own father living sons to the living God.</p>
<p>3. And while these things were taking place, his wife remained in [the territory of]
Sodomm, no longer corruptible flesh, but a pillar of salt which endures for ever;1590 and by
those natural processes1591 which appertain to the human race, indicating that the Church
also, which is the salt of the earth,1592 has been left behind within the confines of the earth,
and subject to human sufferings; and while entire members are often taken away from it,

<head>Chapter XXXII.—That one God was the author of both Testaments, is confirmed
by the authority of a presbyter who had been taught by the apostles.</head>
<p>1. After this fashion also did a presbyter,1594 a disciple of the apostles, reason with respect
to the two testaments, proving that both were truly from one and the same God. For [he
maintained] that there was no other God besides Him who made and fashioned us, and that
the discourse of those men has no foundation who affirm that this world of ours was made
either by angels, or by any other power whatsoever, or by another God. For if a man be once
moved away from the Creator of all things, and if he grant that this creation to which we
belong was formed by any other or through any other [than the one God], he must of necessity
fall into much inconsistency, and many contradictions of this sort; to which he will [be
able to] furnish no explanations which can be regarded as either probable or true. And, for
this reason, those who introduce other doctrines conceal from us the opinion which they
themselves hold respecting God, because they are aware of the untenable1595 and absurd
nature of their doctrine, and are afraid lest, should they be vanquished, they should have
some difficulty in making good their escape. But if any one believes in [only] one God, who
also made all things by the Word, as Moses likewise says, “God said, Let there be light: and
there was light;”1596 and as we read in the Gospel, “All things were made by Him; and
without Him was nothing made;”1597 and the Apostle Paul [says] in like manner, “There is
one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father, who is above all, and through all,
and in us all”1598—this man will first of all “hold the head, from which the whole body is
compacted and bound together, and, through means of every joint according to the measure
of the ministration of each several part, maketh increase of the body to the edification of
itself in love.”1599 And then shall every word also seem consistent to him,1600 if he for his
part diligently read the Scriptures in company with those who are presbyters in the Church,
among whom is the apostolic doctrine, as I have pointed out.</p>
<p>2. For all the apostles taught that there were indeed two testaments among the two
peoples; but that it was one and the same God who appointed both for the advantage of

Testaments, and diligently reads the Scriptures in company with the presbyters
of the Church, is a true spiritual disciple; and he will rightly understand and
interpret all that the prophets have declared respecting Christ and the liberty of
the New Testament.</head>
<p>1. A spiritual disciple of this sort truly receiving the Spirit of God, who was from the
beginning, in all the dispensations of God, present with mankind, and announced things
future, revealed things present, and narrated things past—[such a man] does indeed “judge
all men, but is himself judged by no man.”1605 For he judges the Gentiles, “who serve the
creature more than the Creator,”1606 and with a reprobate mind spend all their labour on
vanity. And he also judges the Jews, who do not accept of the word of liberty, nor are willing
to go forth free, although they have a Deliverer present [with them]; but they pretend, at a
time unsuitable [for such conduct], to serve, [with observances] beyond [those required by]
the law, God who stands in need of nothing, and do not recognise the advent of Christ,
which He accomplished for the salvation of men, nor are willing to understand that all the
prophets announced His two advents: the one, indeed, in which He became a man subject
to stripes, and knowing what it is to bear infirmity,1607 and sat upon the foal of an ass,1608
and was a stone rejected by the builders,1609 and was led as a sheep to the slaughter,1610
and by the stretching forth of His hands destroyed Amalek;1611 while He gathered from the

<p>2. Moreover, he shall also examine the doctrine of Marcion, [inquiring] how he holds
that there are two gods, separated from each other by an infinite distance.1618 Or how can
he be good who draws away men that do not belong to him from him who made them, and
calls them into his own kingdom? And why is his goodness, which does not save all [thus],
defective? Also, why does he, indeed, seem to be good as respects men, but most unjust with
regard to him who made men, inasmuch as he deprives him of his possessions? Moreover,
how could the Lord, with any justice, if He belonged to another father, have acknowledged
the bread to be His body, while He took it from that creation to which we belong, and affirmed
the mixed cup to be His blood?1619 And why did He acknowledge Himself to be the
Son of man, if He had not gone through that birth which belongs to a human being? How,
too, could He forgive us those sins for which we are answerable to our Maker and God?
And how, again, supposing that He was not flesh, but was a man merely in appearance,
could He have been crucified, and could blood and water have issued from His pierced
side?1620 What body, moreover, was it that those who buried Him consigned to the tomb?
And what was that which rose again from the dead?</p>
<p>3. [This spiritual man] shall also judge all the followers of Valentinus, because they do
indeed confess with the tongue one God the Father, and that all things derive their existence
from Him, but do at the same time maintain that He who formed all things is the fruit of
an apostasy or defect. [He shall judge them, too, because] they do in like manner confess
with the tongue one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, but assign in their [system of] doctrine
a production of his own to the Only-begotten, one of his own also to the Word, another to
Christ, and yet another to the Saviour; so that, according to them, all these beings are indeed
said [in Scripture to be], as it were, one; [while they maintain], notwithstanding, that each
one of them should be understood [to exist] separately [from the rest], and to have [had]
his own special origin, according to his peculiar conjunction. [It appears], then1621 that
their tongues alone, forsooth, have conceded the unity [of God], while their [real] opinion

when they shall be examined by Christ as to the points [of doctrine] which they have
invented. Him, too, they affirm to have been born at a later period than the Pleroma of the
Æons, and that His production took place after [the occurrence of] a degeneracy or apostasy;
and they maintain that, on account of the passion which was experienced by Sophia, they
themselves were brought to the birth. But their own special prophet Homer, listening to
whom they have invented such doctrines, shall himself reprove them, when he expresses
himself as follows:—

<p>[This spiritual man] shall also judge the vain speeches of the perverse Gnostics, by
showing that they are the disciples of Simon Magus.</p>
<p>4. He will judge also the Ebionites; [for] how can they be saved unless it was God who
wrought out their salvation upon earth? Or how shall man pass into God, unless God has
[first] passed into man? And how shall he (man) escape from the generation subject to death,
if not by means1623 of a new generation, given in a wonderful and unexpected manner (but
as a sign of salvation) by God—[I mean] that regeneration which flows from the virgin
through faith?1624 Or how shall they receive adoption from God if they remain in this [kind
of] generation, which is naturally possessed by man in this world? And how could He (Christ)
have been greater than Solomon,1625 or greater than Jonah, or have been the Lord of David,
1626 who was of the same substance as they were? How, too, could He have subdued1627
him who was stronger than men,1628 who had not only overcome man, but also retained
him under his power, and conquered him who had conquered, while he set free mankind
who had been conquered, unless He had been greater than man who had thus been vanquished?
But who else is superior to, and more eminent than, that man who was formed
after the likeness of God, except the Son of God, after whose image man was created? And

have shown in the immediately preceding book.</p>
<p>5. He shall also judge those who describe Christ as [having become man] only in [human]
opinion. For how can they imagine that they do themselves carry on a real discussion, when
their Master was a mere imaginary being? Or how can they receive anything stedfast from
Him, if He was a merely imagined being, and not a verity? And how can these men really
be partaken of salvation, if He in whom they profess to believe, manifested Himself as a
merely imaginary being? Everything, therefore, connected with these men is unreal, and
nothing [possessed of the character of] truth; and, in these circumstances, it may be made
a question whether (since, perchance, they themselves in like manner are not men, but mere
dumb animals) they do not present,1631 in most cases, simply a shadow of humanity.</p>
<p>6. He shall also judge false prophets, who, without having received the gift of prophecy
from God, and not possessed of the fear of God, but either for the sake of vainglory, or with
a view to some personal advantage, or acting in some other way under the influence of a
wicked spirit, pretend to utter prophecies, while all the time they lie against God.</p>
<p>7. He shall also judge those who give rise to schisms, who are destitute of the love of
God, and who look to their own special advantage rather than to the unity of the Church;
and who for trifling reasons, or any kind of reason which occurs to them, cut in pieces and
divide the great and glorious body of Christ, and so far as in them lies, [positively] destroy
it,—men who prate of peace while they give rise to war, and do in truth strain out a gnat,
but swallow a camel.1632 For no reformation of so great importance can be effected by them,
as will compensate for the mischief arising from their schism. He shall also judge all those
who are beyond the pale of the truth, that is, who are outside the Church; but he himself
shall be judged by no one. For to him all things are consistent: he has a full faith in one God
Almighty, of whom are all things; and in the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom
are all things, and in the dispensations connected with Him, by means of which the Son of
God became man; and a firm belief in the Spirit of God, who furnishes us with a knowledge
of the truth, and has set forth the dispensations of the Father and the Son, in virtue of which
He dwells with every generation of men,1633 according to the will of the Father.</p>

<p>8. True knowledge1634 is [that which consists in] the doctrine of the apostles, and the
ancient constitution1635 of the Church throughout all the world, and the distinctive manifestation
of the body1636 of Christ according to the successions of the bishops, by which
they have handed down that Church which exists in every place, and has come even unto
us, being guarded and preserved1637 without any forging of Scriptures, by a very complete
system1638 of doctrine, and neither receiving addition nor [suffering] curtailment [in the
truths which she believes]; and [it consists in] reading [the word of God] without falsification,
and a lawful and diligent exposition in harmony with the Scriptures, both without danger
and without blasphemy; and [above all, it consists in] the pre-eminent gift of love,1639 which
is more precious than knowledge, more glorious than prophecy, and which excels all the
other gifts [of God].</p>
<p>9. Wherefore the Church does in every place, because of that love which she cherishes
towards God, send forward, throughout all time, a multitude of martyrs to the Father; while
all others1640 not only have nothing of this kind to point to among themselves, but even
maintain that such witness-bearing is not at all necessary, for that their system of doctrines
is the true witness [for Christ], with the exception, perhaps, that one or two among them,
during the whole time which has elapsed since the Lord appeared on earth, have occasionally,
along with our martyrs, borne the reproach of the name (as if he too [the heretic] had obtained
mercy), and have been led forth with them [to death], being, as it were, a sort of retinue
granted unto them. For the Church alone sustains with purity the reproach of those
who suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake, and endure all sorts of punishments, and
are put to death because of the love which they bear to God, and their confession of His
Son; often weakened indeed, yet immediately increasing her members, and becoming whole
again, after the same manner as her type,1641 Lot’s wife, who became a pillar of salt. Thus,

too, [she passes through an experience] similar to that of the ancient prophets, as the Lord
509
declares, “For so persecuted they the prophets who were before you;”1642 inasmuch as she
does indeed, in a new fashion, suffer persecution from those who do not receive the word
of God, while the self-same spirit rests upon her1643 [as upon these ancient prophets].</p>
<p>10. And indeed the prophets, along with other things which they predicted, also foretold
this, that all those on whom the Spirit of God should rest, and who would obey the word of
the Father, and serve Him according to their ability, should suffer persecution, and be stoned
and slain. For the prophets prefigured in themselves all these things, because of their love
to God, and on account of His word. For since they themselves were members of Christ,
each one of them in his place as a member did, in accordance with this, set forth the
prophecy [assigned him]; all of them, although many, prefiguring only one, and proclaiming
the things which pertain to one. For just as the working of the whole body is exhibited
through means of our members, while the figure of a complete man is not displayed by one
member, but through means of all taken together, so also did all the prophets prefigure the
one [Christ]; while every one of them, in his special place as a member, did, in accordance
with this, fill up the [established] dispensation, and shadowed forth beforehand that particular
working of Christ which was connected with that member.</p>
<p>11. For some of them, beholding Him in glory, saw His glorious life (conversationem)
at the Father’s right hand;1644 others beheld Him coming on the clouds as the Son of man;1645
and those who declared regarding Him, “They shall look on Him whom they have
pierced,”1646 indicated His [second] advent, concerning which He Himself says, “Thinkest
thou that when the Son of man cometh, He shall find faith on the earth?”1647 Paul also refers
to this event when he says, “If, however, it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled rest with us, at the revelation
of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels, and in a flame of fire.”1648 Others
again, speaking of Him as a judge, and [referring], as if it were a burning furnace, [to] the
day of the Lord, who “gathers the wheat into His barn, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire,”1649 were accustomed to threaten those who were unbelieving, concerning
whom also the Lord Himself declares, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,

which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels.”1650 And the apostle in like
manner says [of them], “Who shall be punished with everlasting death from the face of the
Lord, and from the glory of His power, when He shall come to be glorified in His saints,
and to be admired in those who believe in Him.”1651 There are also some [of them] who
declare, “Thou art fairer than the children of men;”1652 and, “God, Thy God, hath anointed
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows;”1653 and, “Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh,
O Most Mighty, with Thy beauty and Thy fairness, and go forward and proceed prosperously;
and rule Thou because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness.”1654 And whatever other
things of a like nature are spoken regarding Him, these indicated that beauty and splendour
which exist in His kingdom, along with the transcendent and pre-eminent exaltation [belonging]
to all who are under His sway, that those who hear might desire to be found there,
doing such things as are pleasing to God. Again, there are those who say, “He is a man, and
who shall know him?”1655 and, “I came unto the prophetess, and she bare a son, and His
name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God;”1656 and those [of them] who proclaimed
Him as Immanuel, [born] of the Virgin, exhibited the union of the Word of God
with His own workmanship, [declaring] that the Word should become flesh, and the Son
of God the Son of man (the pure One opening purely that pure womb which regenerates
men unto God, and which He Himself made pure); and having become this which we also
are, He [nevertheless] is the Mighty God, and possesses a generation which cannot be declared.
And there are also some of them who say, “The Lord hath spoken in Zion, and uttered
His voice from Jerusalem;”1657 and, “In Judah is God known;”1658— these indicated His
advent which took place in Judea. Those, again, who declare that “God comes from the
south, and from a mountain thick with foliage,”1659 announced His advent at Bethlehem,
as I have pointed out in the preceding book.1660 From that place, also, He who rules, and
who feeds the people of His Father, has come. Those, again, who declare that at His coming

which were accomplished by Him.</p>
<p>12. Some of them, moreover—[when they predicted that] as a weak and inglorious man,
and as one who knew what it was to bear infirmity,1665 and sitting upon the foal of an ass,1666
He should come to Jerusalem; and that He should give His back to stripes,1667 and His
cheeks to palms [which struck Him]; and that He should be led as a sheep to the slaughter;1668
and that He should have vinegar and gall given Him to drink;1669 and that He should be
forsaken by His friends and those nearest to Him;1670 and that He should stretch forth His
hands the whole day long;1671 and that He should be mocked and maligned by those who
looked upon Him;1672 and that His garments should be parted, and lots cast upon His
raiment;1673 and that He should be brought down to the dust of death1674 with all [the
other] things of a like nature—prophesied His coming in the character of a man as He
entered Jerusalem, in which by His passion and crucifixion He endured all the things which
have been mentioned. Others, again, when they said, “The holy Lord remembered His own

save them,”1675 furnished us with the reason on account of which He suffered all these
things. Those, moreover, who said, “In that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall go down at

of the sun which at the time of His crucifixion took place from the sixth hour
onwards, and that after this event, those days which were their festivals according to the
law, and their songs, should be changed into grief and lamentation when they were handed
over to the Gentiles. Jeremiah, too, makes this point still clearer, when he thus speaks concerning
Jerusalem: “She that hath born [seven] languisheth; her soul hath become weary;
her sun hath gone down while it was yet noon; she hath been confounded, and suffered reproach:
the remainder of them will I give to the sword in the sight of their enemies.”1677</p>
<p>13. Those of them, again, who spoke of His having slumbered and taken sleep, and of
His having risen again because the Lord sustained Him,1678 and who enjoined the principalities
of heaven to set open the everlasting doors, that the King of glory might go in,1679
proclaimed beforehand His resurrection from the dead through the Father’s power, and
His reception into heaven. And when they expressed themselves thus, “His going forth is
from the height of heaven, and His returning even to the highest heaven; and there is no
one who can hide himself from His heat,”1680 they announced that very truth of His being
taken up again to the place from which He came down, and that there is no one who can
escape His righteous judgment. And those who said, “The Lord hath reigned; let the people
be enraged: [even] He who sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved,”1681 were
thus predicting partly that wrath from all nations which after His ascension came upon
those who believed in Him, with the movement of the whole earth against the Church; and
partly the fact that, when He comes from heaven with His mighty angels, the whole earth
shall be shaken, as He Himself declares, “There shall be a great earthquake, such as has not
been from the beginning.”1682 And again, when one says, “Whosoever is judged, let him
stand opposite; and whosoever is justified, let him draw near to the servant1683 of God;”1684
and, “Woe unto you, for ye shall wax old as doth a garment, and the moth shall eat you up;”
and, “All flesh shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in the highest,”1685—it
is thus indicated that, after His passion and ascension, God shall cast down under His feet

not such as that which He made with the fathers at Mount Horeb, and would give to men
a new heart and a new spirit;1687 and again, “And remember ye not the things of old: behold,
I make new things which shall now arise, and ye shall know it; and I will make a way in the
desert, and rivers in a dry land, to give drink to my chosen people, my people whom I have
acquired, that they may show forth my praise,”1688—plainly announced that liberty which
distinguishes the new covenant, and the new wine which is put into new bottles,1689 [that
is], the faith which is in Christ, by which He has proclaimed the way of righteousness sprung
up in the desert, and the streams of the Holy Spirit in a dry land, to give water to the elect
people of God, whom He has acquired, that they might show forth His praise, but not that
they might blaspheme Him who made these things, that is, God.</p>
<p>15. And all those other points which I have shown the prophets to have uttered by means
of so long a series of Scriptures, he who is truly spiritual will interpret by pointing out, in
regard to every one of the things which have been spoken, to what special point in the dispensation
of the Lord is referred, and [by thus exhibiting] the entire system of the work of
the Son of God, knowing always the same God, and always acknowledging the same Word
of God, although He has [but] now been manifested to us; acknowledging also at all times
the same Spirit of God, although He has been poured out upon us after a new fashion in
these last times, [knowing that He descends] even from the creation of the world to its end
upon the human race simply as such, from whom those who believe God and follow His
word receive that salvation which flows from Him. Those, on the other hand, who depart
from Him, and despise His precepts, and by their deeds bring dishonour on Him who made

most righteous judgment.1690 He therefore (i.e., the spiritual man) sifts and tries them all,
but he himself is tried by no man:1691 he neither blasphemes his Father, nor sets aside His
dispensations, nor inveighs against the fathers, nor dishonours the prophets, by maintaining
that they were [sent] from another God [than he worships], or again, that their prophecies
were derived from different sources.1692</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Proof against the Marcionites, that the prophets referred in
all their predictions to our Christ.</head>
<p>1. Now I shall simply say, in opposition to all the heretics, and principally against the
followers of Marcion, and against those who are like to these, in maintaining that the
prophets were from another God [than He who is announced in the Gospel], read with
earnest care that Gospel which has been conveyed to us by the apostles, and read with
earnest care the prophets, and you will find that the whole conduct, and all the doctrine,
and all the sufferings of our Lord, were predicted through them. But if a thought of this kind
should then suggest itself to you, to say, What then did the Lord bring to us by His advent?—
know ye that He brought all [possible] novelty, by bringing Himself who had been
announced. For this very thing was proclaimed beforehand, that a novelty should come to
renew and quicken mankind. For the advent of the King is previously announced by those
servants who are sent [before Him], in order to the preparation and equipment of those
men who are to entertain their Lord. But when the King has actually come, and those who
are His subjects have been filled with that joy which was proclaimed beforehand, and have
attained to that liberty which He bestows, and share in the sight of Him, and have listened
to His words, and have enjoyed the gifts which He confers, the question will not then be
asked by any that are possessed of sense what new thing the King has brought beyond [that
proclaimed by] those who announced His coming. For He has brought Himself, and has
bestowed on men those good things which were announced beforehand, which things the
angels desired to look into.1693</p>
<p>2. But the servants would then have been proved false, and not sent by the Lord, if Christ
on His advent, by being found exactly such as He was previously announced, had not fulfilled
their words. Wherefore He said, “Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the
prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Until heaven and
earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law and the prophets till all
come to pass.”1694 For by His advent He Himself fulfilled all things, and does still fulfil in
the Church the new covenant foretold by the law, onwards to the consummation [of all
things]. To this effect also Paul, His apostle, says in the Epistle to the Romans, “But now,1695
without the law, has the righteousness of God been manifested, being witnessed by the law
and the prophets; for the just shall live by faith.”1696 But this fact, that the just shall live by
faith, had been previously announced1697 by the prophets.</p>

<p>3. But whence could the prophets have had power to predict the advent of the King,
and to preach beforehand that liberty which was bestowed by Him, and previously to announce
all things which were done by Christ, His words, His works, and His sufferings, and
to predict the new covenant, if they had received prophetical inspiration from another God
[than He who is revealed in the Gospel], they being ignorant, as ye allege, of the ineffable
Father, of His kingdom, and His dispensations, which the Son of God fulfilled when He
came upon earth in these last times? Neither are ye in a position to say that these things
came to pass by a certain kind of chance, as if they were spoken by the prophets in regard
to some other person, while like events happened to the Lord. For all the prophets prophesied
these same things, but they never came to pass in the case of any one of the ancients. For if
these things had happened to any man among them of old time, those [prophets] who lived
subsequently would certainly not have prophesied that these events should come to pass in
the last times. Moreover, there is in fact none among the fathers, nor the prophets, nor the
ancient kings, in whose case any one of these things properly and specifically took place.
For all indeed prophesied as to the sufferings of Christ, but they themselves were far from
enduring sufferings similar to what was predicted. And the points connected with the passion
of the Lord, which were foretold, were realized in no other case. For neither did it happen
at the death of any man among the ancients that the sun set at mid-day, nor was the veil of
the temple rent, nor did the earth quake, nor were the rocks rent, nor did the dead rise up,
nor was any one of these men [of old] raised up on the third day, nor received into heaven,
nor at his assumption were the heavens opened, nor did the nations believe in the name of
any other; nor did any from among them, having been dead and rising again, lay open the
new covenant of liberty. Therefore the prophets spake not of any one else but of the Lord,
in whom all these aforesaid tokens concurred.</p>
<p>4. If any one, however, advocating the cause of the Jews, do maintain that this new
covenant consisted in the rearing of that temple which was built under Zerubbabel after the
emigration to Babylon, and in the departure of the people from thence after the lapse of
seventy years, let him know that the temple constructed of stones was indeed then rebuilt
(for as yet that law was observed which had been made upon tables of stone), yet no new
covenant was given, but they used the Mosaic law until the coming of the Lord; but from
the Lord’s advent, the new covenant which brings back peace, and the law which gives life,
has gone forth over the whole earth, as the prophets said: “For out of Zion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; and He shall rebuke many people; and they
shall break down their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks, and
they shall no longer learn to fight.”1698 If therefore another law and word, going forth from
Jerusalem, brought in such a [reign of] peace among the Gentiles which received it (the
<note type="footnote">1698 Isa. ii. 3, 4; Mic. iv. 2, 3.</note>

<pb n="1271"/>
word), and convinced, through them, many a nation of its folly, then [only] it appears that
the prophets spake of some other person. But if the law of liberty, that is, the word of God,
preached by the apostles (who went forth from Jerusalem) throughout all the earth, caused
such a change in the state of things, that these [nations] did form the swords and war-lances
into ploughshares, and changed them into pruning-hooks for reaping the corn, [that is],
into instruments used for peaceful purposes, and that they are now unaccustomed to fighting,
but when smitten, offer also the other cheek,1699 then the prophets have not spoken these
things of any other person, but of Him who effected them. This person is our Lord, and in
Him is that declaration borne out; since it is He Himself who has made the plough, and introduced
the pruning-hook, that is, the first semination of man, which was the creation exhibited
in Adam,1700 and the gathering in of the produce in the last times by the Word; and,
for this reason, since He joined the beginning to the end, and is the Lord of both, He has
finally displayed the plough, in that the wood has been joined on to the iron, and has thus
cleansed His land; because the Word, having been firmly united to flesh, and in its mechanism
fixed with pins,1701 has reclaimed the savage earth. In the beginning, He figured forth the
pruning-hook by means of Abel, pointing out that there should be a gathering in of a
righteous race of men. He says, “For behold how the just man perishes, and no man considers
it; and righteous men are taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.”1702 These things were
acted beforehand in Abel, were also previously declared by the prophets, but were accomplished
in the Lord’s person; and the same [is still true] with regard to us, the body following
the example of the Head.</p>
<p>5. Such are the arguments proper1703 [to be used] in opposition to those who maintain
that the prophets [were inspired] by a different God, and that our Lord [came] from another
Father, if perchance [these heretics] may at length desist from such extreme folly. This is
my earnest object in adducing these Scriptural proofs, that confuting them, as far as in me
lies, by these very passages, I may restrain them from such great blasphemy, and from insanely
fabricating a multitude of gods.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—A refutation of those who allege that the prophets uttered
some predictions under the inspiration of the highest, others from the Demiurge.
Disagreements of the Valentinians among themselves with regard to these same
predictions.</head>
<p>1. Then again, in opposition to the Valentinians, and the other Gnostics, falsely so called,
who maintain that some parts of Scripture were spoken at one time from the Pleroma (a
summitate) through means of the seed [derived] from that place, but at another time from
the intermediate abode through means of the audacious mother Prunica, but that many are
due to the Creator of the world, from whom also the prophets had their mission, we say
that it is altogether irrational to bring down the Father of the universe to such straits, as that
He should not be possessed of His own proper instruments, by which the things in the
Pleroma might be perfectly proclaimed. For of whom was He afraid, so that He should not
reveal His will after His own way and independently, freely, and without being involved
with that spirit which came into being in a state of degeneracy and ignorance? Was it that
He feared that very many would be saved, when more should have listened to the unadulterated
truth? Or, on the other hand, was He incapable of preparing for Himself those who
should announce the Saviour’s advent?</p>
<p>2. But if, when the Saviour came to this earth, He sent His apostles into the world to
proclaim with accuracy His advent, and to teach the Father’s will, having nothing in common
with the doctrine of the Gentiles or of the Jews, much more, while yet existing in the Pleroma,
would He have appointed His own heralds to proclaim His future advent into this world,
and having nothing in common with those prophecies originating from the Demiurge. But
if, when within the Pleroma, He availed Himself of those prophets who were under the law,
and declared His own matters through their instrumentality; much more would He, upon
His arrival hither, have made use of these same teachers, and have preached the Gospel to
us by their means. Therefore let them not any longer assert that Peter and Paul and the
other apostles proclaimed the truth, but that it was the scribes and Pharisees, and the others,
through whom the law was propounded. But if, at His advent, He sent forth His own apostles
in the spirit of truth, and not in that of error, He did the very same also in the case of the
prophets; for the Word of God was always the self-same: and if the Spirit from the Pleroma
was, according to these men’s system, the Spirit of light, the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of
perfection, and the Spirit of knowledge, while that from the Demiurge was the spirit of ignorance,
degeneracy, and error, and the offspring of obscurity; how can it be, that in one
and the same being there exists perfection and defect, knowledge and ignorance, error and
truth, light and darkness? But if it was impossible that such should happen in the case of
the prophets, for they preached the word of the Lord from one God, and proclaimed the
advent of His Son, much more would the Lord Himself never have uttered words, on one
occasion from above, but on another from degeneracy below, thus becoming the teacher at

<pb n="1273"/>
once of knowledge and of ignorance; nor would He have ever glorified as Father at one time
the Founder of the world, and at another Him who is above this one, as He does Himself
declare: “No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old one, nor do they put new
wine into old bottles.”1704 Let these men, therefore, either have nothing whatever to do with
the prophets, as with those that are ancients, and allege no longer that these men, being sent
beforehand by the Demiurge, spake certain things under that new influence which pertains
to the Pleroma; or, on the other hand, let them be convinced by our Lord, when He declares
that new wine cannot be put into old bottles.</p>
<p>3. But from what source could the offspring of their mother derive his knowledge of
the mysteries within the Pleroma, and power to discourse regarding them? Suppose that
the mother, while beyond the Pleroma, did bring forth this very offspring; but what is beyond
the Pleroma they represent as being beyond the pale of knowledge, that is, ignorance. How,
then, could that seed, which was conceived in ignorance, possess the power of declaring
knowledge? Or how did the mother herself, a shapeless and undefined being, one cast out
of doors as an abortion, obtain knowledge of the mysteries within the Pleroma, she who
was organized outside it and given a form there, and prohibited by Horos from entering
within, and who remains outside the Pleroma till the consummation [of all things], that is,
beyond the pale of knowledge? Then, again, when they say that the Lord’s passion is a type
of the extension of the Christ above, which he effected through Horos, and so imparted a
form to their mother, they are refuted in the other particulars [of the Lord’s passion], for
they have no semblance of a type to show with regard to them. For when did the Christ
above have vinegar and gall given him to drink? Or when was his raiment parted? Or when
was he pierced, and blood and water came forth? Or when did he sweat great drops of blood?
And [the same may be demanded] as to the other particulars which happened to the Lord,
of which the prophets have spoken. From whence, then, did the mother or her offspring
divine the things which had not yet taken place, but which should occur afterwards?</p>
<p>4. They affirm that certain things still, besides these, were spoken from the Pleroma,
but are confuted by those which are referred to in the Scriptures as bearing on the advent
of Christ. But what these are [that are spoken from the Pleroma] they are not agreed, but
give different answers regarding them. For if any one, wishing to test them, do question one
by one with regard to any passage those who are their leading men, he shall find one of them
referring the passage in question to the Propator—that is, to Bythus; another attributing it
to Arche—that is, to the Only-begotten; another to the Father of all—that is, to the Word;
while another, again, will say that it was spoken of that one Æon who was [formed from the
joint contributions] of the Æons in the Pleroma;1705 others [will regard the passage] as re-

<note type="footnote">1705 Book i. p. 334, this volume.</note>

<pb n="1274"/>
ferring to Christ, while another [will refer it] to the Saviour. One, again, more skilled than
these,1706 after a long protracted silence, declares that it was spoken of Horos; another that
it signifies the Sophia which is within the Pleroma; another that it announces the mother
outside the Pleroma; while another will mention the God who made the world (the Demiurge).
Such are the variations existing among them with regard to one [passage], holding
discordant opinions as to the same Scriptures; and when the same identical passage is read
out, they all begin to purse up their eyebrows, and to shake their heads, and they say that
they might indeed utter a discourse transcendently lofty, but that all cannot comprehend
the greatness of that thought which is implied in it; and that, therefore, among the wise the
chief thing is silence. For that Sige (silence) which is above must be typified by that silence
which they preserve. Thus do they, as many as they are, all depart [from each other], holding
so many opinions as to one thing, and bearing about their clever notions in secret within
themselves. When, therefore, they shall have agreed among themselves as to the things
predicted in the Scriptures, then also shall they be confuted by us. For, though holding
wrong opinions, they do in the meanwhile, however, convict themselves, since they are not
of one mind with regard to the same words. But as we follow for our teacher the one and
only true God, and possess His words as the rule of truth, we do all speak alike with regard
to the same things, knowing but one God, the Creator of this universe, who sent the
prophets, who led forth the people from the land of Egypt, who in these last times manifested
His own Son, that He might put the unbelievers to confusion, and search out the fruit of
righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—The prophets were sent from one and the same Father from
whom the Son was sent.</head>
<p>1. Which [God] the Lord does not reject, nor does He say that the prophets [spake]
from another god than His Father; nor from any other essence, but from one and the same
Father; nor that any other being made the things in the world, except His own Father, when
He speaks as follows in His teaching: “There was a certain householder, and he planted a
vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged in it a winepress, and built a tower, and
let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: And when the time of the fruit drew
near, he sent his servants unto the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And
the husbandmen took his servants: they cut one to pieces, stoned another, and killed another.
Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last
of all he sent unto them his only son, saying, Perchance they will reverence my son. But
when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let
us kill him, and we shall possess his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of
the vineyard, and slew him. When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will
he do unto these husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy these wicked
men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in
their season.”1707 Again does the Lord say: “Have ye never read, The stone which the
builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it
is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore I say unto you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken
from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.”1708 By these words He
clearly points out to His disciples one and the same Householder—that is, one God the
Father, who made all things by Himself; while [He shows] that there are various husbandmen,
some obstinate, and proud, and worthless, and slayers of the Lord, but others who render
Him, with all obedience, the fruits in their seasons; and that it is the same Householder
who sends at one time His servants, at another His Son. From that Father, therefore, from
whom the Son was sent to those husbandmen who slew Him, from Him also were the servants
[sent]. But the Son, as coming from the Father with supreme authority (principali auctoritate),
used to express Himself thus: “But I say unto you.”1709 The servants, again, [who came] as
from their Lord, spake after the manner of servants, [delivering a message]; and they
therefore used to say, “Thus saith the Lord.”</p>
<p>2. Whom these men did therefore preach to the unbelievers as Lord, Him did Christ
teach to those who obey Him; and the God who had called those of the former dispensation,
is the same as He who has received those of the latter. In other words, He who at first used

<note type="footnote">1709 Matt. v. 22.</note>

<pb n="1276"/>
that law which entails bondage, is also He who did in after times [call His people] by means
of adoption. For God planted the vineyard of the human race when at the first He formed
Adam and chose the fathers; then He let it out to husbandmen when He established the
Mosaic dispensation: He hedged it round about, that is, He gave particular instructions with
regard to their worship: He built a tower, [that is], He chose Jerusalem: He digged a winepress,
that is, He prepared a receptacle of the prophetic Spirit. And thus did He send prophets
prior to the transmigration to Babylon, and after that event others again in greater number
than the former, to seek the fruits, saying thus to them (the Jews): “Thus saith the Lord,
Cleanse your ways and your doings, execute just judgment, and look each one with pity and
compassion on his brother: oppress not the widow nor the orphan, the proselyte nor the
poor, and let none of you treasure up evil against his brother in your hearts, and love not
false swearing. Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your hearts, learn to do well,
seek judgment, protect the oppressed, judge the fatherless (pupillo), plead for the widow;
and come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.”1710 And again: “Keep thy tongue from
evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile; depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and
pursue it.”1711 In preaching these things, the prophets sought the fruits of righteousness.
But last of all He sent to those unbelievers His own Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom the
wicked husbandmen cast out of the vineyard when they had slain Him. Wherefore the Lord
God did even give it up (no longer hedged around, but thrown open throughout all the
world) to other husbandmen, who render the fruits in their seasons,—the beautiful elect
tower being also raised everywhere. For the illustrious Church is [now] everywhere, and
everywhere is the winepress digged: because those who do receive the Spirit are everywhere.
For inasmuch as the former have rejected the Son of God, and cast Him out of the vineyard
when they slew Him, God has justly rejected them, and given to the Gentiles outside the
vineyard the fruits of its cultivation. This is in accordance with what Jeremiah says, “The
Lord hath rejected and cast off the nation which does these things; for the children of Judah
have done evil in my sight, saith the Lord.”1712 And again in like manner does Jeremiah
speak: “I set watchmen over you; hearken to the sound of the trumpet; and they said, We
will not hearken. Therefore have the Gentiles heard, and they who feed the flocks in
them.”1713 It is therefore one and the same Father who planted the vineyard, who led forth
the people, who sent the prophets, who sent His own Son, and who gave the vineyard to
those other husbandmen that render the fruits in their season.</p>

<p>3. And therefore did the Lord say to His disciples, to make us become good workmen:
“Take heed to yourselves, and watch continually upon every occasion, lest at any time your
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day
shall come upon you unawares; for as a snare shall it come upon all dwelling upon the face
of the earth.”1714 “Let your loins, therefore, be girded about, and your lights burning, and
ye like to men who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding.”1715 “For as
it was in the days of Noe, they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they married and
were given in marriage, and they knew not, until Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
came and destroyed them all; as also it was in the days of Lot, they did eat and drink, they
bought and sold, they planted and builded, until the time that Lot went out of Sodom; it
rained fire from heaven, and destroyed them all: so shall it also be at the coming of the Son
of man.”1716 “Watch ye therefore, for ye know not in what day your Lord shall come.”1717
[In these passages] He declares one and the same Lord, who in the times of Noah brought
the deluge because of man’s disobedience, and who also in the days of Lot rained fire from
heaven because of the multitude of sinners among the Sodomites, and who, on account of
this same disobedience and similar sins, will bring on the day of judgment at the end of
time (in novissimo); on which day He declares that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrah than for that city and house which shall not receive the word of His apostles.
“And thou, Capernaum,” He said, “is it that thou shalt be exalted to heaven?1718 Thou shalt
go down to hell. For if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in
Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. Verily I say unto you, that it shall be more
tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”1719</p>
<p>4. Since the Son of God is always one and the same, He gives to those who believe on
Him a well of water1720 [springing up] to eternal life, but He causes the unfruitful fig-tree
immediately to dry up; and in the days of Noah He justly brought on the deluge for the
purpose of extinguishing that most infamous race of men then existent, who could not bring
forth fruit to God, since the angels that sinned had commingled with them, and [acted as
He did] in order that He might put a check upon the sins of these men, but [that at the same

time] He might preserve the archetype,1721 the formation of Adam. And it was He who
rained fire and brimstone from heaven, in the days of Lot, upon Sodom and Gomorrah, “an
example of the righteous judgment of God,”1722 that all may know, “that every tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.”1723 And it is He who
uses [the words], that it will be more tolerable for Sodom in the general judgment than for
those who beheld His wonders, and did not believe on Him, nor receive His doctrine.1724
For as He gave by His advent a greater privilege to those who believed on Him, and who do
His will, so also did He point out that those who did not believe on Him should have a more
severe punishment in the judgment; thus extending equal justice to all, and being to exact
more from those to whom He gives the more; the more, however, not because He reveals
the knowledge of another Father, as I have shown so fully and so repeatedly, but because
He has, by means of His advent, poured upon the human race the greater gift of paternal
grace.</p>
<p>5. If, however, what I have stated be insufficient to convince any one that the prophets
were sent from one and the same Father, from whom also our Lord was sent, let such a one,
opening the mouth of his heart, and calling upon the Master, Christ Jesus the Lord, listen
to Him when He says, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a king who made a marriage
for his son, and he sent forth his servants to call them who were bidden to the marriage.”
And when they would not obey, He goes on to say, “Again he sent other servants, saying,
Tell them that are bidden, Come ye, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and all the fatlings
are killed, and everything is ready; come unto the wedding. But they made light of it, and
went their way, some to their farm, and others to their merchandize; but the remnant took
his servants, and some they treated despitefully, while others they slew. But when the king
heard this, he was wroth, and sent his armies and destroyed these murderers, and burned
up their city, and said to his servants, The wedding is indeed ready, but they which were
bidden were not worthy. Go out therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
gather in to the marriage. So the servants went out, and collected together as many as they
found, bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with guests. But when the king came
in to see the guests, he saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto
him, Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on a wedding garment? But he was

speechless. Then said the king to his servants, Take him away, hand and foot, and cast him
into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but
few are chosen.”1725 Now, by these words of His, does the Lord clearly show all [these points,
viz.,] that there is one King and Lord, the Father of all, of whom He had previously said,
“Neither shalt thou swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;”1726 and that He
had from the beginning prepared the marriage for His Son, and used, with the utmost
kindness, to call, by the instrumentality of His servants, the men of the former dispensation
to the wedding feast; and when they would not obey, He still invited them by sending out
other servants, yet that even then they did not obey Him, but even stoned and slew those
who brought them the message of invitation. He accordingly sent forth His armies and
destroyed them, and burned down their city; but He called together from all the highways,
that is, from all nations, [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son, as also He says by
Jeremiah: “I have sent also unto you my servants the prophets to say, Return ye now, every
517
man, from his very evil way, and amend your doings.”1727 And again He says by the same
prophet: “I have also sent unto you my servants the prophets throughout the day and before
the light; yet they did not obey me, nor incline their ears unto me. And thou shall speak this
word to them: This is a people that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord, nor receiveth correction;
faith has perished from their mouth.”1728 The Lord, therefore, who has called us everywhere
by the apostles, is He who called those of old by the prophets, as appears by the words of
the Lord; and although they preached to various nations, the prophets were not from one
God, and the apostles from another; but, [proceeding] from one and the same, some of them
announced the Lord, others preached the Father, and others again foretold the advent of
the Son of God, while yet others declared Him as already present to those who then were
afar off.</p>
<p>6. Still further did He also make it manifest, that we ought, after our calling, to be also
adorned with works of righteousness, so that the Spirit of God may rest upon us; for this is
the wedding garment, of which also the apostle speaks, “Not for that we would be unclothed,
but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up by immortality.”1729 But those who
have indeed been called to God’s supper, yet have not received the Holy Spirit, because of
their wicked conduct “shall be,” He declares, “cast into outer darkness.”1730 He thus clearly

shows that the very same King who gathered from all quarters the faithful to the marriage
of His Son, and who grants them the incorruptible banquet, [also] orders that man to be
cast into outer darkness who has not on a wedding garment, that is, one who despises it.
For as in the former covenant, “with many of them was He not well pleased;”1731 so also is
it the case here, that “many are called, but few chosen.”1732 It is not, then, one God who
judges, and another Father who calls us together to salvation; nor one, forsooth, who confers
eternal light, but another who orders those who have not on the wedding garment to be
sent into outer darkness. But it is one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, from whom
also the prophets had their mission, who does indeed, through His infinite kindness, call
the unworthy; but He examines those who are called, [to ascertain] if they have on the garment
fit and proper for the marriage of His Son, because nothing unbecoming or evil pleases
Him. This is in accordance with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: “Behold,
thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”1733 For he who is
good, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure nothing evil, nor unjust, nor detestable
in His wedding chamber. This is the Father of our Lord, by whose providence all things
consist, and all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts upon those
who should [receive them]; but the most righteous Retributor metes out [punishment] according
to their deserts, most deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible
of His kindness; and therefore does He say, “He sent His armies, and destroyed those murderers,
and burned up their city.”1734 He says here, “His armies,” because all men are the
property of God. For “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that
dwell therein.”1735 Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Romans, “For
there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth
the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves
condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to an evil. Wilt thou then
not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same;
for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for
he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath upon
him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for
conscience sake. For this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God’s ministers, attending
continually upon this very thing.”1736 Both the Lord, then, and the apostles announce as

the one only God the Father, Him who gave the law, who sent the prophets, who made all
things; and therefore does He say, “He sent His armies,” because every man, inasmuch as
he is a man, is His workmanship, although he may be ignorant of his God. For He gives
existence to all; He, “who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth
rain upon the just and unjust.”1737</p>
<p>7. And not alone by what has been stated, but also by the parable of the two sons, the
younger of whom consumed his substance by living luxuriously with harlots, did the Lord
teach one and the same Father, who did not even allow a kid to his elder son; but for him
who had been lost, [namely] his younger son, he ordered the fatted calf to be killed, and he
518
gave him the best robe.1738 Also by the parable of the workmen who were sent into the
vineyard at different periods of the day, one and the same God is declared1739 as having
called some in the beginning, when the world was first created; but others afterwards, and
others during the intermediate period, others after a long lapse of time, and others again in
the end of time; so that there are many workmen in their generations, but only one householder
who calls them together. For there is but one vineyard, since there is also but one
righteousness, and one dispensator, for there is one Spirit of God who arranges all things;
and in like manner is there one hire, for they all received a penny each man, having [stamped
upon it] the royal image and superscription, the knowledge of the Son of God, which is
immortality. And therefore He began by giving the hire to those [who were engaged] last,
because in the last times, when the Lord was revealed He presented Himself to all [as their
reward].</p>
<p>8. Then, in the case of the publican, who excelled the Pharisee in prayer, [we find] that
it was not because he worshipped another Father that he received testimony from the Lord
that he was justified rather [than the other]; but because with great humility, apart from all
boasting and pride, he made confession to the same God.1740 The parable of the two sons
also: those who are sent into the vineyard, of whom one indeed opposed his father, but afterwards
repented, when repentance profited him nothing; the other, however, promised
to go, at once assuring his father, but he did not go (for “every man is a liar;”1741 “to will is
present with him, but he finds not means to perform”1742),—[this parable, I say], points
out one and the same Father. Then, again, this truth was clearly shown forth by the parable
of the fig-tree, of which the Lord says, “Behold, now these three years I come seeking fruit
<note type="footnote">1737 Matt. v. 45.</note>

<pb n="1282"/>
on this fig-tree, but I find none”1743 (pointing onwards, by the prophets, to His advent, by
whom He came from time to time, seeking the fruit of righteousness from them, which he
did not find), and also by the circumstance that, for the reason already mentioned, the figtree
should be hewn down. And, without using a parable, the Lord said to Jerusalem, “O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest those that are sent unto
thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate.”1744
For that which had been said in the parable, “Behold, for three years I come seeking fruit,”
and in clear terms, again, [where He says], “How often would I have gathered thy children
together,” shall be [found] a falsehood, if we do not understand His advent, which is [announced]
by the prophets—if, in fact, He came to them but once, and then for the first time.
But since He who chose the patriarchs and those [who lived under the first covenant], is
the same Word of God who did both visit them through the prophetic Spirit, and us also
who have been called together from all quarters by His advent; in addition to what has been
already said, He truly declared, “Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall
recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of
the kingdom shall go into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”1745
If, then, those who do believe in Him through the preaching of His apostles throughout the
east and west shall recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven, partaking
with them of the [heavenly] banquet, one and the same God is set forth as He who
did indeed choose the patriarchs, visited also the people, and called the Gentiles.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—Men are possessed of free will, and endowed with the faculty
of making a choice. It is not true, therefore, that some are by nature good, and
others bad.</head>
<p>1. This expression [of our Lord], “How often would I have gathered thy children together,
and thou wouldest not,”1746 set forth the ancient law of human liberty, because God made
man a free [agent] from the beginning, possessing his own power, even as he does his own
soul, to obey the behests (ad utendum sententia) of God voluntarily, and not by compulsion
of God. For there is no coercion with God, but a good will [towards us] is present with Him
continually. And therefore does He give good counsel to all. And in man, as well as in angels,
He has placed the power of choice (for angels are rational beings), so that those who had
yielded obedience might justly possess what is good, given indeed by God, but preserved
by themselves. On the other hand, they who have not obeyed shall, with justice, be not found
in possession of the good, and shall receive condign punishment: for God did kindly bestow
on them what was good; but they themselves did not diligently keep it, nor deem it something
precious, but poured contempt upon His super-eminent goodness. Rejecting therefore the
good, and as it were spuing it out, they shall all deservedly incur the just judgment of God,
which also the Apostle Paul testifies in his Epistle to the Romans, where he says, “But dost
thou despise the riches of His goodness, and patience, and long-suffering, being ignorant
that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But according to thy hardness and
impenitent heart, thou treasurest to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation
of the righteous judgment of God.” “But glory and honour,” he says, “to every one that doeth
good.”1747 God therefore has given that which is good, as the apostle tells us in this Epistle,
and they who work it shall receive glory and honour, because they have done that which is
good when they had it in their power not to do it; but those who do it not shall receive the
just judgment of God, because they did not work good when they had it in their power so
to do.</p>
<p>2. But if some had been made by nature bad, and others good, these latter would not be
deserving of praise for being good, for such were they created; nor would the former be
reprehensible, for thus they were made [originally]. But since all men are of the same nature,
able both to hold fast and to do what is good; and, on the other hand, having also the power
to cast it from them and not to do it,—some do justly receive praise even among men who
are under the control of good laws (and much more from God), and obtain deserved testimony
of their choice of good in general, and of persevering therein; but the others are
blamed, and receive a just condemnation, because of their rejection of what is fair and good.
And therefore the prophets used to exhort men to what was good, to act justly and to work
<note type="footnote">1746 Matt. xxiii. 37.</note>
<note type="footnote">1747 Rom. ii. 4, 5, 7.</note>

<pb n="1284"/>
righteousness, as I have so largely demonstrated, because it is in our power so to do, and
because by excessive negligence we might become forgetful, and thus stand in need of that
good counsel which the good God has given us to know by means of the prophets.</p>
<p>3. For this reason the Lord also said, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may
see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”1748 And, “Take heed to
yourselves, lest perchance your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness,
and worldly cares.”1749 And, “Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, and
ye like unto men that wait for their Lord, when He returns from the wedding, that when
He cometh and knocketh, they may open to Him. Blessed is that servant whom his Lord,
when He cometh, shall find so doing.”1750 And again, “The servant who knows his Lord’s
will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.”1751 And, “Why call ye me, Lord,
Lord, and do not the things which I say?”1752 And again, “But if the servant say in his heart,
The Lord delayeth, and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and to eat, and drink, and to be
drunken, his Lord will come in a day on which he does not expect Him, and shall cut him
in sunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.”1753 All such passages demonstrate
the independent will1754 of man, and at the same time the counsel which God conveys to
him, by which He exhorts us to submit ourselves to Him, and seeks to turn us away from
[the sin of] unbelief against Him, without, however, in any way coercing us.</p>
<p>4. No doubt, if any one is unwilling to follow the Gospel itself, it is in his power [to reject
it], but it is not expedient. For it is in man’s power to disobey God, and to forfeit what is
good; but [such conduct] brings no small amount of injury and mischief. And on this account
Paul says, “All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient;”1755 referring both
to the liberty of man, in which respect “all things are lawful,” God exercising no compulsion
in regard to him; and [by the expression] “not expedient” pointing out that we “should not
use our liberty as a cloak of maliciousness,”1756 for this is not expedient. And again he says,
“Speak ye every man truth with his neighbour.”1757 And, “Let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your mouth, neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor scurrility, which are

not convenient, but rather giving of thanks.”1758 And, “For ye were sometimes darkness,
but now are ye light in the Lord; walk honestly as children of the light, not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in anger and jealousy. And such were
some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified in the name of our
Lord.”1759 If then it were not in our power to do or not to do these things, what reason had
the apostle, and much more the Lord Himself, to give us counsel to do some things, and to
abstain from others? But because man is possessed of free will from the beginning, and God
is possessed of free will, in whose likeness man was created, advice is always given to him
to keep fast the good, which thing is done by means of obedience to God.</p>
<p>5. And not merely in works, but also in faith, has God preserved the will of man free
and under his own control, saying, “According to thy faith be it unto thee;”1760 thus
showing that there is a faith specially belonging to man, since he has an opinion specially
his own. And again, “All things are possible to him that believeth;”1761 and, “Go thy way;
and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.”1762 Now all such expressions demonstrate
that man is in his own power with respect to faith. And for this reason, “he that believeth
in Him has eternal life while he who believeth not the Son hath not eternal life, but the wrath
of God shall remain upon him.”1763 In the same manner therefore the Lord, both showing
His own goodness, and indicating that man is in his own free will and his own power, said
to Jerusalem, “How often have I wished to gather thy children together, as a hen [gathereth]
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Wherefore your house shall be left unto
you desolate.”1764</p>
<p>6. Those, again, who maintain the opposite to these [conclusions], do themselves present
the Lord as destitute of power, as if, forsooth, He were unable to accomplish what He willed;
or, on the other hand, as being ignorant that they were by nature “material,” as these men
express it, and such as cannot receive His immortality. “But He should not,” say they, “have
created angels of such a nature that they were capable of transgression, nor men who immediately
proved ungrateful towards Him; for they were made rational beings, endowed with
the power of examining and judging, and were not [formed] as things irrational or of a
[merely] animal nature, which can do nothing of their own will, but are drawn by necessity
and compulsion to what is good, in which things there is one mind and one usage, working

mechanically in one groove (inflexibiles et sine judicio), who are incapable of being anything
else except just what they had been created.” But upon this supposition, neither would what
is good be grateful to them, nor communion with God be precious, nor would the good be
very much to be sought after, which would present itself without their own proper endeavour,
care, or study, but would be implanted of its own accord and without their concern. Thus
it would come to pass, that their being good would be of no consequence, because they were
so by nature rather than by will, and are possessors of good spontaneously, not by choice;
and for this reason they would not understand this fact, that good is a comely thing, nor
would they take pleasure in it. For how can those who are ignorant of good enjoy it? Or
what credit is it to those who have not aimed at it? And what crown is it to those who have
not followed in pursuit of it, like those victorious in the contest?</p>
<p>7. On this account, too, did the Lord assert that the kingdom of heaven was the portion
of “the violent;” and He says, “The violent take it by force;”1765 that is, those who by strength
and earnest striving are on the watch to snatch it away on the moment. On this account also
Paul the Apostle says to the Corinthians, “Know ye not, that they who run in a racecourse,
do all indeed run, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. Every one also
who engages in the contest is temperate in all things: now these men [do it] that they may
obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. But I so run, not as uncertainty; I fight,
not as one beating the air; but I make my body livid, and bring it into subjection, lest by any
means, when preaching to others, I may myself be rendered a castaway.”1766 This able
wrestler, therefore, exhorts us to the struggle for immortality, that we may be crowned, and
may deem the crown precious, namely, that which is acquired by our struggle, but which
does not encircle us of its own accord (sed non ultro coalitam). And the harder we strive,
so much is it the more valuable; while so much the more valuable it is, so much the more
should we esteem it. And indeed those things are not esteemed so highly which come
spontaneously, as those which are reached by much anxious care. Since, then, this power
has been conferred upon us, both the Lord has taught and the apostle has enjoined us the
more to love God, that we may reach this [prize] for ourselves by striving after it. For otherwise,
no doubt, this our good would be [virtually] irrational, because not the result of trial.
Moreover, the faculty of seeing would not appear to be so desirable, unless we had known
what a loss it were to be devoid of sight; and health, too, is rendered all the more estimable
by an acquaintance with disease; light, also, by contrasting it with darkness; and life with
death. Just in the same way is the heavenly kingdom honourable to those who have known
the earthly one. But in proportion as it is more honourable, so much the more do we prize
it; and if we have prized it more, we shall be the more glorious in the presence of God. The

Lord has therefore endured all these things on our behalf, in order that we, having been instructed
by means of them all, may be in all respects circumspect for the time to come, and
that, having been rationally taught to love God, we may continue in His perfect love: for
God has displayed long-suffering in the case of man’s apostasy; while man has been instructed
by means of it, as also the prophet says, “Thine own apostasy shall heal thee;”1767 God thusw
determining all things beforehand for the bringing of man to perfection, for his edification,
and for the revelation of His dispensations, that goodness may both be made apparent, and
righteousness perfected, and that the Church may be fashioned after the image of His Son,
and that man may finally be brought to maturity at some future time, becoming ripe through
such privileges to see and comprehend God.1768</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—Why man was not made perfect from the beginning.</head>
<p>1. If, however, any one say, “What then? Could not God have exhibited man as perfect
from beginning?” let him know that, inasmuch as God is indeed always the same and unbegotten
as respects Himself, all things are possible to Him. But created things must be inferior
to Him who created them, from the very fact of their later origin; for it was not possible for
things recently created to have been uncreated. But inasmuch as they are not uncreated, for
this very reason do they come short of the perfect. Because, as these things are of later date,
so are they infantile; so are they unaccustomed to, and unexercised in, perfect discipline.
For as it certainly is in the power of a mother to give strong food to her infant, [but she does
not do so], as the child is not yet able to receive more substantial nourishment; so also it
was possible for God Himself to have made man perfect from the first, but man could not
receive this [perfection], being as yet an infant. And for this cause our Lord in these last
times, when He had summed up all things into Himself, came to us, not as He might have
come, but as we were capable of beholding Him. He might easily have come to us in His
immortal glory, but in that case we could never have endured the greatness of the glory; and
therefore it was that He, who was the perfect bread of the Father, offered Himself to us as
milk, [because we were] as infants. He did this when He appeared as a man, that we, being
nourished, as it were, from the breast of His flesh, and having, by such a course of milk
nourishment, become accustomed to eat and drink the Word of God, may be able also to
contain in ourselves the Bread of immortality, which is the Spirit of the Father.</p>
<p>2. And on this account does Paul declare to the Corinthians, “I have fed you with milk,
not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it.”1769 That is, ye have indeed learned
the advent of our Lord as a man; nevertheless, because of your infirmity, the Spirit of the
Father has not as yet rested upon you. “For when envying and strife,” he says, “and dissensions
are among you, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?”1770 That is, that the Spirit of the
Father was not yet with them, on account of their imperfection and shortcomings of their
walk in life. As, therefore, the apostle had the power to give them strong meat—for those
upon whom the apostles laid hands received the Holy Spirit, who is the food of life [eternal]
—but they were not capable of receiving it, because they had the sentient faculties of the
soul still feeble and undisciplined in the practice of things pertaining to God; so, in like
manner, God had power at the beginning to grant perfection to man; but as the latter was
only recently created, he could not possibly have received it, or even if he had received it,
could he have contained it, or containing it, could he have retained it. It was for this reason
that the Son of God, although He was perfect, passed through the state of infancy in common
with the rest of mankind, partaking of it thus not for His own benefit, but for that of the
<note type="footnote">1769 1 Cor. iii. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1770 1 Cor. iii. 3.</note>

<pb n="1289"/>
infantile stage of man’s existence, in order that man might be able to receive Him. There
was nothing, therefore, impossible to and deficient in God, [implied in the fact] that man
was not an uncreated being; but this merely applied to him who was lately created, [namely]
man.</p>
<p>3. With God there are simultaneously exhibited power, wisdom, and goodness. His
power and goodness [appear] in this, that of His own will He called into being and fashioned
things having no previous existence; His wisdom [is shown] in His having made created
things parts of one harmonious and consistent whole; and those things which, through His
super-eminent kindness, receive growth and a long period of existence, do reflect the glory
of the uncreated One, of that God who bestows what is good ungrudgingly. For from the
very fact of these things having been created, [it follows] that they are not uncreated; but
by their continuing in being throughout a long course of ages, they shall receive a faculty
of the Uncreated, through the gratuitous bestowal of eternal existence upon them by God.
And thus in all things God has the pre-eminence, who alone is uncreated, the first of all
things, and the primary cause of the existence of all, while all other things remain under
God’s subjection. But being in subjection to God is continuance in immortality, and immortality
is the glory of the uncreated One. By this arrangement, therefore, and these harmonies,
and a sequence of this nature, man, a created and organized being, is rendered after the
image and likeness of the uncreated God,—the Father planning everything well and giving
His commands, the Son carrying these into execution and performing the work of creating,
and the Spirit nourishing and increasing [what is made], but man making progress day by
day, and ascending towards the perfect, that is, approximating to the uncreated One. For
the Uncreated is perfect, that is, God. Now it was necessary that man should in the first instance
be created; and having been created, should receive growth; and having received
growth, should be strengthened; and having been strengthened, should abound; and having
abounded, should recover [from the disease of sin]; and having recovered, should be glorified;
and being glorified, should see his Lord. For God is He who is yet to be seen, and the beholding
of God is productive of immortality, but immortality renders one nigh unto God.</p>
<p>4. Irrational, therefore, in every respect, are they who await not the time of increase, but
ascribe to God the infirmity of their nature. Such persons know neither God nor themselves,
being insatiable and ungrateful, unwilling to be at the outset what they have also been created—
men subject to passions; but go beyond the law of the human race, and before that
they become men, they wish to be even now like God their Creator, and they who are more
destitute of reason than dumb animals [insist] that there is no distinction between the uncreated
God and man, a creature of to-day. For these, [the dumb animals], bring no charge
against God for not having made them men; but each one, just as he has been created, gives
thanks that he has been created. For we cast blame upon Him, because we have not been
made gods from the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods; although God

<pb n="1290"/>
has adopted this course out of His pure benevolence, that no one may impute to Him invidiousness
or grudgingness. He declares, “I have said, Ye are gods; and ye are all sons of the
Highest.”1771 But since we could not sustain the power of divinity, He adds, “But ye shall
die like men,” setting forth both truths—the kindness of His free gift, and our weakness,
and also that we were possessed of power over ourselves. For after His great kindness He
graciously conferred good [upon us], and made men like to Himself, [that is] in their own
power; while at the same time by His prescience He knew the infirmity of human beings,
and the consequences which would flow from it; but through [His] love and [His] power,
He shall overcome the substance of created nature.1772 For it was necessary, at first, that
nature should be exhibited; then, after that, that what was mortal should be conquered and
swallowed up by immortality, and the corruptible by incorruptibility, and that man should
be made after the image and likeness of God, having received the knowledge of good and
evil.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—Man is endowed with the faculty of distinguishing good and
evil; so that, without compulsion, he has the power, by his own will and choice,
to perform God’s commandments, by doing which he avoids the evils prepared
for the rebellious.</head>
<p>1. Man has received the knowledge of good and evil. It is good to obey God, and to believe
in Him, and to keep His commandment, and this is the life of man; as not to obey God is
evil, and this is his death. Since God, therefore, gave [to man] such mental power (magnanimitatem)
man knew both the good of obedience and the evil of disobedience, that the eye
of the mind, receiving experience of both, may with judgment make choice of the better
things; and that he may never become indolent or neglectful of God’s command; and
learning by experience that it is an evil thing which deprives him of life, that is, disobedience
to God, may never attempt it at all, but that, knowing that what preserves his life, namely,
obedience to God, is good, he may diligently keep it with all earnestness. Wherefore he has
also had a twofold experience, possessing knowledge of both kinds, that with discipline he
may make choice of the better things. But how, if he had no knowledge of the contrary,
could he have had instruction in that which is good? For there is thus a surer and an undoubted
comprehension of matters submitted to us than the mere surmise arising from an
opinion regarding them. For just as the tongue receives experience of sweet and bitter by
means of tasting, and the eye discriminates between black and white by means of vision,
and the ear recognises the distinctions of sounds by hearing; so also does the mind, receiving
through the experience of both the knowledge of what is good, become more tenacious of
its preservation, by acting in obedience to God: in the first place, casting away, by means of
repentance, disobedience, as being something disagreeable and nauseous; and afterwards
coming to understand what it really is, that it is contrary to goodness and sweetness, so that
the mind may never even attempt to taste disobedience to God. But if any one do shun the
knowledge of both these kinds of things, and the twofold perception of knowledge, he unawares
divests himself of the character of a human being.</p>
<p>2. How, then, shall he be a God, who has not as yet been made a man? Or how can he
be perfect who was but lately created? How, again, can he be immortal, who in his mortal
nature did not obey his Maker? For it must be that thou, at the outset, shouldest hold the
rank of a man, and then afterwards partake of the glory of God. For thou dost not make
God, but God thee. If, then, thou art God’s workmanship, await the hand of thy Maker
which creates everything in due time; in due time as far as thou art concerned, whose creation
is being carried out.1773 Offer to Him thy heart in a soft and tractable state, and preserve
the form in which the Creator has fashioned thee, having moisture in thyself, lest, by becoming
hardened, thou lose the impressions of His fingers. But by preserving the framework
<note type="footnote">1773 Efficeris.</note>

<pb n="1292"/>
thou shalt ascend to that which is perfect, for the moist clay which is in thee is hidden [there]
by the workmanship of God. His hand fashioned thy substance; He will cover thee over
[too] within and without with pure gold and silver, and He will adorn thee to such a degree,
that even “the King Himself shall have pleasure in thy beauty.”1774 But if thou, being obstinately
hardened, dost reject the operation of His skill, and show thyself ungrateful towards
Him, because thou wert created a [mere] man, by becoming thus ungrateful to God, thou
hast at once lost both His workmanship and life. For creation is an attribute of the goodness
of God but to be created is that of human nature. If then, thou shalt deliver up to Him what
is thine, that is, faith towards Him and subjection, thou shalt receive His handiwork, and
shall be a perfect work of God.</p>
<p>3. If, however, thou wilt not believe in Him, and wilt flee from His hands, the cause of
imperfection shall be in thee who didst not obey, but not in Him who called [thee]. For He
commissioned [messengers] to call people to the marriage, but they who did not obey Him
deprived themselves of the royal supper.1775 The skill of God, therefore, is not defective,
for He has power of the stones to raise up children to Abraham;1776 but the man who does
not obtain it is the cause to himself of his own imperfection. Nor, [in like manner], does the
light fail because of those who have blinded themselves; but while it remains the same as
ever, those who are [thus] blinded are involved in darkness through their own fault. The
light does never enslave any one by necessity; nor, again, does God exercise compulsion
upon any one unwilling to accept the exercise of His skill. Those persons, therefore, who
have apostatized from the light given by the Father, and transgressed the law of liberty, have
done so through their own fault, since they have been created free agents, and possessed of
power over themselves.</p>
<p>4. But God, foreknowing all things, prepared fit habitations for both, kindly conferring
that light which they desire on those who seek after the light of incorruption, and resort to
it; but for the despisers and mockers who avoid and turn themselves away from this light,
and who do, as it were, blind themselves, He has prepared darkness suitable to persons who
oppose the light, and He has inflicted an appropriate punishment upon those who try to
avoid being subject to Him. Submission to God is eternal rest, so that they who shun the
light have a place worthy of their flight; and those who fly from eternal rest, have a habitation
in accordance with their fleeing. Now, since all good things are with God, they who by their
own determination fly from God, do defraud themselves of all good things; and having been
[thus] defrauded of all good things with respect to God, they shall consequently fall under
the just judgment of God. For those persons who shun rest shall justly incur punishment,
<note type="footnote">1774 Ps. xlv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1775 Matt. xxii. 3, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">1776 Matt. iii. 9.</note>

<pb n="1293"/>
and those who avoid the light shall justly dwell in darkness. For as in the case of this temporal
light, those who shun it do deliver themselves over to darkness, so that they do themselves
become the cause to themselves that they are destitute of light, and do inhabit darkness;
and, as I have already observed, the light is not the cause of such an [unhappy] condition
of existence to them; so those who fly from the eternal light of God, which contains in itself
all good things, are themselves the cause to themselves of their inhabiting eternal darkness,
destitute of all good things, having become to themselves the cause of [their consignment
to] an abode of that nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—One and the same God the Father inflicts punishment on the
reprobate, and bestows rewards on the elect.</head>
<p>1. It is therefore one and the same God the Father who has prepared good things with
Himself for those who desire His fellowship, and who remain in subjection to Him; and
who has the eternal fire for the ringleader of the apostasy, the devil, and those who revolted
with him, into which [fire] the Lord1777 has declared those men shall be sent who have been
set apart by themselves on His left hand. And this is what has been spoken by the prophet,
“I am a jealous God, making peace, and creating evil things;”1778 thus making peace and
friendship with those who repent and turn to Him, and bringing [them to] unity, but preparing
for the impenitent, those who shun the light, eternal fire and outer darkness, which
are evils indeed to those persons who fall into them.</p>
<p>2. If, however, it were truly one Father who confers rest, and another God who has
prepared the fire, their sons would have been equally different [one from the other]; one,
indeed, sending [men] into the Father’s kingdom, but the other into eternal fire. But inasmuch
as one and the same Lord has pointed out that the whole human race shall be divided at the
judgment, “as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats,”1779 and that to some He will
say, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which has been prepared for
you,”1780 but to others, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which My Father
has prepared for the devil and his angels,”1781 one and the same Father is manifestly declared
[in this passage], “making peace and creating evil things,” preparing fit things for both; as
also there is one Judge sending both into a fit place, as the Lord sets forth in the parable of
the tares and the wheat, where He says, “As therefore the tares are gathered together, and
burned in the fire, so shall it be at the end of the world. The Son of man shall send His angels,
and they shall gather from His kingdom everything that offendeth, and those who work
iniquity, and shall send them into a furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth. Then shall the just shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”1782 The
Father, therefore, who has prepared the kingdom for the righteous, into which the Son has
received those worthy of it, is He who has also prepared the furnace of fire, into which these
angels commissioned by the Son of man shall send those persons who deserve it, according
to God’s command.</p>

<p>3. The Lord, indeed, sowed good seed in His own field;1783 and He says, “The field is
the world.” But while men slept, the enemy came, and “sowed tares in the midst of the wheat,
and went his way.”1784 Hence we learn that this was the apostate angel and the enemy, because
he was envious of God’s workmanship, and took in hand to render this [workmanship]
an enmity with God. For this cause also God has banished from His presence him who did
of his own accord stealthily sow the tares, that is, him who brought about the transgression;
1785 but He took compassion upon man, who, through want of care no doubt, but still
wickedly [on the part of another], became involved in disobedience; and He turned the
enmity by which [the devil] had designed to make [man] the enemy of God, against the
author of it, by removing His own anger from man, turning it in another direction, and
sending it instead upon the serpent. As also the Scripture tells us that God said to the serpent,
“And I will place enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.
He1786 shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.”1787 And the Lord summed up
in Himself this enmity, when He was made man from a woman, and trod upon his [the
serpent’s] head, as I have pointed out in the preceding book.</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—Those persons who do not believe in God, but who are disobedient,
are angels and sons of the devil, not indeed by nature, but by imitation. Close
of this book, and scope of the succeeding one.</head>
<p>1. Inasmuch as the Lord has said that there are certain angels, [viz. those] of the devil,
for whom eternal fire is prepared; and as, again, He declares with regard to the tares, “The
tares are the children of the wicked one,”1788 it must be affirmed that He has ascribed all
who are of the apostasy to him who is the ringleader of this transgression. But He made
neither angels nor men so by nature. For we do not find that the devil created anything
whatsoever, since indeed he is himself a creature of God, like the other angels. For God
made all things, as also David says with regard to all things of the kind: “For He spake the
word, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.”1789</p>
<p>2. Since, therefore, all things were made by God, and since the devil has become the
cause of apostasy to himself and others, justly does the Scripture always term those who
remain in a state of apostasy “sons of the devil” and “angels of the wicked one” (maligni).
For [the word] “son,” as one before me has observed, has a twofold meaning: one [is a son]
in the order of nature, because he was born a son; the other, in that he was made so, is reputed
a son, although there be a difference between being born so and being made so. For the first
is indeed born from the person referred to; but the second is made so by him, whether as
respects his creation or by the teaching of his doctrine. For when any person has been taught
from the mouth of another, he is termed the son of him who instructs him, and the latter
[is called] his father. According to nature, then—that is, according to creation, so to speak—
we are all sons of God, because we have all been created by God. But with respect to obedience
and doctrine we are not all the sons of God: those only are so who believe in Him and do
His will. And those who do not believe, and do not obey His will, are sons and angels of the
devil, because they do the works of the devil. And that such is the case He has declared in
Isaiah: “I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.”1790
And again, where He says that these children are aliens: “Strange children have lied unto
Me.”1791 According to nature, then, they are [His] children, because they have been so created;
but with regard to their works, they are not His children.</p>
<p>3. For as, among men, those sons who disobey their fathers, being disinherited, are still
their sons in the course of nature, but by law are disinherited, for they do not become the
heirs of their natural parents; so in the same way is it with God,—those who do not obey
Him being disinherited by Him, have ceased to be His sons. Wherefore they cannot receive

<pb n="1297"/>
His inheritance: as David says, “Sinners are alienated from the womb; their anger is after
the likeness of a serpent.”1792 And therefore did the Lord term those whom He knew to be
the offspring of men “a generation of vipers;”1793 because after the manner of these animals
they go about in subtilty, and injure others. For He said, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
and of the Sadducees.”1794 Speaking of Herod, too, He says, “Go ye and tell that fox,”1795
aiming at his wicked cunning and deceit. Wherefore the prophet David says, “Man, being
placed in honour, is made like unto cattle.”1796 And again Jeremiah says, “They are become
like horses, furious about females; each one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.”1797 And
Isaiah, when preaching in Judea, and reasoning with Israel, termed them “rulers of Sodom”
and “people of Gomorrah;”1798 intimating that they were like the Sodomites in wickedness,
and that the same description of sins was rife among them, calling them by the same name,
because of the similarity of their conduct. And inasmuch as they were not by nature so
created by God, but had power also to act rightly, the same person said to them, giving them
good counsel, “Wash ye, make you clean; take away iniquity from your souls before mine
eyes; cease from your iniquities.”1799 Thus, no doubt, since they had transgressed and sinned
in the same manner, so did they receive the same reproof as did the Sodomites. But when
they should be converted and come to repentance, and cease from evil, they should have
power to become the sons of God, and to receive the inheritance of immortality which is
given by Him. For this reason, therefore, He has termed those “angels of the devil,” and
“children of the wicked one,”1800 who give heed to the devil, and do his works. But these
are, at the same time, all created by the one and the same God. When, however, they believe
and are subject to God, and go on and keep His doctrine, they are the sons of God; but when
they have apostatized and fallen into transgression, they are ascribed to their chief, the
devil—to him who first became the cause of apostasy to himself, and afterwards to others.</p>
<p>4. Inasmuch as the words of the Lord are numerous, while they all proclaim one and
the same Father, the Creator of this world, it was incumbent also upon me, for their own
sake, to refute by many [arguments] those who are involved in many errors, if by any means,
when they are confuted by many [proofs], they may be converted to the truth and saved.

But it is necessary to subjoin to this composition, in what follows, also the doctrine of Paul

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>In the four preceding books, my very dear friend, which I put forth to thee, all the
heretics have been exposed, and their doctrines brought to light, and these men refuted who
have devised irreligious opinions. [I have accomplished this by adducing] something from
the doctrine peculiar to each of these men, which they have left in their writings, as well as
by using arguments of a more general nature, and applicable to them all.1801 Then I have
pointed out the truth, and shown the preaching of the Church, which the prophets proclaimed
(as I have already demonstrated), but which Christ brought to perfection, and the apostles
have handed down, from whom the Church, receiving [these truths], and throughout all
the world alone preserving them in their integrity (bene), has transmitted them to her sons.
Then also—having disposed of all questions which the heretics propose to us, and having
explained the doctrine of the apostles, and clearly set forth many of those things which were
said and done by the Lord in parables—I shall endeavour, in this the fifth book of the entire
work which treats of the exposure and refutation of knowledge falsely so called, to exhibit
proofs from the rest of the Lord’s doctrine and the apostolical epistles: [thus] complying
with thy demand, as thou didst request of me (since indeed I have been assigned a place in
the ministry of the word); and, labouring by every means in my power to furnish thee with
large assistance against the contradictions of the heretics, as also to reclaim the wanderers
and convert them to the Church of God, to confirm at the same time the minds of the neophytes,
that they may preserve stedfast the faith which they have received, guarded by the
Church in its integrity, in order that they be in no way perverted by those who endeavour
to teach them false doctrines, and lead them away from the truth. It will be incumbent upon
thee, however, and all who may happen to read this writing, to peruse with great attention
what I have already said, that thou mayest obtain a knowledge of the subjects against which
I am contending. For it is thus that thou wilt both controvert them in a legitimate manner,
and wilt be prepared to receive the proofs brought forward against them, casting away their
doctrines as filth by means of the celestial faith; but following the only true and stedfast
Teacher, the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who did, through His transcendent love,
become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself.</p>

<p>1. For in no other way could we have learned the things of God, unless our Master, existing
as the Word, had become man. For no other being had the power of revealing to us
the things of the Father, except His own proper Word. For what other person “knew the
mind of the Lord,” or who else “has become His counsellor?”1802 Again, we could have
learned in no other way than by seeing our Teacher, and hearing His voice with our own
ears, that, having become imitators of His works as well as doers of His words, we may have
communion with Him, receiving increase from the perfect One, and from Him who is prior
to all creation. We —who were but lately created by the only best and good Being, by Him
also who has the gift of immortality, having been formed after His likeness (predestinated,
according to the prescience of the Father, that we, who had as yet no existence, might come
into being), and made the first-fruits of creation1803—have received, in the times known
beforehand, [the blessings of salvation] according to the ministration of the Word, who is
perfect in all things, as the mighty Word, and very man, who, redeeming us by His own
blood in a manner consonant to reason, gave Himself as a redemption for those who had
been led into captivity. And since the apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, and, though we
were by nature the property of the omnipotent God, alienated us contrary to nature, rendering
us its own disciples, the Word of God, powerful in all things, and not defective with regard
to His own justice, did righteously turn against that apostasy, and redeem from it His own
property, not by violent means, as the [apostasy] had obtained dominion over us at the beginning,
when it insatiably snatched away what was not its own, but by means of persuasion,
as became a God of counsel, who does not use violent means to obtain what He desires; so
that neither should justice be infringed upon, nor the ancient handiwork of God go to destruction.
Since the Lord thus has redeemed us through His own blood, giving His soul for
our souls, and His flesh for our flesh,1804 and has also poured out the Spirit of the Father
for the union and communion of God and man, imparting indeed God to men by means
of the Spirit, and, on the other hand, attaching man to God by His own incarnation, and
bestowing upon us at His coming immortality durably and truly, by means of communion
with God,—all the doctrines of the heretics fall to ruin.</p>
<p>2. Vain indeed are those who allege that He appeared in mere seeming. For these things
were not done in appearance only, but in actual reality. But if He did appear as a man, when

He was not a man, neither could the Holy Spirit have rested upon Him,—an occurrence
which did actually take place—as the Spirit is invisible; nor, [in that case], was there any
degree of truth in Him, for He was not that which He seemed to be. But I have already remarked
that Abraham and the other prophets beheld Him after a prophetical manner,
foretelling in vision what should come to pass. If, then, such a being has now appeared in
outward semblance different from what he was in reality, there has been a certain prophetical
vision made to men; and another advent of His must be looked forward to, in which
He shall be such as He has now been seen in a prophetic manner. And I have proved already,
that it is the same thing to say that He appeared merely to outward seeming, and [to affirm]
that He received nothing from Mary. For He would not have been one truly possessing flesh
and blood, by which He redeemed us, unless He had summed up in Himself the ancient
formation of Adam. Vain therefore are the disciples of Valentinus who put forth this opinion,
in order that they may exclude the flesh from salvation, and cast aside what God has fashioned.</p>
<p>3. Vain also are the Ebionites, who do not receive by faith into their soul the union of
God and man, but who remain in the old leaven of [the natural] birth, and who do not
choose to understand that the Holy Ghost came upon Mary, and the power of the Most
High did overshadow her:1805 wherefore also what was generated is a holy thing, and the
Son of the Most High God the Father of all, who effected the incarnation of this being, and
showed forth a new [kind of] generation; that as by the former generation we inherited
death, so by this new generation we might inherit life. Therefore do these men reject the
commixture of the heavenly wine,1806 and wish it to be water of the world only, not receiving
God so as to have union with Him, but they remain in that Adam who had been conquered
and was expelled from Paradise: not considering that as, at the beginning of our formation
in Adam, that breath of life which proceeded from God, having been united to what had
been fashioned, animated the man, and manifested him as a being endowed with reason;
so also, in [the times of] the end, the Word of the Father and the Spirit of God, having become
united with the ancient substance of Adam’s formation, rendered man living and perfect,
receptive of the perfect Father, in order that as in the natural [Adam] we all were dead, so
in the spiritual we may all be made alive.1807 For never at any time did Adam escape the
hands1808 of God, to whom the Father speaking, said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after
Our likeness.” And for this reason in the last times (fine), not by the will of the flesh, nor by

<head>Chapter II.—When Christ visited us in His grace, He did not come to what did
not belong to Him: also, by shedding His true blood for us, and exhibiting to us
His true flesh in the Eucharist, He conferred upon our flesh the capacity of
salvation.</head>
<p>1. And vain likewise are those who say that God came to those things which did not
belong to Him, as if covetous of another’s property; in order that He might deliver up that
man who had been created by another, to that God who had neither made nor formed
anything, but who also was deprived from the beginning of His own proper formation of
men. The advent, therefore, of Him whom these men represent as coming to the things of
others, was not righteous; nor did He truly redeem us by His own blood, if He did not really
become man, restoring to His own handiwork what was said [of it] in the beginning, that
man was made after the image and likeness of God; not snatching away by stratagem the
property of another, but taking possession of His own in a righteous and gracious manner.
As far as concerned the apostasy, indeed, He redeems us righteously from it by His own
blood; but as regards us who have been redeemed, [He does this] graciously. For we have
given nothing to Him previously, nor does He desire anything from us, as if He stood in
need of it; but we do stand in need of fellowship with Him. And for this reason it was that
He graciously poured Himself out, that He might gather us into the bosom of the Father.</p>
<p>2. But vain in every respect are they who despise the entire dispensation of God, and
disallow the salvation of the flesh, and treat with contempt its regeneration, maintaining
that it is not capable of incorruption. But if this indeed do not attain salvation, then neither
did the Lord redeem us with His blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of
His blood, nor the bread which we break the communion of His body.1810 For blood can
only come from veins and flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the substance of man, such
as the Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he redeemed us, as also His apostle
declares, “In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins.”1811
And as we are His members, we are also nourished by means of the creation (and He Himself
grants the creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends rain when He wills1812).
He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own blood, from which
He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the creation) He has established as His
own body, from which He gives increase to our bodies.1813</p>

<p>3. When, therefore, the mingled cup and the manufactured bread receives the Word of
God, and the Eucharist of the blood and the body of Christ is made,1814 from which things
the substance of our flesh is increased and supported, how can they affirm that the flesh is
incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is life eternal, which [flesh] is nourished from
the body and blood of the Lord, and is a member of Him?—even as the blessed Paul declares
in his Epistle to the Ephesians, that “we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
bones.”1815 He does not speak these words of some spiritual and invisible man, for a spirit
has not bones nor flesh;1816 but [he refers to] that dispensation [by which the Lord became]
an actual man, consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones,—that [flesh] which is nourished
by the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from the bread which is His body. And
just as a cutting from the vine planted in the ground fructifies in its season, or as a corn of
wheat falling into the earth and becoming decomposed, rises with manifold increase by the
Spirit of God, who contains all things, and then, through the wisdom of God, serves for the
use of men, and having received the Word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body
and blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and deposited in the earth,
and suffering decomposition there, shall rise at their appointed time, the Word of God
granting them resurrection to the glory of God, even the Father, who freely gives to this
mortal immortality, and to this corruptible incorruption,1817 because the strength of God
is made perfect in weakness,1818 in order that we may never become puffed up, as if we had
life from ourselves, and exalted against God, our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning
by experience that we possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this Being, not
from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory which surrounds God as He
is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but that we may know what God can effect, and what
benefits man receives, and thus never wander from the true comprehension of things as
they are, that is, both with regard to God and with regard to man. And might it not be the
case, perhaps, as I have already observed, that for this purpose God permitted our resolution
into the common dust of mortality,1819 that we, being instructed by every mode, may be
accurate in all things for the future, being ignorant neither of God nor of ourselves?</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The power and glory of God shine forth in the weakness of human
flesh, as He will render our body a participator of the resurrection and of
immortality, although He has formed it from the dust of the earth; He will also
bestow upon it the enjoyment of immortality, just as He grants it this short life
in common with the soul.</head>
<p>  1. The Apostle Paul has, moreover, in the most lucid manner, pointed out that man has
been delivered over to his own infirmity, lest, being uplifted, he might fall away from the
truth. Thus he says in the second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: “And lest I should be lifted
up by the sublimity of the revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me. And upon this I besought the Lord three times, that it
might depart from me. But he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is
made perfect in weakness. Gladly therefore shall I rather glory in infirmities, that the power
of Christ may dwell in me.”1820 What, therefore? (as some may exclaim:) did the Lord wish,
in that case, that His apostles should thus undergo buffeting, and that he should endure
such infirmity? Even so it was; the word says it. For strength is made perfect in weakness,
rendering him a better man who by means of his infirmity becomes acquainted with the
power of God. For how could a man have learned that he is himself an infirm being, and
mortal by nature, but that God is immortal and powerful, unless he had learned by experience
what is in both? For there is nothing evil in learning one’s infirmities by endurance; yea,
rather, it has even the beneficial effect of preventing him from forming an undue opinion
of his own nature (non aberrare in natura sua). But the being lifted up against God, and
taking His glory to one’s self, rendering man ungrateful, has brought much evil upon him.
[And thus, I say, man must learn both things by experience], that he may not be destitute
of truth and love either towards himself or his Creator.1821 But the experience of both
confers upon him the true knowledge as to God and man, and increases his love towards
God. Now, where there exists an increase of love, there a greater glory is wrought out by the
power of God for those who love Him.</p>
<p>2. Those men, therefore, set aside the power of God, and do not consider what the word
declares, when they dwell upon the infirmity of the flesh, but do not take into consideration
the power of Him who raises it up from the dead. For if He does not vivify what is mortal,
and does not bring back the corruptible to incorruption, He is not a God of power. But that
He is powerful in all these respects, we ought to perceive from our origin, inasmuch as God,
taking dust from the earth, formed man. And surely it is much more difficult and incredible,

from non-existent bones, and nerves, and veins, and the rest of man’s organization, to bring
it about that all this should be, and to make man an animated and rational creature, than
to reintegrate again that which had been created and then afterwards decomposed into earth
(for the reasons already mentioned), having thus passed into those [elements] from which
man, who had no previous existence, was formed. For He who in the beginning caused him
to have being who as yet was not, just when He pleased, shall much more reinstate again
those who had a former existence, when it is His will [that they should inherit] the life
granted by Him. And that flesh shall also be found fit for and capable of receiving the power
of God, which at the beginning received the skilful touches of God; so that one part became
the eye for seeing; another, the ear for hearing; another, the hand for feeling and working;
another, the sinews stretched out everywhere, and holding the limbs together; another, arteries
and veins, passages for the blood and the air;1822 another, the various internal organs;
another, the blood, which is the bond of union between soul and body. But why go [on in
this strain]? Numbers would fail to express the multiplicity of parts in the human frame,
which was made in no other way than by the great wisdom of God. But those things which
partake of the skill and wisdom of God, do also partake of His power.</p>
<p>3. The flesh, therefore, is not destitute [of participation] in the constructive wisdom and
power of God. But if the power of Him who is the bestower of life is made perfect in weakness
—that is, in the flesh—let them inform us, when they maintain the incapacity of flesh to
receive the life granted by God, whether they do say these things as being living men at
present, and partakers of life, or acknowledge that, having no part in life whatever, they are
at the present moment dead men. And if they really are dead men, how is it that they move
about, and speak, and perform those other functions which are not the actions of the dead,
but of the living? But if they are now alive, and if their whole body partakes of life, how can
they venture the assertion that the flesh is not qualified to be a partaker of life, when they
do confess that they have life at the present moment? It is just as if anybody were to take up
a sponge full of water, or a torch on fire, and to declare that the sponge could not possibly
partake of the water, or the torch of the fire. In this very manner do those men, by alleging
that they are alive and bear life about in their members, contradict themselves afterwards,
when they represent these members as not being capable of [receiving] life. But if the present
temporal life, which is of such an inferior nature to eternal life, can nevertheless effect so
much as to quicken our mortal members, why should not eternal life, being much more
powerful than this, vivify the flesh, which has already held converse with, and been accustomed
to sustain, life? For that the flesh can really partake of life, is shown from the fact of
its being alive; for it lives on, as long as it is God’s purpose that it should do so. It is manifest,
<note type="footnote">1822 The ancients erroneously supposed that the arteries were air-vessels, from the fact that these organs,
after death, appear quite empty, from all the blood stagnating in the veins when death supervenes.</note>

<pb n="1308"/>
too, that God has the power to confer life upon it, inasmuch as He grants life to us who are
in existence. And, therefore, since the Lord has power to infuse life into what He has fashioned,
and since the flesh is capable of being quickened, what remains to prevent its participating
in incorruption, which is a blissful and never-ending life granted by God?</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Those persons are deceived who feign another God the Father
besides the Creator of the world; for he must have been feeble and useless, or
else malignant and full of envy, if he be either unable or unwilling to extend
external life to our bodies.</head>
<p>1. Those persons who feign the existence of another Father beyond the Creator, and
who term him the good God, do deceive themselves; for they introduce him as a feeble,
worthless, and negligent being, not to say malign and full of envy, inasmuch as they affirm
that our bodies are not quickened by him. For when they say of things which it is manifest
to all do remain immortal, such as the spirit and the soul, and such other things, that they
are quickened by the Father, but that another thing [viz. the body] which is quickened in
no different manner than by God granting [life] to it, is abandoned by life,—[they must
either confess] that this proves their Father to be weak and powerless, or else envious and
malignant. For since the Creator does even here quicken our mortal bodies, and promises
them resurrection by the prophets, as I have pointed out; who [in that case] is shown to be
more powerful, stronger, or truly good? Whether is it the Creator who vivifies the whole
man, or is it their Father, falsely so called? He feigns to be the quickener of those things
which are immortal by nature, to which things life is always present by their very nature;
but he does not benevolently quicken those things which required his assistance, that they
might live, but leaves them carelessly to fall under the power of death. Whether is it the case,
then, that their Father does not bestow life upon them when he has the power of so doing,
or is it that he does not possess the power? If, on the one hand, it is because he cannot, he
is, upon that supposition, not a powerful being, nor is he more perfect than the Creator; for
the Creator grants, as we must perceive, what He is unable to afford. But if, on the other
hand, [it be that he does not grant this] when he has the power of so doing, then he is proved
to be not a good, but an envious and malignant Father.</p>
<p>2. If, again, they refer to any cause on account of which their Father does not impart
life to bodies, then that cause must necessarily appear superior to the Father, since it restrains
Him from the exercise of His benevolence; and His benevolence will thus be proved weak,
on account of that cause which they bring forward. Now every one must perceive that
bodies are capable of receiving life. For they live to the extent that God pleases that they
should live; and that being so, the [heretics] cannot maintain that [these bodies] are utterly
incapable of receiving life. If, therefore, on account of necessity and any other cause, those
[bodies] which are capable of participating in life are not vivified, their Father shall be the
slave of necessity and that cause, and not therefore a free agent, having His will under His
own control.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The prolonged life of the ancients, the translation of Elijah and of
Enoch in their own bodies, as well as the preservation of Jonah, of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, in the midst of extreme peril, are clear demonstrations
that God can raise up our bodies to life eternal.</head>
<p>1. [In order to learn] that bodies did continue in existence for a lengthened period, as
long as it was God’s good pleasure that they should flourish, let [these heretics] read the
Scriptures, and they will find that our predecessors advanced beyond seven hundred, eight
hundred, and nine hundred years of age; and that their bodies kept pace with the protracted
length of their days, and participated in life as long as God willed that they should live. But
why do I refer to these men? For Enoch, when he pleased God, was translated in the same
body in which he did please Him, thus pointing out by anticipation the translation of the
just. Elijah, too, was caught up [when he was yet] in the substance of the [natural] form;
thus exhibiting in prophecy the assumption of those who are spiritual, and that nothing
stood in the way of their body being translated and caught up. For by means of the very
same hands through which they were moulded at the beginning, did they receive this
translation and assumption. For in Adam the hands of God had become accustomed to set
in order, to rule, and to sustain His own workmanship, and to bring it and place it where
they pleased. Where, then, was the first man placed? In paradise certainly, as the Scripture
declares “And God planted a garden [paradisum] eastward in Eden, and there He placed
the man whom He had formed.”1823 And then afterwards when [man] proved disobedient,
he was cast out thence into this world. Wherefore also the elders who were disciples of the
apostles tell us that those who were translated were transferred to that place (for paradise
has been prepared for righteous men, such as have the Spirit; in which place also Paul the
apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are unspeakable as regards us in our
present condition1824), and that there shall they who have been translated remain until the
consummation [of all things], as a prelude to immortality.</p>
<p>2. If, however, any one imagine it impossible that men should survive for such a length
of time, and that Elias was not caught up in the flesh, but that his flesh was consumed in
the fiery chariot, let him consider that Jonah, when he had been cast into the deep, and
swallowed down into the whale’s belly, was by the command of God again thrown out safe
upon the land.1825 And then, again, when Ananias, Azarias, and Mishael were cast into the
furnace of fire sevenfold heated, they sustained no harm whatever, neither was the smell of
fire perceived upon them. As, therefore, the hand of God was present with them, working
out marvellous things in their case—[things] impossible [to be accomplished] by man’s
<note type="footnote">1823 Gen. ii. 8.</note>

<pb n="1311"/>
nature—what wonder was it, if also in the case of those who were translated it performed
something wonderful, working in obedience to the will of God, even the Father? Now this
is the Son of God, as the Scripture represents Nebuchadnezzar the king as having said, “Did
not we cast three men bound into the furnace? and, lo, I do see four walking in the midst
of the fire, and the fourth is like the Son of God.”1826 Neither the nature of any created
thing, therefore, nor the weakness of the flesh, can prevail against the will of God. For God
is not subject to created things, but created things to God; and all things yield obedience to
His will. Wherefore also the Lord declares, “The things which are impossible with men, are
possible with God.”1827 As, therefore, it might seem to the men of the present day, who are
ignorant of God’s appointment, to be a thing incredible and impossible that any man could
live for such a number of years, yet those who were before us did live [to such an age], and
those who were translated do live as an earnest of the future length of days; and [as it might
also appear impossible] that from the whale’s belly and from the fiery furnace men issued
forth unhurt, yet they nevertheless did so, led forth as it were by the hand of God, for the
purpose of declaring His power: so also now, although some, not knowing the power and
promise of God, may oppose their own salvation, deeming it impossible for God, who raises
up the dead; to have power to confer upon them eternal duration, yet the scepticism of men
of this stamp shall not render the faithfulness of God of none effect.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—God will bestow salvation upon the whole nature of man, consisting
of body and soul in close union, since the Word took it upon Him, and adorned
with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, of whom our bodies are, and are termed, the
temples.</head>
<p>1. Now God shall be glorified in His handiwork, fitting it so as to be conformable to,
and modelled after, His own Son. For by the hands of the Father, that is, by the Son and the
Holy Spirit, man, and not [merely] a part of man, was made in the likeness of God. Now
the soul and the spirit are certainly a part of the man, but certainly not the man; for the
perfect man consists in the commingling and the union of the soul receiving the spirit of
the Father, and the admixture of that fleshly nature which was moulded after the image of
God. For this reason does the apostle declare, “We speak wisdom among them that are
perfect,”1828 terming those persons “perfect” who have received the Spirit of God, and who
through the Spirit of God do speak in all languages, as he used Himself also to speak. In like
manner we do also hear1829 many brethren in the Church, who possess prophetic gifts, and
who through the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit
the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of God, whom also the apostle terms
“spiritual,” they being spiritual because they partake of the Spirit, and not because their flesh
has been stripped off and taken away, and because they have become purely spiritual. For
if any one take away the substance of flesh, that is, of the handiwork [of God], and understand
that which is purely spiritual, such then would not be a spiritual man but would be
the spirit of a man, or the Spirit of God. But when the spirit here blended with the soul is
united to [God’s] handiwork, the man is rendered spiritual and perfect because of the outpouring
of the Spirit, and this is he who was made in the image and likeness of God. But if
the Spirit be wanting to the soul, he who is such is indeed of an animal nature, and being
left carnal, shall be an imperfect being, possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation
(in plasmate), but not receiving the similitude through the Spirit; and thus is this being imperfect.
Thus also, if any one take away the image and set aside the handiwork, he cannot
then understand this as being a man, but as either some part of a man, as I have already
said, or as something else than a man. For that flesh which has been moulded is not a perfect
man in itself, but the body of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the soul itself, considered
apart by itself, the man; but it is the soul of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the spirit a
man, for it is called the spirit, and not a man; but the commingling and union of all these
constitutes the perfect man. And for this cause does the apostle, explaining himself, make
it clear that the saved man is a complete man as well as a spiritual man; saying thus in the
first Epistle to the Thessalonians, “Now the God of peace sanctify you perfect (perfectos);
<note type="footnote">1828 1 Cor. ii. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">1829 The old Latin has “audivimus,”have heard.</note>

<pb n="1313"/>
and may your spirit, and soul, and body be preserved whole without complaint to the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.”1830 Now what was his object in praying that these
three—that is, soul, body, and spirit—might be preserved to the coming of the Lord, unless
he was aware of the [future] reintegration and union of the three, and [that they should be
heirs of] one and the same salvation? For this cause also he declares that those are “the
perfect” who present unto the Lord the three [component parts] without offence. Those,
then, are the perfect who have had the Spirit of God remaining in them, and have preserved
their souls and bodies blameless, holding fast the faith of God, that is, that faith which is
[directed] towards God, and maintaining righteous dealings with respect to their neighbours.</p>
<p>2. Whence also he says, that this handiwork is “the temple of God,” thus declaring:
“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If
any man, therefore, will defile the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of
God is holy, which [temple] ye are.”1831 Here he manifestly declares the body to be the
temple in which the Spirit dwells. As also the Lord speaks in reference to Himself, “Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spake this, however,” it is said, “of the
temple of His body.”1832 And not only does he (the apostle) acknowledge our bodies to be
a temple, but even the temple of Christ, saying thus to the Corinthians, “Know ye not that
your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them
the members of an harlot?”1833 He speaks these things, not in reference to some other
spiritual man; for a being of such a nature could have nothing to do with an harlot: but he
declares “our body,” that is, the flesh which continues in sanctity and purity, to be “the
members of Christ;” but that when it becomes one with an harlot, it becomes the members
of an harlot. And for this reason he said, “If any man defile the temple of God, him will God
destroy.” How then is it not the utmost blasphemy to allege, that the temple of God, in which
the Spirit of the Father dwells, and the members of Christ, do not partake of salvation, but
are reduced to perdition? Also, that our bodies are raised not from their own substance, but
by the power of God, he says to the Corinthians, “Now the body is not for fornication, but
for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. But God hath both raised up the Lord, and shall
raise us up by His own power.”1834</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Inasmuch as Christ did rise in our flesh, it follows that we shall
be also raised in the same; since the resurrection promised to us should not be
referred to spirits naturally immortal, but to bodies in themselves mortal.</head>
<p>1. In the same manner, therefore, as Christ did rise in the substance of flesh, and pointed
out to His disciples the mark of the nails and the opening in His side1835 (now these are the
tokens of that flesh which rose from the dead), so “shall He also,” it is said, “raise us up by
His own power.”1836 And again to the Romans he says, “But if the Spirit of Him that raised
up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also
quicken your mortal bodies.”1837 What, then, are mortal bodies? Can they be souls? Nay,
for souls are incorporeal when put in comparison with mortal bodies; for God “breathed
into the face of man the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” Now the breath of
life is an incorporeal thing. And certainly they cannot maintain that the very breath of life
is mortal. Therefore David says, “My soul also shall live to Him,”1838 just as if its substance
were immortal. Neither, on the other hand, can they say that the spirit is the mortal body.
What therefore is there left to which we may apply the term “mortal body,” unless it be the
thing that was moulded, that is, the flesh, of which it is also said that God will vivify it? For
this it is which dies and is decomposed, but not the soul or the spirit. For to die is to lose
vital power, and to become henceforth breathless, inanimate, and devoid of motion, and to
melt away into those [component parts] from which also it derived the commencement of
[its] substance. But this event happens neither to the soul, for it is the breath of life; nor to
the spirit, for the spirit is simple and not composite, so that it cannot be decomposed, and
is itself the life of those who receive it. We must therefore conclude that it is in reference to
the flesh that death is mentioned; which [flesh], after the soul’s departure, becomes breathless
and inanimate, and is decomposed gradually into the earth from which it was taken. This,
then, is what is mortal. And it is this of which he also says, “He shall also quicken your
mortal bodies.” And therefore in reference to it he says, in the first [Epistle] to the Corinthians:
“So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it rises in incorruption.”
1839 For he declares, “That which thou sowest cannot be quickened, unless first it
die.”1840</p>
<p>2. But what is that which, like a grain of wheat, is sown in the earth and decays, unless
it be the bodies which are laid in the earth, into which seeds are also cast? And for this

reason he said, “It is sown in dishonour, it rises in glory.”1841 For what is more ignoble than
dead flesh? Or, on the other hand, what is more glorious than the same when it arises and
partakes of incorruption? “It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:”1842 in its own
weakness certainly, because since it is earth it goes to earth; but [it is quickened] by the
power of God, who raises it from the dead. “It is sown an animal body, it rises a spiritual
body.”1843 He has taught, beyond all doubt, that such language was not used by him, either
with reference to the soul or to the spirit, but to bodies that have become corpses. For these
are animal bodies, that is, [bodies] which partake of life, which when they have lost, they
succumb to death; then, rising through the Spirit’s instrumentality, they become spiritual
bodies, so that by the Spirit they possess a perpetual life. “For now,” he says, “we know in
part, and we prophesy in part, but then face to face.”1844 And this it is which has been said
also by Peter: “Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom now also, not seeing, ye believe;
and believing, ye shall rejoice with joy unspeakable.”1845 For our face shall see the face of
the Lord1846 and shall rejoice with joy unspeakable,—that is to say, when it shall behold its
own Delight.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The gifts of the Holy Spirit which we receive prepare us for
incorruption, render us spiritual, and separate us from carnal men. These two
classes are signified by the clean and unclean animals in the legal dispensation.</head>
<p>1. But we do now receive a certain portion of His Spirit, tending towards perfection,
and preparing us for incorruption, being little by little accustomed to receive and bear God;
which also the apostle terms “an earnest,” that is, a part of the honour which has been
promised us by God, where he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians, “In which ye also, having
heard the word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation, believing in which we have been sealed
with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance.”1847 This earnest,
therefore, thus dwelling in us, renders us spiritual even now, and the mortal is swallowed
up by immortality.1848 “For ye,” he declares, “are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be
that the Spirit of God dwell in you.”1849 This, however, does not take place by a casting away
of the flesh, but by the impartation of the Spirit. For those to whom he was writing were
not without flesh, but they were those who had received the Spirit of God, “by which we
cry, Abba, Father.”1850 If therefore, at the present time, having the earnest, we do cry, “Abba,
Father,” what shall it be when, on rising again, we behold Him face to face; when all the
members shall burst out into a continuous hymn of triumph, glorifying Him who raised
them from the dead, and gave the gift of eternal life? For if the earnest, gathering man into
itself, does even now cause him to cry, “Abba, Father,” what shall the complete grace of the
Spirit effect, which shall be given to men by God? It will render us like unto Him, and accomplish
the will1851 of the Father; for it shall make man after the image and likeness of
God.</p>
<p>2. Those persons, then, who possess the earnest of the Spirit, and who are not enslaved
by the lusts of the flesh, but are subject to the Spirit, and who in all things walk according
to the light of reason, does the apostle properly term “spiritual,” because the Spirit of God
dwells in them. Now, spiritual men shall not be incorporeal spirits; but our substance, that
is, the union of flesh and spirit, receiving the Spirit of God, makes up the spiritual man. But
those who do indeed reject the Spirit’s counsel, and are the slaves of fleshly lusts, and lead
lives contrary to reason, and who, without restraint, plunge headlong into their own desires,
having no longing after the Divine Spirit, do live after the manner of swine and of dogs;
these men, [I say], does the apostle very properly term “carnal,” because they have no thought
of anything else except carnal things.</p>

<p>3. For the same reason, too, do the prophets compare them to irrational animals, on
account of the irrationality of their conduct, saying, “They have become as horses raging
for the females; each one of them neighing after his neighbour’s wife.”1852 And again, “Man,
when he was in honour, was made like unto cattle.”1853 This denotes that, for his own fault,
he is likened to cattle, by rivalling their irrational life. And we also, as the custom is, do
designate men of this stamp as cattle and irrational beasts.</p>
<p>4. Now the law has figuratively predicted all these, delineating man by the [various]
animals:1854 whatsoever of these, says [the Scripture], have a double hoof and ruminate, it
proclaims as clean; but whatsoever of them do not possess one or other of these [properties],
it sets aside by themselves as unclean. Who then are the clean? Those who make their way
by faith steadily towards the Father and the Son; for this is denoted by the steadiness of
those which divide the hoof; and they meditate day and night upon the words of God,1855
that they may be adorned with good works: for this is the meaning of the ruminants. The
unclean, however, are those which do neither divide the hoof nor ruminate; that is, those
persons who have neither faith in God, nor do meditate on His words: and such is the abomination
of the Gentiles. But as to those animals which do indeed chew the cud, but have
not the double hoof, and are themselves unclean, we have in them a figurative description
of the Jews, who certainly have the words of God in their mouth, but who do not fix their
rooted stedfastness in the Father and in the Son; wherefore they are an unstable generation.
For those animals which have the hoof all in one piece easily slip; but those which have it
divided are more sure-footed, their cleft hoofs succeeding each other as they advance, and
the one hoof supporting the other. In like manner, too, those are unclean which have the
double hoof but do not ruminate: this is plainly an indication of all heretics, and of those
who do not meditate on the words of God, neither are adorned with works of righteousness;
to whom also the Lord says, “Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say
to you?”1856 For men of this stamp do indeed say that they believe in the Father and the
Son, but they never meditate as they should upon the things of God, neither are they adorned
with works of righteousness; but, as I have already observed, they have adopted the lives of
swine and of dogs, giving themselves over to filthiness, to gluttony, and recklessness of all
sorts. Justly, therefore, did the apostle call all such “carnal” and “animal,”1857 —[all those,
namely], who through their own unbelief and luxury do not receive the Divine Spirit, and

<head>Chapter IX.—Showing how that passage of the apostle which the heretics pervert,
should be understood; viz., “Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of
God.”</head>
<p>1. Among the other [truths] proclaimed by the apostle, there is also this one, “That flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”1858 This is [the passage] which is adduced
by all the heretics in support of their folly, with an attempt to annoy us, and to point out
that the handiwork of God is not saved. They do not take this fact into consideration, that
there are three things out of which, as I have shown, the complete man is composed —flesh,
soul, and spirit. One of these does indeed preserve and fashion [the man]—this is the spirit;
while as to another it is united and formed—that is the flesh; then [comes] that which is
between these two—that is the soul, which sometimes indeed, when it follows the spirit, is
raised up by it, but sometimes it sympathizes with the flesh, and falls into carnal lusts. Those
then, as many as they be, who have not that which saves and forms [us] into life [eternal],
shall be, and shall be called, [mere] flesh and blood; for these are they who have not the
Spirit of God in themselves. Wherefore men of this stamp are spoken of by the Lord as
“dead;” for, says He, “Let the dead bury their dead,”1859 because they have not the Spirit
which quickens man.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand, as many as fear God and trust in His Son’s advent, and who
through faith do establish the Spirit of God in their hearts,—such men as these shall be
properly called both “pure,” and “spiritual,” and “those living to God,” because they possess
the Spirit of the Father, who purifies man, and raises him up to the life of God. For as the
Lord has testified that “the flesh is weak,” so [does He also say] that “the spirit is willing.”1860
For this latter is capable of working out its own suggestions. If, therefore, any one admix
the ready inclination of the Spirit to be, as it were, a stimulus to the infirmity of the flesh, it
inevitably follows that what is strong will prevail over the weak, so that the weakness of the
flesh will be absorbed by the strength of the Spirit; and that the man in whom this takes
place cannot in that case be carnal, but spiritual, because of the fellowship of the Spirit. Thus
it is, therefore, that the martyrs bear their witness, and despise death, not after the infirmity
of the flesh, but because of the readiness of the Spirit. For when the infirmity of the flesh is
absorbed, it exhibits the Spirit as powerful; and again, when the Spirit absorbs the weakness
[of the flesh], it possesses the flesh as an inheritance in itself, and from both of these is
formed a living man,—living, indeed, because he partakes of the Spirit, but man, because
of the substance of flesh.</p>

<pb n="1320"/>
<p>3. The flesh, therefore, when destitute of the Spirit of God, is dead, not having life, and
cannot possess the kingdom of God: [it is as] irrational blood, like water poured out upon
the ground. And therefore he says, “As is the earthy, such are they that are earthy.”1861 But
where the Spirit of the Father is, there is a living man; [there is] the rational blood preserved
by God for the avenging [of those that shed it]; [there is] the flesh possessed by the Spirit,
forgetful indeed of what belongs to it, and adopting the quality of the Spirit, being made
conformable to the Word of God. And on this account he (the apostle) declares, “As we
have borne the image of him who is of the earth, we shall also bear the image of Him who
is from heaven.”1862 What, therefore, is the earthly? That which was fashioned. And what
is the heavenly? The Spirit. As therefore he says, when we were destitute of the celestial
Spirit, we walked in former times in the oldness of the flesh, not obeying God; so now let
us, receiving the Spirit, walk in newness of life, obeying God. Inasmuch, therefore, as without
the Spirit of God we cannot be saved, the apostle exhorts us through faith and chaste conversation
to preserve the Spirit of God, lest, having become non-participators of the Divine
Spirit, we lose the kingdom of heaven; and he exclaims, that flesh in itself, and blood, cannot
possess the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>4. If, however, we must speak strictly, [we would say that] the flesh does not inherit, but
is inherited; as also the Lord declares, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth
by inheritance;”1863 as if in the [future] kingdom, the earth, from whence exists the substance
of our flesh, is to be possessed by inheritance. This is the reason for His wishing the temple
(i.e., the flesh) to be clean, that the Spirit of God may take delight therein, as a bridegroom
with a bride. As, therefore, the bride cannot [be said] to wed, but to be wedded, when the
bridegroom comes and takes her, so also the flesh cannot by itself possess the kingdom of
God by inheritance; but it can be taken for an inheritance into the kingdom of God. For a
living person inherits the goods of the deceased; and it is one thing to inherit, another to be
inherited. The former rules, and exercises power over, and orders the things inherited at
his will; but the latter things are in a state of subjection, are under order, and are ruled over
by him who has obtained the inheritance. What, therefore, is it that lives? The Spirit of God,
doubtless. What, again, are the possessions of the deceased? The various parts of the man,
surely, which rot in the earth. But these are inherited by the Spirit when they are translated
into the kingdom of heaven. For this cause, too, did Christ die, that the Gospel covenant
being manifested and known to the whole world, might in the first place set free His slaves;
and then afterwards, as I have already shown, might constitute them heirs of His property,
when the Spirit possesses them by inheritance. For he who lives inherits, but the flesh is in-

herited. In order that we may not lose life by losing that Spirit which possesses us, the apostle,
exhorting us to the communion of the Spirit, has said, according to reason, in those words
already quoted, “That flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” Just as if he were
to say, “Do not err; for unless the Word of God dwell with, and the Spirit of the Father be
in you, and if ye shall live frivolously and carelessly as if ye were this only, viz., mere flesh
and blood, ye cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>

<head>Chapter X.—By a comparison drawn from the wild olive-tree, whose quality but
not whose nature is changed by grafting, he proves more important things; he
points out also that man without the Spirit is not capable of bringing forth fruit,
or of inheriting the kingdom of God.</head>
<p>1. This truth, therefore, [he declares], in order that we may not reject the engrafting of
the Spirit while pampering the flesh. “But thou, being a wild olive-tree,” he says, “hast been
grafted into the good olive-tree, and been made a partaker of the fatness of the olive-tree.”1864
As, therefore, when the wild olive has been engrafted, if it remain in its former condition,
viz., a wild olive, it is “cut off, and cast into the fire;”1865 but if it takes kindly to the graft,
and is changed into the good olive-tree, it becomes a fruit-bearing olive, planted, as it were,
in a king’s park (paradiso): so likewise men, if they do truly progress by faith towards better
things, and receive the Spirit of God, and bring forth the fruit thereof, shall be spiritual, as
being planted in the paradise of God. But if they cast out the Spirit, and remain in their
former condition, desirous of being of the flesh rather than of the Spirit, then it is very justly
said with regard to men of this stamp, “That flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom
of God;”1866 just as if any one were to say that the wild olive is not received into the paradise
of God. Admirably therefore does the apostle exhibit our nature, and God’s universal appointment,
in his discourse about flesh and blood and the wild olive. For as the good olive,
if neglected for a certain time, if left to grow wild and to run to wood, does itself become a
wild olive; or again, if the wild olive be carefully tended and grafted, it naturally reverts to
its former fruit-bearing condition: so men also, when they become careless, and bring forth
for fruit the lusts of the flesh like woody produce, are rendered, by their own fault, unfruitful
in righteousness. For when men sleep, the enemy sows the material of tares;1867 and for this
cause did the Lord command His disciples to be on the watch.1868 And again, those persons
who are not bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, and are, as it were, covered over and
lost among brambles, if they use diligence, and receive the word of God as a graft,1869 arrive
at the pristine nature of man—that which was created after the image and likeness of God.</p>
<p>2. But as the engrafted wild olive does not certainly lose the substance of its wood, but
changes the quality of its fruit, and receives another name, being now not a wild olive, but
a fruit-bearing olive, and is called so; so also, when man is grafted in by faith and receives
the Spirit of God, he certainly does not lose the substance of flesh, but changes the quality

of the fruit [brought forth, i.e.,] of his works, and receives another name,1870 showing that
he has become changed for the better, being now not [mere] flesh and blood, but a spiritual
man, and is called such. Then, again, as the wild olive, if it be not grafted in, remains useless
to its lord because of its woody quality, and is cut down as a tree bearing no fruit, and cast
into the fire; so also man, if he does not receive through faith the engrafting of the Spirit,
remains in his old condition, and being [mere] flesh and blood, he cannot inherit the kingdom
of God. Rightly therefore does the apostle declare, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God;”1871 and, “Those who are in the flesh cannot please God:”1872 not repudiating
[by these words] the substance of flesh, but showing that into it the Spirit must be infused.
1873 And for this reason, he says, “This mortal must put on immortality, and this
corruptible must put on incorruption.”1874 And again he declares, “But ye are not in the
flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.”1875 He sets this forth
still more plainly, where he says, “The body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the Spirit is
life, because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead
dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies,
because of His Spirit dwelling in you.”1876 And again he says, in the Epistle to the Romans,
“For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.”1877 [Now by these words] he does not prohibit
them from living their lives in the flesh, for he was himself in the flesh when he wrote to
them; but he cuts away the lusts of the flesh, those which bring death upon a man. And for
this reason he says in continuation, “But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the works of
the flesh, ye shall live. For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.”</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Treats upon the actions of carnal and of spiritual persons; also,
that the spiritual cleansing is not to be referred to the substance of our bodies,
but to the manner of our former life.</head>
<p>1. [The apostle], foreseeing the wicked speeches of unbelievers, has particularized the
works which he terms carnal; and he explains himself, lest any room for doubt be left to
those who do dishonestly pervert his meaning, thus saying in the Epistle to the Galatians:
“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are adulteries, fornications, uncleanness,
luxuriousness, idolatries, witchcrafts,1878 hatreds, contentions, jealousies, wraths, emulations,
animosities, irritable speeches, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, carousings,
and such like; of which I warn you, as also I have warned you, that they who do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”1879 Thus does he point out to his hearers in a more
explicit manner what it is [he means when he declares], “Flesh and blood shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.” For they who do these things, since they do indeed walk after the
flesh, have not the power of living unto God. And then, again, he proceeds to tell us the
spiritual actions which vivify a man, that is, the engrafting of the Spirit; thus saying, “But
the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, benignity, faith, meekness,
continence, chastity: against these there is no law.”1880 As, therefore, he who has gone forward
to the better things, and has brought forth the fruit of the Spirit, is saved altogether because
of the communion of the Spirit; so also he who has continued in the aforesaid works of the
flesh, being truly reckoned as carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God, shall not
have power to inherit the kingdom of heaven. As, again, the same apostle testifies, saying
to the Corinthians, “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
Do not err,” he says: “neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor
abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor rapacious

washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.”1881 He shows in the clearest manner through what
things it is that man goes to destruction, if he has continued to live after the flesh; and then,
on the other hand, [he points out] through what things he is saved. Now he says that the
things which save are the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>2. Since, therefore, in that passage he recounts those works of the flesh which are without
the Spirit, which bring death [upon their doers], he exclaimed at the end of his Epistle, in
accordance with what he had already declared, “And as we have borne the image of him

who is of the earth, we shall also bear the image of Him who is from heaven. For this I say,
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”1882 Now this which he
says, “as we have borne the image of him who is of the earth,” is analogous to what has been
declared, “And such indeed ye were; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified,
but ye have been justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.”
When, therefore, did we bear the image of him who is of the earth? Doubtless it was when
those actions spoken of as “works of the flesh” used to be wrought in us. And then, again,
when [do we bear] the image of the heavenly? Doubtless when he says, “Ye have been
washed,” believing in the name of the Lord, and receiving His Spirit. Now we have washed
away, not the substance of our body, nor the image of our [primary] formation, but the
former vain conversation. In these members, therefore, in which we were going to destruction
by working the works of corruption, in these very members are we made alive by working
the works of the Spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Of the difference between life and death; of the breath of life and
the vivifying Spirit: also how it is that the substance of flesh revives which once
was dead.</head>
<p>1. For as the flesh is capable of corruption, so is it also of incorruption; and as it is of
death, so is it also of life. These two do mutually give way to each other; and both cannot
remain in the same place, but one is driven out by the other, and the presence of the one
destroys that of the other. If, then, when death takes possession of a man, it drives life away
from him, and proves him to be dead, much more does life, when it has obtained power
over the man, drive out death, and restore him as living unto God. For if death brings
mortality, why should not life, when it comes, vivify man? Just as Esaias the prophet says,
“Death devoured when it had prevailed.”1883 And again, “God has wiped away every tear
from every face.” Thus that former life is expelled, because it was not given by the Spirit,
but by the breath.</p>
<p>2. For the breath of life, which also rendered man an animated being, is one thing, and
the vivifying Spirit another, which also caused him to become spiritual. And for this reason
Isaiah said, “Thus saith the Lord, who made heaven and established it, who founded the
earth and the things therein, and gave breath to the people upon it, and Spirit to those
walking upon it;”1884 thus telling us that breath is indeed given in common to all people
upon earth, but that the Spirit is theirs alone who tread down earthly desires. And therefore
Isaiah himself, distinguishing the things already mentioned, again exclaims, “For the Spirit
shall go forth from Me, and I have made every breath.”1885 Thus does he attribute the
Spirit as peculiar to God which in the last times He pours forth upon the human race by the
adoption of sons; but [he shows] that breath was common throughout the creation, and
points it out as something created. Now what has been made is a different thing from him
who makes it. The breath, then, is temporal, but the Spirit eternal. The breath, too, increases
[in strength] for a short period, and continues for a certain time; after that it takes its departure,
leaving its former abode destitute of breath. But when the Spirit pervades the man
within and without, inasmuch as it continues there, it never leaves him. “But that is not first
which is spiritual,” says the apostle, speaking this as if with reference to us human beings;
“but that is first which is animal, afterwards that which is spiritual,”1886 in accordance with
reason. For there had been a necessity that, in the first place, a human being should be
fashioned, and that what was fashioned should receive the soul; afterwards that it should
thus receive the communion of the Spirit. Wherefore also “the first Adam was made” by

<pb n="1327"/>
the Lord “a living soul, the second Adam a quickening spirit.”1887 As, then, he who was
made a living soul forfeited life when he turned aside to what was evil, so, on the other hand,
the same individual, when he reverts to what is good, and receives the quickening Spirit,
shall find life.</p>
<p>3. For it is not one thing which dies and another which is quickened, as neither is it one
thing which is lost and another which is found, but the Lord came seeking for that same
sheep which had been lost. What was it, then, which was dead? Undoubtedly it was the
substance of the flesh; the same, too, which had lost the breath of life, and had become
breathless and dead. This same, therefore, was what the Lord came to quicken, that as in
Adam we do all die, as being of an animal nature, in Christ we may all live, as being spiritual,
not laying aside God’s handiwork, but the lusts of the flesh, and receiving the Holy Spirit;
as the apostle says in the Epistle to the Colossians: “Mortify, therefore, your members which
are upon the earth.” And what these are he himself explains: “Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
affection, evil concupiscence; and covetousness, which is idolatry.”1888 The laying
aside of these is what the apostle preaches; and he declares that those who do such things,
as being merely flesh and blood, cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven. For their soul,
tending towards what is worse, and descending to earthly lusts, has become a partaker in
the same designation which belongs to these [lusts, viz., “earthly”], which, when the apostle
commands us to lay aside, he says in the same Epistle, “Cast ye off the old man with his
deeds.”1889 But when he said this, he does not remove away the ancient formation [of man];
for in that case it would be incumbent on us to rid ourselves of its company by committing
suicide.</p>
<p>4. But the apostle himself also, being one who had been formed in a womb, and had issued
thence, wrote to us, and confessed in his Epistle to the Philippians that “to live in the
flesh was the fruit of [his] work;”1890 thus expressing himself. Now the final result of the
work of the Spirit is the salvation of the flesh.1891 For what other visible fruit is there of the
invisible Spirit, than the rendering of the flesh mature and capable of incorruption? If then
[he says], “To live in the flesh, this is the result of labour to me,” he did not surely contemn
the substance of flesh in that passage where he said, “Put ye off the old man with his
works;”1892 but he points out that we should lay aside our former conversation, that which
waxes old and becomes corrupt; and for this reason he goes on to say, “And put ye on the

new man, that which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him who created him.”
In this, therefore, that he says, “which is renewed in knowledge,” he demonstrates that he,
the selfsame man who was in ignorance in times past, that is, in ignorance of God, is renewed
by that knowledge which has respect to Him. For the knowledge of God renews man. And
when he says, “after the image of the Creator,” he sets forth the recapitulation of the same
man, who was at the beginning made after the likeness of God.</p>
<p>5. And that he, the apostle, was the very same person who had been born from the
womb, that is, of the ancient substance of flesh, he does himself declare in the Epistle to the
Galatians: “But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called
me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles,”1893
it was not, as I have already observed, one person who had been born from the womb, and
another who preached the Gospel of the Son of God; but that same individual who formerly
was ignorant, and used to persecute the Church, when the revelation was made to him from
heaven, and the Lord conferred with him, as I have pointed out in the third book,1894
preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
his former ignorance being driven out by his subsequent knowledge: just as the blind men
whom the Lord healed did certainly lose their blindness, but received the substance of their
eyes perfect, and obtained the power of vision in the very same eyes with which they formerly
did not see; the darkness being merely driven away by the power of vision, while the substance
of the eyes was retained, in order that, by means of those eyes through which they had not
seen, exercising again the visual power, they might give thanks to Him who had restored
them again to sight. And thus, also, he whose withered hand was healed, and all who were
healed generally, did not change those parts of their bodies which had at their birth come
forth from the womb, but simply obtained these anew in a healthy condition.</p>
<p>6. For the Maker of all things, the Word of God, who did also from the beginning form
man, when He found His handiwork impaired by wickedness, performed upon it all kinds
of healing. At one time [He did so], as regards each separate member, as it is found in His
own handiwork; and at another time He did once for all restore man sound and whole in
all points, preparing him perfect for Himself unto the resurrection. For what was His object
in healing [different] portions of the flesh, and restoring them to their original condition,
if those parts which had been healed by Him were not in a position to obtain salvation? For
if it was [merely] a temporary benefit which He conferred, He granted nothing of importance
to those who were the subjects of His healing. Or how can they maintain that the flesh is
incapable of receiving the life which flows from Him, when it received healing from Him?
For life is brought about through healing, and incorruption through life. He, therefore, who

<head>Chapter XIII.—In the dead who were raised by Christ we possess the highest
proof of the resurrection; and our hearts are shown to be capable of life eternal,
because they can now receive the Spirit of God.</head>
<p>1. Let our opponents—that is, they who speak against their own salvation—inform us
[as to this point]: The deceased daughter of the high priest;1895 the widow’s dead son, who
was being carried out [to burial] near the gate [of the city];1896 and Lazarus, who had lain
four days in the tomb,1897—in what bodies did they rise again? In those same, no doubt, in
which they had also died. For if it were not in the very same, then certainly those same individuals
who had died did not rise again. For [the Scripture] says, “The Lord took the hand
of the dead man, and said to him, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And the dead man sat
up, and He commanded that something should be given him to eat; and He delivered him
to his mother.”1898 Again, He called Lazarus “with a loud voice, saying, Lazarus, come forth;
and he that was dead came forth bound with bandages, feet and hands.” This was symbolical
of that man who had been bound in sins. And therefore the Lord said, “Loose him, and let
him depart.” As, therefore, those who were healed were made whole in those members
which had in times past been afflicted; and the dead rose in the identical bodies, their limbs
and bodies receiving health, and that life which was granted by the Lord, who prefigures
eternal things by temporal, and shows that it is He who is Himself able to extend both
healing and life to His handiwork, that His words concerning its [future] resurrection may
also be believed; so also at the end, when the Lord utters His voice “by the last trumpet,”1899
the dead shall be raised, as He Himself declares: “The hour shall come, in which all the dead
which are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and shall come forth; those
that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection
of judgment.”1900</p>
<p>2. Vain, therefore, and truly miserable, are those who do not choose to see what is so
manifest and clear, but shun the light of truth, blinding themselves like the tragic OEdipus.
And as those who are not practised in wrestling, when they contend with others, laying hold
with a determined grasp of some part of [their opponent’s] body, really fall by means of that
which they grasp, yet when they fall, imagine that they are gaining the victory, because they

have obstinately kept their hold upon that part which they seized at the outset, and besides
falling, become subjects of ridicule; so is it with respect to that [favourite] expression of the
heretics: “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;” while taking two expressions
of Paul’s, without having perceived the apostle’s meaning, or examined critically the force
of the terms, but keeping fast hold of the mere expressions by themselves, they die in consequence
of their influence (περὶ αὐτάς), overturning as far as in them lies the entire dispensation
of God.</p>
<p>3. For thus they will allege that this passage refers to the flesh strictly so called, and not
to fleshly works, as I have pointed out, so representing the apostle as contradicting himself.
For immediately following, in the same Epistle, he says conclusively, speaking thus in reference
to the flesh: “For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
on immortality. So, when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought
to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O death, where is thy victory?”1901 Now these words shall be appropriately said at
the time when this mortal and corruptible flesh, which is subject to death, which also is
pressed down by a certain dominion of death, rising up into life, shall put on incorruption
and immortality. For then, indeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh which
is held down by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to the Philippians he
says: “But our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus, who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation conformable to the body of His
glory, even as He is able (ita ut possit) according to the working of His own power.”1902
What, then, is this “body of humiliation” which the Lord shall transfigure, [so as to be]
conformed to “the body of His glory?” Plainly it is this body composed of flesh, which is
indeed humbled when it falls into the earth. Now its transformation [takes place thus], that
while it is mortal and corruptible, it becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after its own
proper substance, but after the mighty working of the Lord, who is able to invest the mortal
with immortality, and the corruptible with incorruption. And therefore he says,1903 “that
mortality may be swallowed up of life. He who has perfected us for this very thing is God,
who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.”1904 He uses these words most manifestly
in reference to the flesh; for the soul is not mortal, neither is the spirit. Now, what is mortal
shall be swallowed up of life, when the flesh is dead no longer, but remains living and incor-

ruptible, hymning the praises of God, who has perfected us for this very thing. In order,
therefore, that we may be perfected for this, aptly does he say to the Corinthians, “Glorify
God in your body.”1905 Now God is He who gives rise to immortality.</p>
<p>4. That he uses these words with respect to the body of flesh, and to none other, he declares
to the Corinthians manifestly, indubitably, and free from all ambiguity: “Always
bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus,1906 that also the life of Jesus Christ might be
manifested in our body. For if we who live are delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, it is that
the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh.”1907 And that the Spirit lays
hold on the flesh, he says in the same Epistle, “That ye are the epistle of Christ, ministered
by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone,
but in the fleshly tables of the heart.”1908 If, therefore, in the present time, fleshly hearts are
made partakers of the Spirit, what is there astonishing if, in the resurrection, they receive
that life which is granted by the Spirit? Of which resurrection the apostle speaks in the Epistle
to the Philippians: “Having been made conformable to His death, if by any means I might
attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.”1909 In what other mortal flesh, therefore,
can life be understood as being manifested, unless in that substance which is also put to
death on account of that confession which is made of God? —as he has himself declared,
“If, as a man, I have fought with beasts1910 at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the dead
rise not? For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ risen. Now, if Christ has not risen, our
preaching is vain, and your faith is vain. In that case, too, we are found false witnesses for
God, since we have testified that He raised up Christ, whom [upon that supposition] He
did not raise up.1911 For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ risen. But if Christ be not
risen, your faith is vain, since ye are yet in your sins. Therefore those who have fallen asleep
in Christ have perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable
than all men. But now Christ has risen from the dead, the first-fruits of those that sleep; for
as by man [came] death, by man also [came] the resurrection of the dead.”1912</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Unless the flesh were to be saved, the Word would not have taken
upon Him flesh of the same substance as ours: from this it would follow that
neither should we have been reconciled by Him.</head>
<p>1. And inasmuch as the apostle has not pronounced against the very substance of flesh
and blood, that it cannot inherit the kingdom of God, the same apostle has everywhere adopted
the term “flesh and blood” with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ, partly indeed to establish
His human nature (for He did Himself speak of Himself as the Son of man), and
partly that He might confirm the salvation of our flesh. For if the flesh were not in a position
to be saved, the Word of God would in no wise have become flesh. And if the blood of the
righteous were not to be inquired after, the Lord would certainly not have had blood [in
His composition]. But inasmuch as blood cries out (vocalis est) from the beginning [of the
world], God said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, “The voice of thy brother’s blood
crieth to Me.”1915 And as their blood will be inquired after, He said to those with Noah,
“For your blood of your souls will I require, [even] from the hand of all beasts;”1916 and
again, “Whosoever will shed man’s blood,1917 it shall be shed for his blood.” In like manner,
too, did the Lord say to those who should afterwards shed His blood, “All righteous blood
shall be required which is shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood
of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I
say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.”1918 He thus points out the
recapitulation that should take place in his own person of the effusion of blood from the
beginning, of all the righteous men and of the prophets, and that by means of Himself there
should be a requisition of their blood. Now this [blood] could not be required unless it also
had the capability of being saved; nor would the Lord have summed up these things in
Himself, unless He had Himself been made flesh and blood after the way of the original
formation [of man], saving in his own person at the end that which had in the beginning
perished in Adam.</p>
<p>2. But if the Lord became incarnate for any other order of things, and took flesh of any
other substance, He has not then summed up human nature in His own person, nor in that
case can He be termed flesh. For flesh has been truly made [to consist in] a transmission of
that thing moulded originally from the dust. But if it had been necessary for Him to draw
the material [of His body] from another substance, the Father would at the beginning have
moulded the material [of flesh] from a different substance [than from what He actually did].
But now the case stands thus, that the Word has saved that which really was [created, viz.,]

humanity which had perished, effecting by means of Himself that communion which should
be held with it, and seeking out its salvation. But the thing which had perished possessed
flesh and blood. For the Lord, taking dust from the earth, moulded man; and it was upon
his behalf that all the dispensation of the Lord’s advent took place. He had Himself, therefore,
flesh and blood, recapitulating in Himself not a certain other, but that original handiwork
of the Father, seeking out that thing which had perished. And for this cause the apostle, in
the Epistle to the Colossians, says, “And though ye were formerly alienated, and enemies
to His knowledge by evil works, yet now ye have been reconciled in the body of His flesh,
through His death, to present yourselves holy and chaste, and without fault in His sight.”1919
He says, “Ye have been reconciled in the body of His flesh,” because the righteous flesh has
reconciled that flesh which was being kept under bondage in sin, and brought it into
friendship with God.</p>
<p>3. If, then, any one allege that in this respect the flesh of the Lord was different from
ours, because it indeed did not commit sin, neither was deceit found in His soul, while we,
on the other hand, are sinners, he says what is the fact. But if he pretends that the Lord
possessed another substance of flesh, the sayings respecting reconciliation will not agree
with that man. For that thing is reconciled which had formerly been in enmity. Now, if the
Lord had taken flesh from another substance, He would not, by so doing, have reconciled
that one to God which had become inimical through transgression. But now, by means of
communion with Himself, the Lord has reconciled man to God the Father, in reconciling
us to Himself by the body of His own flesh, and redeeming us by His own blood, as the
apostle says to the Ephesians, “In whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission
of sins;”1920 and again to the same he says, “Ye who formerly were far off have been
brought near in the blood of Christ;”1921 and again, “Abolishing in His flesh the enmities,
[even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances.”1922 And in every Epistle the
apostle plainly testifies, that through the flesh of our Lord, and through His blood, we have
been saved.</p>
<p>4. If, therefore, flesh and blood are the things which procure for us life, it has not been
declared of flesh and blood, in the literal meaning (proprie) of the terms, that they cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; but [these words apply] to those carnal deeds already mentioned,
which, perverting man to sin, deprive him of life. And for this reason he says, in the Epistle
to the Romans: “Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, to be under its control:
neither yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves

to God, as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness
unto God.”1923 In these same members, therefore, in which we used to serve sin, and bring
forth fruit unto death, does He wish us to [be obedient] unto righteousness, that we may
bring forth fruit unto life. Remember, therefore, my beloved friend, that thou hast been redeemed
by the flesh of our Lord, re-established1924 by His blood; and “holding the Head,
from which the whole body of the Church, having been fitted together, takes increase”

<head>Chapter XV.—Proofs of the resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel; the same God
who created us will also raise us up.</head>
<p>1. Now, that He who at the beginning created man, did promise him a second birth
after his dissolution into earth, Esaias thus declares: “The dead shall rise again, and they
who are in the tombs shall arise, and they who are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew
which is from Thee is health to them.”1927 And again: “I will comfort you, and ye shall be
comforted in Jerusalem: and ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall
flourish as the grass; and the hand of the Lord shall be known to those who worship Him.”1928
And Ezekiel speaks as follows: “And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and the Lord led
me forth in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and this place was full of
bones. And He caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were many upon
the surface of the plain very dry. And He said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live?
And I said, Lord, Thou who hast made them dost know. And He said unto me, Prophesy
upon these bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus
saith the Lord to these bones, Behold, I will cause the spirit of life to come upon you, and I
will lay sinews upon you, and bring up flesh again upon you, and I will stretch skin upon
you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
And I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me. And it came to pass, when I was
prophesying, that, behold, an earthquake, and the bones were drawn together, each one to
its own articulation: and I beheld, and, lo, the sinews and flesh were produced upon them,
and the skins rose upon them round about, but there was no breath in them. And He said
unto me, Prophesy to the breath, son of man, and say to the breath, These things saith the
Lord, Come from the four winds (spiritibus), and breathe upon these dead, that they may
live. So I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me, and the breath entered into them;
and they did live, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great gathering.”1929 And again
he says, “Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will set your graves open, and cause you to come
out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the
Lord, when I shall open your sepulchres, that I may bring my people again out of the sepulchres:
and I will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and I will place you in your land,
and ye shall know that I am the Lord. I have said, and I will do, saith the Lord.”1930 As we
at once perceive that the Creator (Demiurgo) is in this passage represented as vivifying our
dead bodies, and promising resurrection to them, and resuscitation from their sepulchres
and tombs, conferring upon them immortality also (He says, “For as the tree of life, so shall

their days be”1931), He is shown to be the only God who accomplishes these things, and as
Himself the good Father, benevolently conferring life upon those who have not life from
themselves.</p>
<p>2. And for this reason did the Lord most plainly manifest Himself and the Father to His
disciples, lest, forsooth, they might seek after another God besides Him who formed man,
and who gave him the breath of life; and that men might not rise to such a pitch of madness
as to feign another Father above the Creator. And thus also He healed by a word all the
others who were in a weakly condition because of sin; to whom also He said, “Behold, thou
art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee:”1932 pointing out by this,
that, because of the sin of disobedience, infirmities have come upon men. To that man,
however, who had been blind from his birth, He gave sight, not by means of a word, but by
an outward action; doing this not without a purpose, or because it so happened, but that
He might show forth the hand of God, that which at the beginning had moulded man. And
therefore, when His disciples asked Him for what cause the man had been born blind,
whether for his own or his parents’ fault, He replied, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his
parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.”1933 Now the work of
God is the fashioning of man. For, as the Scripture says, He made [man] by a kind of process:
“And the Lord took clay from the earth, and formed man.”1934 Wherefore also the Lord
spat on the ground and made clay, and smeared it upon the eyes, pointing out the original
fashioning [of man], how it was effected, and manifesting the hand of God to those who
can understand by what [hand] man was formed out of the dust. For that which the artificer,
the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, [viz., the blind man’s eyes], He then supplied
in public, that the works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be
seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another Father; knowing that
this hand of God which formed us at the beginning, and which does form us in the womb,
has in the last times sought us out who were lost, winning back His own, and taking up the
lost sheep upon His shoulders, and with joy restoring it to the fold of life.</p>
<p>3. Now, that the Word of God forms us in the womb, He says to Jeremiah, “Before I
formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; and before thou wentest forth from the belly, I
sanctified thee, and appointed thee a prophet among the nations.”1935 And Paul, too, says
in like manner, “But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, that
I might declare Him among the nations.”1936 As, therefore, we are by the Word formed in

the womb, this very same Word formed the visual power in him who had been blind from
his birth; showing openly who it is that fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had
been made manifest to men: and declaring the original formation of Adam, and the manner
in which he was created, and by what hand he was fashioned, indicating the whole from a
part. For the Lord who formed the visual powers is He who made the whole man, carrying
out the will of the Father. And inasmuch as man, with respect to that formation which, was
after Adam, having fallen into transgression, needed the laver of regeneration, [the Lord]
said to him [upon whom He had conferred sight], after He had smeared his eyes with the
clay, “Go to Siloam, and wash;”1937 thus restoring to him both [his perfect] confirmation,
and that regeneration which takes place by means of the laver. And for this reason when he
was washed he came seeing, that he might both know Him who had fashioned him, and
that man might learn [to know] Him who has conferred upon him life.</p>
<p>4. All the followers of Valentinus, therefore, lose their case, when they say that man was
not fashioned out of this earth, but from a fluid and diffused substance. For, from the earth
out of which the Lord formed eyes for that man, from the same earth it is evident that man
was also fashioned at the beginning. For it were incompatible that the eyes should indeed
be formed from one source and the rest of the body from another; as neither would it be
compatible that one [being] fashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the very same
who formed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father spake, [saying], “Let Us
make man after Our image and likeness,”1938 revealing Himself in these last times to men,
formed visual organs (visionem) for him who had been blind [in that body which he had
derived] from Adam. Wherefore also the Scripture, pointing out what should come to pass,
says, that when Adam had hid himself because of his disobedience, the Lord came to him
at eventide, called him forth, and said, “Where art thou?”1939 That means that in the last
times the very same Word of God came to call man, reminding him of his doings, living in
which he had been hidden from the Lord. For just as at that time God spake to Adam at
eventide, searching him out; so in the last times, by means of the same voice, searching out
his posterity, He has visited them.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Since our bodies return to the earth, it follows that they have
their substance from it; also, by the advent of the Word, the image of God in us
appeared in a clearer light.</head>
<p>1. And since Adam was moulded from this earth to which we belong, the Scripture tells
us that God said to him, “In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat thy bread, until thou turnest
again to the dust from whence thou wert taken.”1940 If then, after death, our bodies return
to any other substance, it follows that from it also they have their substance. But if it be into
this very [earth], it is manifest that it was also from it that man’s frame was created; as also
the Lord clearly showed, when from this very substance He formed eyes for the man [to
whom He gave sight]. And thus was the hand of God plainly shown forth, by which Adam
was fashioned, and we too have been formed; and since there is one and the same Father,
whose voice from the beginning even to the end is present with His handiwork, and the
substance from which we were formed is plainly declared through the Gospel, we should
therefore not seek after another Father besides Him, nor [look for] another substance from
which we have been formed, besides what was mentioned beforehand, and shown forth by
the Lord; nor another hand of God besides that which, from the beginning even to the end,
forms us and prepares us for life, and is present with His handiwork, and perfects it after
the image and likeness of God.</p>
<p>2. And then, again, this Word was manifested when the Word of God was made man,
assimilating Himself to man, and man to Himself, so that by means of his resemblance to
the Son, man might become precious to the Father. For in times long past, it was said that
man was created after the image of God, but it was not [actually] shown; for the Word was
as yet invisible, after whose image man was created, Wherefore also he did easily lose the
similitude. When, however, the Word of God became flesh, He confirmed both these: for
He both showed forth the image truly, since He became Himself what was His image; and
He re-established the similitude after a sure manner, by assimilating man to the invisible
Father through means of the visible Word.</p>
<p>3. And not by the aforesaid things alone has the Lord manifested Himself, but [He has
done this] also by means of His passion. For doing away with [the effects of] that disobedience
of man which had taken place at the beginning by the occasion of a tree, “He became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross;”1941 rectifying that disobedience which
had occurred by reason of a tree, through that obedience which was [wrought out] upon
the tree [of the cross]. Now He would not have come to do away, by means of that same
[image], the disobedience which had been incurred towards our Maker if He proclaimed
another Father. But inasmuch as it was by these things that we disobeyed God, and did not

<pb n="1341"/>
give credit to His word, so was it also by these same that He brought in obedience and
consent as respects His Word; by which things He clearly shows forth God Himself, whom
indeed we had offended in the first Adam, when he did not perform His commandment.
In the second Adam, however, we are reconciled, being made obedient even unto death.
For we were debtors to none other but to Him whose commandment we had transgressed
at the beginning.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—There is but one Lord and one God, the Father and Creator of
all things, who has loved us in Christ, given us commandments, and remitted
our sins; whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be, when He forgave
our sins.</head>
<p>1. Now this being is the Creator (Demiurgus), who is, in respect of His love, the Father;
but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in respect of His wisdom, our Maker and
Fashioner; by transgressing whose commandment we became His enemies. And therefore
in the last times the Lord has restored us into friendship through His incarnation, having
become “the Mediator between God and men;”1942 propitiating indeed for us the Father
against whom we had sinned, and cancelling (consolatus) our disobedience by His own
obedience; conferring also upon us the gift of communion with, and subjection to, our
Maker. For this reason also He has taught us to say in prayer, “And forgive us our debts;”1943
since indeed He is our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed His commandments.
But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a Father who gives no com-
mandment to any one? Or is He the God who is proclaimed in the Scriptures, to whom we
were debtors, having transgressed His commandment? Now the commandment was given
to man by the Word. For Adam, it is said, “heard the voice of the Lord God.”1944 Rightly
then does His Word say to man, “Thy sins are forgiven thee;”1945 He, the same against
whom we had sinned in the beginning, grants forgiveness of sins in the end. But if indeed
we had disobeyed the command of any other, while it was a different being who said, “Thy
sins are forgiven thee;”1946 such an one is neither good, nor true, nor just. For how can he
be good, who does not give from what belongs to himself? Or how can he be just, who
snatches away the goods of another? And in what way can sins be truly remitted, unless that
He against whom we have sinned has Himself granted remission “through the bowels of
mercy of our God,” in which “He has visited us”1947 through His Son?</p>
<p>2. And therefore, when He had healed the man sick of the palsy, [the evangelist] says,
“The people upon seeing it glorified God, who gave such power unto men.”1948 What God,
then, did the bystanders glorify? Was it indeed that unknown Father invented by the heretics?
And how could they glorify him who was altogether unknown to them? It is evident,
therefore, that the Israelites glorified Him who has been proclaimed as God by the law and

the prophets, who is also the Father of our Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence
of their senses through those signs which He accomplished, to give glory to God. If,
however, He Himself had come from another Father, and men glorified a different Father
when they beheld His miracles, He [in that case] rendered them ungrateful to that Father
who had sent the gift of healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come for man’s salvation
from Him who is God, He did both stir up the incredulous by the miracles which He was
in the habit of working, to give glory to the Father; and to the Pharisees, who did not admit
the advent of His Son, and who consequently did not believe in the remission [of sins] which
was conferred by Him, He said, “That ye may know that the Son of man hath power to forgive
sins.”1949 And when He had said this, He commanded the paralytic man to take up the
pallet upon which he was lying, and go into his house. By this work of His He confounded
the unbelievers, and showed that He is Himself the voice of God, by which man received
commandments, which he broke, and became a sinner; for the paralysis followed as a consequence
of sins.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, by remitting sins, He did indeed heal man, while He also manifested
Himself who He was. For if no one can forgive sins but God alone, while the Lord remitted
them and healed men, it is plain that He was Himself the Word of God made the Son of
man, receiving from the Father the power of remission of sins; since He was man, and since
He was God, in order that since as man He suffered for us, so as God He might have compassion
on us, and forgive us our debts, in which we were made debtors to God our Creator.
And therefore David said beforehand, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin;”1950
pointing out thus that remission of sins which follows upon His advent, by which “He has
destroyed the handwriting” of our debt, and “fastened it to the cross;”1951 so that as by
means of a tree we were made debtors to God, [so also] by means of a tree we may obtain
the remission of our debt.</p>
<p>4. This fact has been strikingly set forth by many others, and especially through means
of Elisha the prophet. For when his fellow-prophets were hewing wood for the construction
of a tabernacle, and when the iron [head], shaken loose from the axe, had fallen into the
Jordan and could not be found by them, upon Elisha’s coming to the place, and learning
what had happened, he threw some wood into the water. Then, when he had done this, the
iron part of the axe floated up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they
had previously lost.1952 By this action the prophet pointed out that the sure word of God,

which we had negligently lost by means of a tree, and were not in the way of finding again,
we should receive anew by the dispensation of a tree, [viz., the cross of Christ]. For that the
word of God is likened to an axe, John the Baptist declares [when he says] in reference to
it, “But now also is the axe laid to the root of the trees.”1953 Jeremiah also says to the same
purport: “The word of God cleaveth the rock as an axe.”1954 This word, then, what was
hidden from us, did the dispensation of the tree make manifest, as I have already remarked.
For as we lost it by means of a tree, by means of a tree again was it made manifest to all,
showing the height, the length, the breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among
our predecessors observed, “Through the extension of the hands of a divine person,1955
gathering together the two peoples to one God.” For these were two hands, because there
were two peoples scattered to the ends of the earth; but there was one head in the middle,
as there is but one God, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—God the Father and His Word have formed all created things
(which They use) by Their own power and wisdom, not out of defect or ignorance.
The Son of God, who received all power from the Father, would otherwise never
have taken flesh upon Him.</head>
<p>1. And such or so important a dispensation He did not bring about by means of the
creations of others, but by His own; neither by those things which were created out of ignorance
and defect, but by those which had their substance from the wisdom and power of His
Father. For He was neither unrighteous, so that He should covet the property of another;
nor needy, that He could not by His own means impart life to His own, and make use of
His own creation for the salvation of man. For indeed the creation could not have sustained
Him [on the cross], if He had sent forth [simply by commission] what was the fruit of ignorance
and defect. Now we have repeatedly shown that the incarnate Word of God was suspended
upon a tree, and even the very heretics do acknowledge that He was crucified. How,
then, could the fruit of ignorance and defect sustain Him who contains the knowledge of
all things, and is true and perfect? Or how could that creation which was concealed from
the Father, and far removed from Him, have sustained His Word? And if this world were
made by the angels (it matters not whether we suppose their ignorance or their cognizance
of the Supreme God), when the Lord declared, “For I am in the Father, and the Father in
Me,”1956 how could this workmanship of the angels have borne to be burdened at once with
the Father and the Son? How, again, could that creation which is beyond the Pleroma have
contained Him who contains the entire Pleroma? Inasmuch, then, as all these things are
impossible and incapable of proof, that preaching of the Church is alone true [which proclaims]
that His own creation bare Him, which subsists by the power, the skill, and the
wisdom of God; which is sustained, indeed, after an invisible manner by the Father, but, on
the contrary, after a visible manner it bore His Word: and this is the true [Word].</p>
<p>2. For the Father bears the creation and His own Word simultaneously, and the Word
borne by the Father grants the Spirit to all as the Father wills.1957 To some He gives after
the manner of creation what is made;1958 but to others [He gives] after the manner of adoption,
that is, what is from God, namely generation. And thus one God the Father is declared,
who is above all, and through all, and in all. The Father is indeed above all, and He is the

Head of Christ; but the Word is through all things, and is Himself the Head of the Church;
while the Spirit is in us all, and He is the living water,1959 which the Lord grants to those
who rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who know that “there is one Father, who is
above all, and through all, and in us all.”1960 And to these things does John also, the disciple
of the Lord, bear witness, when he speaks thus in the Gospel: “In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with
God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.”1961 And then he
said of the Word Himself: “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the
world knew Him not. To His own things He came, and His own people received Him not.
However, as many as did receive Him, to these gave He power to become the sons of God,
to those that believe in His name.”1962 And again, showing the dispensation with regard to
His human nature, John said: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”1963
And in continuation he says, “And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten
by the Father, full of grace and truth.” He thus plainly points out to those willing to hear,
that is, to those having ears, that there is one God, the Father over all, and one Word of God,
who is through all, by whom all things have been made; and that this world belongs to Him,
and was made by Him, according to the Father’s will, and not by angels; nor by apostasy,
defect, and ignorance; nor by any power of Prunicus, whom certain of them also call “the
Mother;” nor by any other maker of the world ignorant of the Father.</p>
<p>3. For the Creator of the world is truly the Word of God: and this is our Lord, who in
the last times was made man, existing in this world, and who in an invisible manner contains
all things created, and is inherent in the entire creation, since the Word of God governs and
arranges all things; and therefore He came to His own in a visible1964 manner, and was
made flesh, and hung upon the tree, that He might sum up all things in Himself. “And His
own peculiar people did not receive Him,” as Moses declared this very thing among the
people: “And thy life shall be hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy life.”1965
Those therefore who did not receive Him did not receive life. “But to as many as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.”1966 For it is He who has power
from the Father over all things, since He is the Word of God, and very man, communicating

had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication, receive the glad
tidings that she should sustain (portaret) God, being obedient to His word. And if the former
did disobey God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God, in order that the Virgin
Mary might become the patroness1969 (advocata) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human
race fell into bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal
disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal obedience. For in the
same way the sin of the first created man (protoplasti) receives amendment by the correction
of the First-begotten, and the coming of the serpent is conquered by the harmlessness of
the dove, those bonds being unloosed by which we had been fast bound to death.</p>
<p>2. The heretics being all unlearned and ignorant of God’s arrangements, and not acquainted
with that dispensation by which He took upon Him human nature (inscii ejus quæ est
secundum hominem dispensationis), inasmuch as they blind themselves with regard to the
truth, do in fact speak against their own salvation. Some of them introduce another Father
besides the Creator; some, again, say that the world and its substance was made by certain
angels; certain others [maintain] that it was widely separated by Horos1970 from him whom
they represent as being the Father—that it sprang forth (floruisse) of itself, and from itself
was born. Then, again, others [of them assert] that it obtained substance in those things
which are contained by the Father, from defect and ignorance; others still, despise the advent
of the Lord manifest [to the senses], for they do not admit His incarnation; while others,
ignoring the arrangement [that He should be born] of a virgin, maintain that He was begotten

<head>Chapter XX.—Those pastors are to be heard to whom the apostles committed
the Churches, possessing one and the same doctrine of salvation; the heretics,
on the other hand, are to be avoided. We must think soberly with regard to the
mysteries of the faith.</head>
<p>1. Now all these [heretics] are of much later date than the bishops to whom the apostles
committed the Churches; which fact I have in the third book taken all pains to demonstrate.
It follows, then, as a matter of course, that these heretics aforementioned, since they are
blind to the truth, and deviate from the [right] way, will walk in various roads; and therefore
the footsteps of their doctrine are scattered here and there without agreement or connection.
But the path of those belonging to the Church circumscribes the whole world, as possessing
the sure tradition from the apostles, and gives unto us to see that the faith of all is one and
the same, since all receive one and the same God the Father, and believe in the same dispensation
regarding the incarnation of the Son of God, and are cognizant of the same gift of the
Spirit, and are conversant with the same commandments, and preserve the same form of
ecclesiastical constitution,1971 and expect the same advent of the Lord, and await the same
salvation of the complete man, that is, of the soul and body. And undoubtedly the preaching
of the Church is true and stedfast,1972 in which one and the same way of salvation is shown
throughout the whole world. For to her is entrusted the light of God; and therefore the
“wisdom” of God, by means of which she saves all men, “is declared in [its] going forth; it
uttereth [its voice] faithfully in the streets, is preached on the tops of the walls, and speaks
continually in the gates of the city.”1973 For the Church preaches the truth everywhere, and
she is the seven-branched candlestick which bears the light of Christ.</p>
<p>2. Those, therefore, who desert the preaching of the Church, call in question the
knowledge of the holy presbyters, not taking into consideration of how much greater consequence
is a religious man, even in a private station, than a blasphemous and impudent
sophist.1974 Now, such are all the heretics, and those who imagine that they have hit upon
something more beyond the truth, so that by following those things already mentioned,
proceeding on their way variously, inharmoniously, and foolishly, not keeping always to
the same opinions with regard to the same things, as blind men are led by the blind, they
shall deservedly fall into the ditch of ignorance lying in their path, ever seeking and never
finding out the truth.1975 It behoves us, therefore, to avoid their doctrines, and to take

careful heed lest we suffer any injury from them; but to flee to the Church, and be brought
up in her bosom, and be nourished with the Lord’s Scriptures. For the Church has been
planted as a garden (paradisus) in this world; therefore says the Spirit of God, “Thou mayest
freely eat from every tree of the garden,”1976 that is, Eat ye from every Scripture of the Lord;
but ye shall not eat with an uplifted mind, nor touch any heretical discord. For these men
do profess that they have themselves the knowledge of good and evil; and they set their own
impious minds above the God who made them. They therefore form opinions on what is
beyond the limits of the understanding. For this cause also the apostle says, “Be not wise
beyond what it is fitting to be wise, but be wise prudently,”1977 that we be not cast forth by
eating of the “knowledge” of these men (that knowledge which knows more than it should
do) from the paradise of life. Into this paradise the Lord has introduced those who obey His
call, “summing up in Himself all things which are in heaven, and which are on earth;”1978
but the things in heaven are spiritual, while those on earth constitute the dispensation in
human nature (secundum hominem est dispositio). These things, therefore, He recapitulated
in Himself: by uniting man to the Spirit, and causing the Spirit to dwell in man, He is
Himself made the head of the Spirit, and gives the Spirit to be the head of man: for through
Him (the Spirit) we see, and hear, and speak.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Christ is the head of all things already mentioned. It was fitting
that He should be sent by the Father, the Creator of all things, to assume human
nature, and should be tempted by Satan, that He might fulfil the promises, and
carry off a glorious and perfect victory.</head>
<p>1. He has therefore, in His work of recapitulation, summed up all things, both waging
war against our enemy, and crushing him who had at the beginning led us away captives in
Adam, and trampled upon his head, as thou canst perceive in Genesis that God said to the
serpent, “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and
her seed; He shall be on the watch for (observabit1979) thy head, and thou on the watch for
His heel.”1980 For from that time, He who should be born of a woman, [namely] from the
Virgin, after the likeness of Adam, was preached as keeping watch for the head of the serpent.
This is the seed of which the apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians, “that the law of
works was established until the seed should come to whom the promise was made.”1981
This fact is exhibited in a still clearer light in the same Epistle, where he thus speaks: “But
when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman.”1982 For
indeed the enemy would not have been fairly vanquished, unless it had been a man [born]
of a woman who conquered him. For it was by means of a woman that he got the advantage
over man at first, setting himself up as man’s opponent. And therefore does the Lord profess
Himself to be the Son of man, comprising in Himself that original man out of whom the
woman was fashioned (ex quo ea quæ secundum mulierem est plasmatio facta est), in order
that, as our species went down to death through a vanquished man, so we may ascend to
life again through a victorious one; and as through a man death received the palm [of victory]
against us, so again by a man we may receive the palm against death.</p>
<p>2. Now the Lord would not have recapitulated in Himself that ancient and primary
enmity against the serpent, fulfilling the promise of the Creator (Demiurgi), and performing
His command, if He had come from another Father. But as He is one and the same, who
formed us at the beginning, and sent His Son at the end, the Lord did perform His command,
being made of a woman, by both destroying our adversary, and perfecting man after the
image and likeness of God. And for this reason He did not draw the means of confounding
him from any other source than from the words of the law, and made use of the Father’s
commandment as a help towards the destruction and confusion of the apostate angel.
Fasting forty days, like Moses and Elias, He afterwards hungered, first, in order that we may
perceive that He was a real and substantial man—for it belongs to a man to suffer hunger

when fasting; and secondly, that His opponent might have an opportunity of attacking Him.
For as at the beginning it was by means of food that [the enemy] persuaded man, although
not suffering hunger, to transgress God’s commandments, so in the end he did not succeed
in persuading Him that was an hungered to take that food which proceeded from God. For,
when tempting Him, he said, “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be
made bread.”1983 But the Lord repulsed him by the commandment of the law, saying, “It
is written, Man doth not live by bread alone.”1984 As to those words [of His enemy,] “If
thou be the Son of God,” [the Lord] made no remark; but by thus acknowledging His human
nature He baffled His adversary, and exhausted the force of his first attack by means of His
Father’s word. The corruption of man, therefore, which occurred in paradise by both [of
our first parents] eating, was done away with by [the Lord’s] want of food in this world.1985
But he, being thus vanquished by the law, endeavoured again to make an assault by himself
quoting a commandment of the law. For, bringing Him to the highest pinnacle of the temple,
he said to Him, “If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down. For it is written, That God
shall give His angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest
perchance thou dash thy foot against a stone;”1986 thus concealing a falsehood under the
guise of Scripture, as is done by all the heretics. For that was indeed written, [namely], “That
He hath given His angels charge concerning Him;” but “cast thyself down from hence” no
Scripture said in reference to Him: this kind of persuasion the devil produced from himself.
The Lord therefore confuted him out of the law, when He said, “It is written again, Thou
shalt not tempt the Lord thy God;”1987 pointing out by the word contained in the law that
which is the duty of man, that he should not tempt God; and in regard to Himself, since He
appeared in human form, [declaring] that He would not tempt the Lord his God.1988 The
pride of reason, therefore, which was in the serpent, was put to nought by the humility found
in the man [Christ], and now twice was the devil conquered from Scripture, when he was
detected as advising things contrary to God’s commandment, and was shown to be the enemy
of God by [the expression of] his thoughts. He then, having been thus signally defeated, and
then, as it were, concentrating his forces, drawing up in order all his available power for
falsehood, in the third place “showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of

them,”1989 saying, as Luke relates, “All these will I give thee,—for they are delivered to me;
and to whom I will, I give them,—if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” The Lord then,
exposing him in his true character, says, “Depart, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”1990 He both revealed him by this name,
and showed [at the same time] who He Himself was. For the Hebrew word “Satan” signifies
an apostate. And thus, vanquishing him for the third time, He spurned him from Him finally
as being conquered out of the law; and there was done away with that infringement of God’s
commandment which had occurred in Adam, by means of the precept of the law, which
the Son of man observed, who did not transgress the commandment of God.</p>
<p>3. Who, then, is this Lord God to whom Christ bears witness, whom no man shall tempt,
whom all should worship, and serve Him alone? It is, beyond all manner of doubt, that God
who also gave the law. For these things had been predicted in the law, and by the words
(sententiam) of the law the Lord showed that the law does indeed declare the Word of God
from the Father; and the apostate angel of God is destroyed by its voice, being exposed in
his true colours, and vanquished by the Son of man keeping the commandment of God. For
as in the beginning he enticed man to transgress his Maker’s law, and thereby got him into
his power; yet his power consists in transgression and apostasy, and with these he bound
man [to himself]; so again, on the other hand, it was necessary that through man himself
he should, when conquered, be bound with the same chains with which he had bound man,
in order that man, being set free, might return to his Lord, leaving to him (Satan) those
bonds by which he himself had been fettered, that is, sin. For when Satan is bound, man is
set free; since “none can enter a strong man’s house and spoil his goods, unless he first bind
the strong man himself.”1991 The Lord therefore exposes him as speaking contrary to the
word of that God who made all things, and subdues him by means of the commandment.
Now the law is the commandment of God. The Man proves him to be a fugitive from and
a transgressor of the law, an apostate also from God. After [the Man had done this], the
Word bound him securely as a fugitive from Himself, and made spoil of his goods,— namely,
those men whom he held in bondage, and whom he unjustly used for his own purposes.
And justly indeed is he led captive, who had led men unjustly into bondage; while man, who
had been led captive in times past, was rescued from the grasp of his possessor, according
to the tender mercy of God the Father, who had compassion on His own handiwork, and
gave to it salvation, restoring it by means of the Word—that is, by Christ—in order that
man might learn by actual proof that he receives incorruptibility not of himself, but by the
free gift of God.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The true Lord and the one God is declared by the law, and
manifested by Christ His Son in the Gospel; whom alone we should adore, and
from Him we must look for all good things, not from Satan.</head>
<p>1. Thus then does the Lord plainly show that it was the true Lord and the one God who
had been set forth by the law; for Him whom the law proclaimed as God, the same did Christ
point out as the Father, whom also it behoves the disciples of Christ alone to serve. By means
of the statements of the law, He put our adversary to utter confusion; and the law directs
us to praise God the Creator (Demiurgum), and to serve Him alone. Since this is the case,
we must not seek for another Father besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God
who justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.1992 For if
there were any other perfect Father above Him, He (Christ) would by no means have overthrown
Satan by means of His words and commandments. For one ignorance cannot be
done away with by means of another ignorance, any more than one defect by another defect.
If, therefore, the law is due to ignorance and defect, how could the statements contained
therein bring to nought the ignorance of the devil, and conquer the strong man? For a strong
man can be conquered neither by an inferior nor by an equal, but by one possessed of
greater power. But the Word of God is the superior above all, He who is loudly proclaimed
in the law: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God;” and, “Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart;” and, “Him shall thou adore, and Him alone shall thou serve.”1993
Then in the Gospel, casting down the apostasy by means of these expressions, He did both
overcome the strong man by His Father’s voice, and He acknowledges the commandment
of the law to express His own sentiments, when He says, “Thou shall not tempt the Lord
thy God.”1994 For He did not confound the adversary by the saying of any other, but by that
belonging to His own Father, and thus overcame the strong man.</p>
<p>2. He taught by His commandment that we who have been set free should, when hungry,
take that food which is given by God; and that, when placed in the exalted position of every
grace [that can be received], we should not, either by trusting to works of righteousness, or
when adorned with super-eminent [gifts of] ministration, by any means be lifted up with
pride, nor should we tempt God, but should feel humility in all things, and have ready to
hand [this saying], “Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.”1995 As also the apostle taught,
saying, “Minding not high things, but consenting to things of low estate;”1996 that we should
neither be ensnared with riches, nor mundane glory, nor present fancy, but should know

that we must “worship the Lord thy God, and serve Him alone,” and give no heed to him
who falsely promised things not his own, when he said, “All these will I give thee, if, falling
down, thou wilt worship me.” For he himself confesses that to adore him, and to do his will,
is to fall from the glory of God. And in what thing either pleasant or good can that man who
has fallen participate? Or what else can such a person hope for or expect, except death? For
death is next neighbour to him who has fallen. Hence also it follows that he will not give
what he has promised. For how can he make grants to him who has fallen? Moreover, since
God rules over men and him too, and without the will of our Father in heaven not even a
sparrow falls to the ground,1997 it follows that his declaration, “All these things are delivered
unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give them,” proceeds from him when puffed up with
pride. For the creation is not subjected to his power, since indeed he is himself but one
among created things. Nor shall he give away the rule over men to men; but both all other
things, and all human affairs, are arranged according to God the Father’s disposal. Besides,
the Lord declares that “the devil is a liar from the beginning, and the truth is not in him.”1998
If then he be a liar and the truth be not in him, he certainly did not speak truth, but a lie,
when he said, “For all these things are delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will I give
them.”1999</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The devil is well practised in falsehood, by which Adam having
been led astray, sinned on the sixth day of the creation, in which day also he has
been renewed by Christ.</head>
<p>1. He had indeed been already accustomed to lie against God, for the purpose of leading
men astray. For at the beginning, when God had given to man a variety of things for food,
while He commanded him not to eat of one tree only, as the Scripture tells us that God said
to Adam: “From every tree which is in the garden thou shalt eat food; but from the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, from this ye shall not eat: for in the day that ye shall eat of it,
ye shall die by death;”2000 he then, lying against the Lord, tempted man, as the Scripture
says that the serpent said to the woman: “Has God indeed said this, Ye shall not eat from
every tree of the garden?”2001 And when she had exposed the falsehood, and simply related
the command, as He had said, “From every tree of the garden we shall eat; but of the fruit
of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
shall ye touch it, lest ye die:”2002 when he had [thus] learned from the woman the command
of God, having brought his cunning into play, he finally deceived her by a falsehood, saying,
“Ye shall not die by death; for God knew that in the day ye shall eat of it your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”2003 In the first place, then, in the
garden of God he disputed about God, as if God was not there, for he was ignorant of the
greatness of God; and then, in the next place, after he had learned from the woman that
God had said that they should die if they tasted the aforesaid tree, opening his mouth, he
uttered the third falsehood, “Ye shall not die by death.” But that God was true, and the serpent
a liar, was proved by the result, death having passed upon them who had eaten. For along
with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience;
and disobedience to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from
that [moment] they were handed over to it.</p>
<p>2. Thus, then, in the day that they did eat, in the same did they die, and became death’s
debtors, since it was one day of the creation. For it is said, “There was made in the evening,
and there was made in the morning, one day.” Now in this same day that they did eat, in
that also did they die. But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after which one
is termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon
what day out of the seven it was that Adam died, he will find it by examining the dispensation
of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole human race from the beginning to
the end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the Lord suffered death,

<pb n="1358"/>
in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which Adam died while he disobeyed God.
Now he died on the same day in which he did eat. For God said, “In that day on which ye
shall eat of it, ye shall die by death.” The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day,
underwent His sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, the sixth day of the
creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a second creation by means of
His passion, which is that [creation] out of death. And there are some, again, who relegate
the death of Adam to the thousandth year; for since “a day of the Lord is as a thousand
years,”2004 he did not overstep the thousand years, but died within them, thus bearing out
the sentence of his sin. Whether, therefore, with respect to disobedience, which is death;
whether [we consider] that, on account of that, they were delivered over to death, and made
debtors to it; whether with respect to [the fact that on] one and the same day on which they
ate they also died (for it is one day of the creation); whether [we regard this point], that,
with respect to this cycle of days, they died on the day in which they did also eat, that is, the
day of the preparation, which is termed “the pure supper,” that is, the sixth day of the feast,
which the Lord also exhibited when He suffered on that day; or whether [we reflect] that
he (Adam) did not overstep the thousand years, but died within their limit,—it follows that,
in regard to all these significations, God is indeed true. For they died who tasted of the tree;
and the serpent is proved a liar and a murderer, as the Lord said of him: “For he is a murderer
from the beginning, and the truth is not in him.”2005</p>

governments of the world, which we ought to obey, inasmuch as they are
appointed of God, not of the devil.</head>
<p>1. As therefore the devil lied at the beginning, so did he also in the end, when he said,
“All these are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give them.”2006 For it is not he
who has appointed the kingdoms of this world, but God; for “the heart of the king is in the
hand of God.”2007 And the Word also says by Solomon, “By me kings do reign, and princes
administer justice. By me chiefs are raised up, and by me kings rule the earth.”2008 Paul the
apostle also says upon this same subject: “Be ye subject to all the higher powers; for there is
no power but of God: now those which are have been ordained of God.”2009 And again, in
reference to them he says, “For he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of
God, the avenger for wrath to him who does evil.”2010 Now, that he spake these words, not
in regard to angelical powers, nor of invisible rulers— as some venture to expound the
passage—but of those of actual human authorities, [he shows when] he says, “For this cause
pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, doing service for this very thing.”2011 This
also the Lord confirmed, when He did not do what He was tempted to by the devil; but He
gave directions that tribute should be paid to the tax-gatherers for Himself and Peter;2012
because “they are the ministers of God, serving for this very thing.”</p>
<p>2. For since man, by departing from God, reached such a pitch of fury as even to look
upon his brother as his enemy, and engaged without fear in every kind of restless conduct,
and murder, and avarice; God imposed upon mankind the fear of man, as they did not acknowledge
the fear of God, in order that, being subjected to the authority of men, and kept
under restraint by their laws, they might attain to some degree of justice, and exercise mutual
forbearance through dread of the sword suspended full in their view, as the apostle says:
“For he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath
upon him who does evil.” And for this reason too, magistrates themselves, having laws as
a clothing of righteousness whenever they act in a just and legitimate manner, shall not be
called in question for their conduct, nor be liable to punishment. But whatsoever they do
to the subversion of justice, iniquitously, and impiously, and illegally, and tyrannically, in
these things shall they also perish; for the just judgment of God comes equally upon all, and

Chapter XXIV.—Of the constant falsehood of the devil, and of the powers…
in no case is defective. Earthly rule, therefore, has been appointed by God for the benefit of
nations,2013 and not by the devil, who is never at rest at all, nay, who does not love to see
even nations conducting themselves after a quiet manner, so that under the fear of human
rule, men may not eat each other up like fishes; but that, by means of the establishment of
laws, they may keep down an excess of wickedness among the nations. And considered from
this point of view, those who exact tribute from us are “God’s ministers, serving for this
very purpose.”</p>
<p>3. As, then, “the powers that be are ordained of God,” it is clear that the devil lied when
he said, “These are delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give them.” For by the
law of the same Being as calls men into existence are kings also appointed, adapted for those
men who are at the time placed under their government. Some of these [rulers] are given
for the correction and the benefit of their subjects, and for the preservation of justice; but
others, for the purposes of fear and punishment and rebuke: others, as [the subjects] deserve
it, are for deception, disgrace, and pride; while the just judgment of God, as I have observed
already, passes equally upon all. The devil, however, as he is the apostate angel, can only go
to this length, as he did at the beginning, [namely] to deceive and lead astray the mind of
man into disobeying the commandments of God, and gradually to darken the hearts of
those who would endeavour to serve him, to the forgetting of the true God, but to the adoration
of himself as God.</p>
<p>4. Just as if any one, being an apostate, and seizing in a hostile manner another man’s
territory, should harass the inhabitants of it, in order that he might claim for himself the
glory of a king among those ignorant of his apostasy and robbery; so likewise also the devil,
being one among those angels who are placed over the spirit of the air, as the Apostle Paul
has declared in his Epistle to the Ephesians,2014 becoming envious of man, was rendered
an apostate from the divine law: for envy is a thing foreign to God. And as his apostasy was
exposed by man, and man became the [means of] searching out his thoughts (et examinatio
sententiæ ejus, homo factus est), he has set himself to this with greater and greater determination,
in opposition to man, envying his life, and wishing to involve him in his own apostate
power. The Word of God, however, the Maker of all things, conquering him by means of
human nature, and showing him to be an apostate, has, on the contrary, put him under the
power of man. For He says, “Behold, I confer upon you the power of treading upon serpents
and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy,”2015 in order that, as he obtained

<head>Chapter XXV.—The fraud, pride, and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist, as
described by Daniel and Paul.</head>
<p>1. And not only by the particulars already mentioned, but also by means of the events
which shall occur in the time of Antichrist is it shown that he, being an apostate and a robber,
is anxious to be adored as God; and that, although a mere slave, he wishes himself to be
proclaimed as a king. For he (Antichrist) being endued with all the power of the devil, shall
come, not as a righteous king, nor as a legitimate king, [i.e., one] in subjection to God, but
an impious, unjust, and lawless one; as an apostate, iniquitous and murderous; as a robber,
concentrating in himself [all] satanic apostasy, and setting aside idols to persuade [men]
that he himself is God, raising up himself as the only idol, having in himself the multifarious
errors of the other idols. This he does, in order that they who do [now] worship the devil
by means of many abominations, may serve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle
thus speaks in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians: “Unless there shall come a failing
away first, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the
temple of God, showing himself as if he were God.” The apostle therefore clearly points out
his apostasy, and that he is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped—that
is, above every idol —for these are indeed so called by men, but are not [really] gods; and
that he will endeavour in a tyrannical manner to set himself forth as God.</p>
<p>2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this which I have shown in many
ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by the direction of the true God. For the apostle
himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly called it the temple of God. Now I have shown
in the third book, that no one is termed God by the apostles when speaking for themselves,
except Him who truly is God, the Father of our Lord, by whose directions the temple which
is at Jerusalem was constructed for those purposes which I have already mentioned; in which
[temple] the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as Christ, as the Lord also declares:
“But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel
the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand), then let those who
are in Judea flee into the mountains; and he who is upon the house-top, let him not come
down to take anything out of his house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has
not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.”2016</p>
<p>3. Daniel too, looking forward to the end of the last kingdom, i.e., the ten last kings,
amongst whom the kingdom of those men shall be partitioned, and upon whom the son of
perdition shall come, declares that ten horns shall spring from the beast, and that another
little horn shall arise in the midst of them, and that three of the former shall be rooted up
before his face. He says: “And, behold, eyes were in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a
<note type="footnote">2016 Matt. xxiv. 15, 21.</note>

<pb n="1363"/>
mouth speaking great things, and his look was more stout than his fellows. I was looking,
and this horn made war against the saints, and prevailed against them, until the Ancient of
days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most high God, and the time came, and
the saints obtained the kingdom.”2017 Then, further on, in the interpretation of the vision,
there was said to him: “The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which
shall excel all other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and cut it in
pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise; and after them shall arise another,
who shall surpass in evil deeds all that were before him, and shall overthrow three kings;
and he shall speak words against the most high God, and wear out the saints of the most
high God, and shall purpose to change times and laws; and [everything] shall be given into
his hand until a time of times and a half time,”2018 that is, for three years and six months,
during which time, when he comes, he shall reign over the earth. Of whom also the Apostle
Paul again, speaking in the second [Epistle] to the Thessalonians, and at the same time
proclaiming the cause of his advent, thus says: “And then shall the wicked one be revealed,
whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy by the presence of
His coming; whose coming [i.e., the wicked one’s] is after the working of Satan, in all power,
and signs, and portents of lies, and with all deceivableness of wickedness for those who
perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And
therefore God will send them the working of error, that they may believe a lie; that they all
may be judged who did not believe the truth, but gave consent to iniquity,”2019</p>
<p>4. The Lord also spoke as follows to those who did not believe in Him: “I have come in
my Father’s name, and ye have not received Me: when another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive,”2020 calling Antichrist “the other,” because he is alienated from the
Lord. This is also the unjust judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one “who feared not God,
neither regarded man,”2021 to whom the widow fled in her forgetfulness of God,—that is,
the earthly Jerusalem,—to be avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the time
of his kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that [city], and shall sit in the temple of
God, leading astray those who worship him, as if he were Christ. To this purpose Daniel
says again: “And he shall desolate the holy place; and sin has been given for a sacrifice,2022

upon) the sacrifice.</note>

<pb n="1364"/>
and righteousness been cast away in the earth, and he has been active (fecit), and gone on
prosperously.”2023 And the angel Gabriel, when explaining his vision, states with regard to
this person: “And towards the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce countenance
shall arise, one understanding [dark] questions, and exceedingly powerful, full of wonders;
and he shall corrupt, direct, influence (faciet), and put strong men down, the holy people
likewise; and his yoke shall be directed as a wreath [round their neck]; deceit shall be in his
hand, and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall also ruin many by deceit, and lead many
to perdition, bruising them in his hand like eggs.”2024 And then he points out the time that
his tyranny shall last, during which the saints shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure
sacrifice unto God: “And in the midst of the week,” he says, “the sacrifice and the libation
shall be taken away, and the abomination of desolation [shall be brought] into the temple:
even unto the consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete.”2025 Now three
years and six months constitute the half-week.</p>
<p>5. From all these passages are revealed to us, not merely the particulars of the apostasy,
and [the doings] of him who concentrates in himself every satanic error, but also, that there
is one and the same God the Father, who was declared by the prophets, but made manifest
by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied concerning the end has been confirmed by the
Lord, when He said, “When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been
spoken of by Daniel the prophet”2026 (and the angel Gabriel gave the interpretation of the
visions to Daniel, and he is the archangel of the Creator (Demiurgi), who also proclaimed
to Mary the visible coming and the incarnation of Christ), then one and the same God is
most manifestly pointed out, who sent the prophets, and made promise2027 of the Son, and
called us into His knowledge.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—John and Daniel have predicted the dissolution and desolation
of the Roman Empire, which shall precede the end of the world and the eternal
kingdom of Christ. The Gnostics are refuted, those tools of Satan, who invent
another Father different from the Creator.</head>
<p>1. In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to the Lord’s disciples
what shall happen in the last times, and concerning the ten kings who shall then arise, among
whom the empire which now rules [the earth] shall be partitioned. He teaches us what the
ten horns shall be which were seen by Daniel, telling us that thus it had been said to him:
“And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet,
but shall receive power as if kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and give
their strength and power to the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb
shall overcome them, because He is the Lord of lords and the King of kings.”2028 It is
manifest, therefore, that of these [potentates], he who is to come shall slay three, and subject
the remainder to his power, and that he shall be himself the eighth among them. And they
shall lay Babylon waste, and burn her with fire, and shall give their kingdom to the beast,
and put the Church to flight. After that they shall be destroyed by the coming of our Lord.
For that the kingdom must be divided, and thus come to ruin, the Lord [declares when He]
says: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house
divided against itself shall not stand.”2029 It must be, therefore, that the kingdom, the city,
and the house be divided into ten; and for this reason He has already foreshadowed the
partition and division [which shall take place]. Daniel also says particularly, that the end of
the fourth kingdom consists in the toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, upon which
came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: “The feet were indeed
the one part iron, the other part clay, until the stone was cut out without hands, and struck
the image upon the iron and clay feet, and dashed them into pieces, even to the end.”2030
Then afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: “And as thou sawest the feet and the toes,
partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, and there shall be in
it a root of iron, as thou sawest iron mixed with baked clay. And the toes were indeed the
one part iron, but the other part clay.”2031 The ten toes, therefore, are these ten kings, among
whom the kingdom shall be partitioned, of whom some indeed shall be strong and active,
or energetic; others, again, shall be sluggish and useless, and shall not agree; as also Daniel
says: “Some part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be broken from it. As thou
sawest the iron mixed with the baked clay, there shall be minglings among the human race,
<note type="footnote">2028 Rev. xvii. 12, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">2029 Matt. xii. 25.</note>

<note type="footnote">2031 Dan. ii. 41, 42.</note>

<pb n="1366"/>
but no cohesion one with the other, just as iron cannot be welded on to pottery ware.”2032
And since an end shall take place, he says: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of
heaven raise up a kingdom which shall never decay, and His kingdom shall not be left to
another people. It shall break in pieces and shatter all kingdoms, and shall itself be exalted
for ever. As thou sawest that the stone was cut without hands from the mountain, and brake
in pieces the baked clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold, God has pointed out to
the king what shall come to pass after these things; and the dream is true, and the interpretation
trustworthy.”2033</p>
<p>2. If therefore the great God showed future things by Daniel, and confirmed them by
His Son; and if Christ is the stone which is cut out without hands, who shall destroy temporal
kingdoms, and introduce an eternal one, which is the resurrection of the just; as he declares,
“The God of heaven shall raise up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed,”—let those
thus confuted come to their senses, who reject the Creator (Demiurgum), and do not agree
that the prophets were sent beforehand from the same Father from whom also the Lord
came, but who assert that prophecies originated from diverse powers. For those things which
have been predicted by the Creator alike through all the prophets has Christ fulfilled in the
end, ministering to His Father’s will, and completing His dispensations with regard to the
human race. Let those persons, therefore, who blaspheme the Creator, either by openly expressed
words, such as the disciples of Marcion, or by a perversion of the sense [of Scripture],
as those of Valentinus and all the Gnostics falsely so called, be recognised as agents of Satan
by all those who worship God; through whose agency Satan now, and not before, has been
seen to speak against God, even Him who has prepared eternal fire for every kind of apostasy.
For he did not venture to blaspheme his Lord openly of himself; as also in the beginning he
led man astray through the instrumentality of the serpent, concealing himself as it were
from God. Truly has Justin remarked:2034 That before the Lord’s appearance Satan never
dared to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he did not yet know his own sentence, because it was
contained in parables and allegories; but that after the Lord’s appearance, when he had
clearly ascertained from the words of Christ and His apostles that eternal fire has been prepared
for him as he apostatized from God of his own free-will, and likewise for all who unrepentant
continue in the apostasy, he now blasphemes, by means of such men, the Lord
who brings judgment [upon him] as being already condemned, and imputes the guilt of his
apostasy to his Maker, not to his own voluntary disposition. Just as it is with those who
break the laws, when punishment overtakes them: they throw the blame upon those who

<head>Chapter XXVII.—The future judgment by Christ. Communion with and
separation from the divine being. The eternal punishment of unbelievers.</head>
<p>1. If the Father, then, does not exercise judgment, [it follows] that judgment does not
belong to Him, or that He consents to all those actions which take place; and if He does not
judge, all persons will be equal, and accounted in the same condition. The advent of Christ
will therefore be without an object, yea, absurd, inasmuch as [in that case] He exercises no
judicial power. For “He came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against
the mother, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law;”2035 and when two are in
one bed, to take the one, and to leave the other; and of two women grinding at the mill, to
take one and leave the other:2036 [also] at the time of the end, to order the reapers to collect
first the tares together, and bind them in bundles, and burn them with unquenchable fire,
but to gather up the wheat into the barn;2037 and to call the lambs into the kingdom prepared
for them, but to send the goats into everlasting fire, which has been prepared by His Father
for the devil and his angels.2038 And why is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and for
the resurrection of many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do not believe Him, to whom
also He has threatened a greater damnation in the judgment-day than that of Sodom and
Gomorrah;2039 but for the resurrection of believers, and those who do the will of His Father
in heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to all, but is for the purpose of
judging, and separating the believing from the unbelieving, since, as those who believe do
His will agreeably to their own choice, and as, [also] agreeably to their own choice, the disobedient
do not consent to His doctrine; it is manifest that His Father has made all in a like
condition, each person having a choice of his own, and a free understanding; and that He
has regard to all things, and exercises a providence over all, “making His sun to rise upon
the evil and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and unjust.”2040</p>
<p>2. And to as many as continue in their love towards God, does He grant communion
with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the enjoyment of all the benefits
which He has in store. But on as many as, according to their own choice, depart from God,
He inflicts that separation from Himself which they have chosen of their own accord. But
separation from God is death, and separation from light is darkness; and separation from
God consists in the loss of all the benefits which He has in store. Those, therefore, who cast
away by apostasy these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do experience

every kind of punishment. God, however, does not punish them immediately of Himself,
but that punishment falls upon them because they are destitute of all that is good. Now,
good things are eternal and without end with God, and therefore the loss of these is also
eternal and never-ending. It is in this matter just as occurs in the case of a flood of light:
those who have blinded themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived
of the enjoyment of light. It is not, [however], that the light has inflicted upon them the
penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself has brought calamity upon them: and
therefore the Lord declared, “He that believeth in Me is not condemned,”2041 that is, is not
separated from God, for he is united to God through faith. On the other hand, He says, “He
that believeth not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the
only-begotten Son of God;” that is, he separated himself from God of his own accord. “For
this is the condemnation, that light is come into this world, and men have loved darkness
rather than light. For every one who doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
may be made manifest, that he has wrought them in God.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—The distinction to be made between the righteous and the
wicked. The future apostasy in the time of Antichrist, and the end of the world.</head>
<p>1. Inasmuch, then, as in this world (αἰῶνι) some persons betake themselves to the light,
and by faith unite themselves with God, but others shun the light, and separate themselves
from God, the Word of God comes preparing a fit habitation for both. For those indeed
who are in the light, that they may derive enjoyment from it, and from the good things
contained in it; but for those in darkness, that they may partake in its calamities. And on
this account He says, that those upon the right hand are called into the kingdom of heaven,
but that those on the left He will send into eternal fire for they have deprived themselves of
all good.</p>
<p>2. And for this reason the apostle says: “Because they received not the love of God, that
they might be saved, therefore God shall also send them the operation of error, that they
may believe a lie, that they all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but consented
to unrighteousness.”2042 For when he (Antichrist) is come, and of his own accord concentrates
in his own person the apostasy, and accomplishes whatever he shall do according to
his own will and choice, sitting also in the temple of God, so that his dupes may adore him
as the Christ; wherefore also shall he deservedly “be cast into the lake of fire:”2043 [this will
happen according to divine appointment], God by His prescience foreseeing all this, and at
the proper time sending such a man, “that they may believe a lie, that they all may be judged
who did not believe the truth, but consented to unrighteousness;” whose coming John has
thus described in the Apocalypse: “And the beast which I had seen was like unto a leopard,
and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon conferred
his own power upon him, and his throne, and great might. And one of his heads was as it
were slain unto death; and his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered after
the beast. And they worshipped the dragon because he gave power to the beast; and they
worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto this beast, and who is able to make war with
him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemy and
power was given to him during forty and two months. And he opened his mouth for blasphemy
against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those who dwell in
heaven. And power was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.
And all who dwell upon the earth worshipped him, [every one] whose name was not written
in the book of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any one have ears, let
him hear. If any one shall lead into captivity, he shall go into captivity. If any shall slay with
the sword, he must be slain with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the
saints.”2044 After this he likewise describes his armour-bearer, whom he also terms a false

prophet: “He spake as a dragon, and exercised all the power of the first beast in his sight,
and caused the earth, and those that dwell therein, to adore the first beast, whose deadly
wound was healed. And he shall perform great wonders, so that he can even cause fire to
descend from heaven upon the earth in the sight of men, and he shall lead the inhabitants
of the earth astray.”2045 Let no one imagine that he performs these wonders by divine power,
but by the working of magic. And we must not be surprised if, since the demons and apostate
spirits are at his service, he through their means performs wonders, by which he leads the
inhabitants of the earth astray. John says further: “And he shall order an image of the beast
to be made, and he shall give breath to the image, so that the image shall speak; and he shall
cause those to be slain who will not adore it.” He says also: “And he will cause a mark [to
be put] in the forehead and in the right hand, that no one may be able to buy or sell, unless
he who has the mark of the name of the beast or the number of his name; and the number
is six hundred and sixty-six,”2046 that is, six times a hundred, six times ten, and six units.
[He gives this] as a summing up of the whole of that apostasy which has taken place during
six thousand years.</p>
<p>3. For in as many days as this world was made, in so many thousand years shall it be
concluded. And for this reason the Scripture says: “Thus the heaven and the earth were
finished, and all their adornment. And God brought to a conclusion upon the sixth day the
works that He had made; and God rested upon the seventh day from all His works.”2047
This is an account of the things formerly created, as also it is a prophecy of what is to come.
For the day of the Lord is as a thousand years;2048 and in six days created things were
completed: it is evident, therefore, that they will come to an end at the sixth thousand year.</p>
<p>4. And therefore throughout all time, man, having been moulded at the beginning by
the hands of God, that is, of the Son and of the Spirit, is made after the image and likeness
of God: the chaff, indeed, which is the apostasy, being cast away; but the wheat, that is, those
who bring forth fruit to God in faith, being gathered into the barn. And for this cause
tribulation is necessary for those who are saved, that having been after a manner broken
up, and rendered fine, and sprinkled over by the patience of the Word of God, and set on
fire [for purification], they may be fitted for the royal banquet. As a certain man of ours
said, when he was condemned to the wild beasts because of his testimony with respect to
God: “I am the wheat of Christ, and am ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may
be found the pure bread of God.”2049</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—All things have been created for the service of man. The deceits,
wickedness, and apostate power of Antichrist. This was prefigured at the deluge,
as afterwards by the persecution of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</head>
<p>1. In the previous books I have set forth the causes for which God permitted these things
to be made, and have pointed out that all such have been created for the benefit of that human
nature which is saved, ripening for immortality that which is [possessed] of its own free will
and its own power, and preparing and rendering it more adapted for eternal subjection to
God. And therefore the creation is suited to [the wants of] man; for man was not made for
its sake, but creation for the sake of man. Those nations, however, who did not of themselves
raise up their eyes unto heaven, nor returned thanks to their Maker, nor wished to behold
the light of truth, but who were like blind mice concealed in the depths of ignorance, the
word justly reckons “as waste water from a sink, and as the turning-weight of a balance—in
fact, as nothing;”2050 so far useful and serviceable to the just, as stubble conduces towards
the growth of the wheat, and its straw, by means of combustion, serves for working gold.
And therefore, when in the end the Church shall be suddenly caught up from this, it is said,
“There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning, neither shall be.”2051
For this is the last contest of the righteous, in which, when they overcome they are crowned
with incorruption.</p>
<p>2. And there is therefore in this beast, when he comes, a recapitulation made of all sorts
of iniquity and of every deceit, in order that all apostate power, flowing into and being shut
up in him, may be sent into the furnace of fire. Fittingly, therefore, shall his name possess
the number six hundred and sixty-six, since he sums up in his own person all the commixture
of wickedness which took place previous to the deluge, due to the apostasy of the angels.
For Noah was six hundred years old when the deluge came upon the earth, sweeping away
the rebellious world, for the sake of that most infamous generation which lived in the times
of Noah. And [Antichrist] also sums up every error of devised idols since the flood, together
with the slaying of the prophets and the cutting off of the just. For that image which was set
up by Nebuchadnezzar had indeed a height of sixty cubits, while the breadth was six cubits;
on account of which Ananias, Azarias, and Mishaell, when they did not worship it, were
cast into a furnace of fire, pointing out prophetically, by what happened to them, the wrath
against the righteous which shall arise towards the [time of the] end. For that image, taken
as a whole, was a prefiguring of this man’s coming, decreeing that he should undoubtedly
himself alone be worshipped by all men. Thus, then, the six hundred years of Noah, in whose
time the deluge occurred because of the apostasy, and the number of the cubits of the image

for which these just men were sent into the fiery furnace, do indicate the number of the
name of that man in whom is concentrated the whole apostasy of six thousand years, and
unrighteousness, and wickedness, and false prophecy, and deception; for which things’ sake
a cataclysm of fire shall also come [upon the earth].</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—Although certain as to the number of the name of Antichrist,
yet we should come to no rash conclusions as to the name itself, because this
number is capable of being fitted to many names. Reasons for this point being
reserved by the Holy Spirit. Antichrist’s reign and death.</head>
<p>1. Such, then, being the state of the case, and this number being found in all the most
approved and ancient copies2052 [of the Apocalypse], and those men who saw John face to
face bearing their testimony [to it]; while reason also leads us to conclude that the number
of the name of the beast, [if reckoned] according to the Greek mode of calculation by the
[value of] the letters contained in it, will amount to six hundred and sixty and six; that is,
the number of tens shall be equal to that of the hundreds, and the number of hundreds equal
to that of the units (for that number which [expresses] the digit six being adhered to
throughout, indicates the recapitulations of that apostasy, taken in its full extent, which occurred
at the beginning, during the intermediate periods, and which shall take place at the
end),—I do not know how it is that some have erred following the ordinary mode of speech,
and have vitiated the middle number in the name, deducting the amount of fifty from it, so
that instead of six decads they will have it that there is but one. [I am inclined to think that
this occurred through the fault of the copyists, as is wont to happen, since numbers also are
expressed by letters; so that the Greek letter which expresses the number sixty was easily
expanded into the letter Iota of the Greeks.]2053 Others then received this reading without
examination; some in their simplicity, and upon their own responsibility, making use of
this number expressing one decad; while some, in their inexperience, have ventured to seek
out a name which should contain the erroneous and spurious number. Now, as regards
those who have done this in simplicity, and without evil intent, we are at liberty to assume
that pardon will be granted them by God. But as for those who, for the sake of vainglory,
lay it down for certain that names containing the spurious number are to be accepted, and
affirm that this name, hit upon by themselves, is that of him who is to come; such persons
shall not come forth without loss, because they have led into error both themselves and
those who confided in them. Now, in the first place, it is loss to wander from the truth, and
to imagine that as being the case which is not; then again, as there shall be no light punishment
[inflicted] upon him who either adds or subtracts anything from the Scripture,2054
under that such a person must necessarily fall. Moreover, another danger, by no means tri-

fling, shall overtake those who falsely presume that they know the name of Antichrist. For
if these men assume one [number], when this [Antichrist] shall come having another, they
will be easily led away by him, as supposing him not to be the expected one, who must be
guarded against.</p>
<p>2. These men, therefore, ought to learn [what really is the state of the case], and go back
to the true number of the name, that they be not reckoned among false prophets. But,
knowing the sure number declared by Scripture, that is, six hundred sixty and six, let them
await, in the first place, the division of the kingdom into ten; then, in the next place, when
these kings are reigning, and beginning to set their affairs in order, and advance their kingdom,
[let them learn] to acknowledge that he who shall come claiming the kingdom for
himself, and shall terrify those men of whom we have been speaking, having a name containing
the aforesaid number, is truly the abomination of desolation. This, too, the apostle
affirms: “When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction shall come upon
them.”2055 And Jeremiah does not merely point out his sudden coming, but he even indicates
the tribe from which he shall come, where he says, “We shall hear the voice of his swift
horses from Dan; the whole earth shall be moved by the voice of the neighing of his galloping
horses: he shall also come and devour the earth, and the fulness thereof, the city also, and
they that dwell therein.”2056 This, too, is the reason that this tribe is not reckoned in the
Apocalypse along with those which are saved.2057</p>
<p>3. It is therefore more certain, and less hazardous, to await the fulfilment of the prophecy,
than to be making surmises, and casting about for any names that may present themselves,
inasmuch as many names can be found possessing the number mentioned; and the same
question will, after all, remain unsolved. For if there are many names found possessing this
number, it will be asked which among them shall the coming man bear. It is not through a
want of names containing the number of that name that I say this, but on account of the
fear of God, and zeal for the truth: for the name Evanthas (ΕΥΑΝΘΑΣ) contains the required
number, but I make no allegation regarding it. Then also Lateinos (ΛΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ) has the
number six hundred and sixty-six; and it is a very probable [solution], this being the name
of the last kingdom [of the four seen by Daniel]. For the Latins are they who at present bear
rule:2058 I will not, however, make any boast over this [coincidence]. Teitan too, (ΤΕΙΤΑΝ,

are found among us, is rather worthy of credit. For it has in itself the predicted number,
and is composed of six letters, each syllable containing three letters; and [the word itself] is
ancient, and removed from ordinary use; for among our kings we find none bearing this
name Titan, nor have any of the idols which are worshipped in public among the Greeks
and barbarians this appellation. Among many persons, too, this name is accounted divine,
so that even the sun is termed “Titan” by those who do now possess [the rule]. This word,
too, contains a certain outward appearance of vengeance, and of one inflicting merited
punishment because he (Antichrist) pretends that he vindicates the oppressed.2059 And
besides this, it is an ancient name, one worthy of credit, of royal dignity, and still further, a
name belonging to a tyrant. Inasmuch, then, as this name “Titan” has so much to recommend
it, there is a strong degree of probability, that from among the many [names suggested], we
infer, that perchance he who is to come shall be called “Titan.” We will not, however, incur
the risk of pronouncing positively as to the name of Antichrist; for if it were necessary that
his name should be distinctly revealed in this present time, it would have been announced
by him who beheld the apocalyptic vision. For that was seen no very long time since, but
almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian’s reign.</p>
<p>4. But he indicates the number of the name now, that when this man comes we may
avoid him, being aware who he is: the name, however, is suppressed, because it is not worthy
of being proclaimed by the Holy Spirit. For if it had been declared by Him, he (Antichrist)
might perhaps continue for a long period. But now as “he was, and is not, and shall ascend
out of the abyss, and goes into perdition,”2060 as one who has no existence; so neither has
his name been declared, for the name of that which does not exist is not proclaimed. But
when this Antichrist shall have devastated all things in this world, he will reign for three
years and six months, and sit in the temple at Jerusalem; and then the Lord will come from
heaven in the clouds, in the glory of the Father, sending this man and those who follow him
into the lake of fire; but bringing in for the righteous the times of the kingdom, that is, the
rest, the hallowed seventh day; and restoring to Abraham the promised inheritance, in which
kingdom the Lord declared, that “many coming from the east and from the west should sit
down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”2061</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—The preservation of our bodies is confirmed by the resurrection
and ascension of Christ: the souls of the saints during the intermediate period
are in a state of expectation of that time when they shall receive their perfect and
consummated glory.</head>
<p>1. Since, again, some who are reckoned among the orthodox go beyond the pre-arranged
plan for the exaltation of the just, and are ignorant of the methods by which they are disciplined
beforehand for incorruption, they thus entertain heretical opinions. For the heretics,
despising the handiwork of God, and not admitting the salvation of their flesh, while they
also treat the promise of God contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments
they form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above the
heavens and the Demiurge, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to that Father whom they
have feigned. Those persons, therefore, who disallow a resurrection affecting the whole man
(universam reprobant resurrectionem), and as far as in them lies remove it from the midst
[of the Christian scheme], how can they be wondered at, if again they know nothing as to
the plan of the resurrection? For they do not choose to understand, that if these things are
as they say, the Lord Himself, in whom they profess to believe, did not rise again upon the
third day; but immediately upon His expiring on the cross, undoubtedly departed on high,
leaving His body to the earth. But the case was, that for three days He dwelt in the place
where the dead were, as the prophet says concerning Him: “And the Lord remembered His
dead saints who slept formerly in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them, to rescue
and save them.”2062 And the Lord Himself says, “As Jonas remained three days and three
nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth.”2063 Then
also the apostle says, “But when He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the
lower parts of the earth?”2064 This, too, David says when prophesying of Him, “And thou
hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hell;”2065 and on His rising again the third day,
He said to Mary, who was the first to see and to worship Him, “Touch Me not, for I have
not yet ascended to the Father; but go to the disciples, and say unto them, I ascend unto My
Father, and unto your Father.”2066</p>
<p>2. If, then, the Lord observed the law of the dead, that He might become the first-begotten
from the dead, and tarried until the third day “in the lower parts of the earth;”2067 then afterwards
rising in the flesh, so that He even showed the print of the nails to His disciples,2068

He thus ascended to the Father;—[if all these things occurred, I say], how must these men
not be put to confusion, who allege that “the lower parts” refer to this world of ours, but
that their inner man, leaving the body here, ascends into the super-celestial place? For as
the Lord “went away in the midst of the shadow of death,”2069 where the souls of the dead
were, yet afterwards arose in the body, and after the resurrection was taken up [into heaven],
it is manifest that the souls of His disciples also, upon whose account the Lord underwent
these things, shall go away into the invisible place allotted to them by God, and there remain
until the resurrection, awaiting that event; then receiving their bodies, and rising in their
entirety, that is bodily, just as the Lord arose, they shall come thus into the presence of God.
“For no disciple is above the Master, but every one that is perfect shall be as his Master.”2070
As our Master, therefore, did not at once depart, taking flight [to heaven], but awaited the
time of His resurrection prescribed by the Father, which had been also shown forth through
Jonas, and rising again after three days was taken up [to heaven]; so ought we also to await
the time of our resurrection prescribed by God and foretold by the prophets, and so, rising,
be taken up, as many as the Lord shall account worthy of this [privilege].2071</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—In that flesh in which the saints have suffered so many
afflictions, they shall receive the fruits of their labours; especially since all creation
waits for this, and God promises it to Abraham and his seed.</head>
<p>1. Inasmuch, therefore, as the opinions of certain [orthodox persons] are derived from
heretical discourses, they are both ignorant of God’s dispensations, and of the mystery of
the resurrection of the just, and of the [earthly] kingdom which is the commencement of
incorruption, by means of which kingdom those who shall be worthy are accustomed
gradually to partake of the divine nature (capere Deum2072); and it is necessary to tell them
respecting those things, that it behoves the righteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance
which God promised to the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise again to behold
God in this creation which is renovated, and that the judgment should take place afterwards.
For it is just that in that very creation in which they toiled or were afflicted, being proved
in every way by suffering, they should receive the reward of their suffering; and that in the
creation in which they were slain because of their love to God, in that they should be revived
again; and that in the creation in which they endured servitude, in that they should reign.
For God is rich in all things, and all things are His. It is fitting, therefore, that the creation
itself, being restored to its primeval condition, should without restraint be under the
dominion of the righteous; and the apostle has made this plain in the Epistle to the Romans,
when he thus speaks: “For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of
the sons of God. For the creature has been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason
of him who hath subjected the same in hope; since the creature itself shall also be delivered
from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.”2073</p>
<p>2. Thus, then, the promise of God, which He gave to Abraham, remains stedfast. For
thus He said: “Lift up thine eyes, and look from this place where now thou art, towards the
north and south, and east and west. For all the earth which thou seest, I will give to thee and
to thy seed, even for ever.”2074 And again He says, “Arise, and go through the length and
breadth of the land, since I will give it unto thee;”2075 and [yet] he did not receive an inheritance
in it, not even a footstep, but was always a stranger and a pilgrim therein.2076 And
upon the death of Sarah his wife, when the Hittites were willing to bestow upon him a place
where he might bury her, he declined it as a gift, but bought the burying-place (giving for
it four hundred talents of silver) from Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite.2077 Thus did he

await patiently the promise of God, and was unwilling to appear to receive from men, what
God had promised to give him, when He said again to him as follows: “I will give this land
to thy seed, from the river of Egypt even unto the great river Euphrates.”2078 If, then, God
promised him the inheritance of the land, yet he did not receive it during all the time of his
sojourn there, it must be, that together with his seed, that is, those who fear God and believe
in Him, he shall receive it at the resurrection of the just. For his seed is the Church, which
receives the adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist said: “For God is able
from the stones to raise up children to Abraham.”2079 Thus also the apostle says in the
Epistle to the Galatians: “But ye, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of the promise.”2080
And again, in the same Epistle, he plainly declares that they who have believed in Christ do
receive Christ, the promise to Abraham thus saying, “The promises were spoken to Abraham,
and to his seed. Now He does not say, And of seeds, as if [He spake] of many, but as of one,
And to thy seed, which is Christ.”2081 And again, confirming his former words, he says,
“Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye
therefore, that they which are of faith are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing
that God would justify the heathen through faith, declared to Abraham beforehand,
That in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which are of faith shall be blessed with
faithful Abraham.”2082 Thus, then, they who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham,
and these are the children of Abraham. Now God made promise of the earth to Abraham
and his seed; yet neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by faith,
do now receive any inheritance in it; but they shall receive it at the resurrection of the just.
For God is true and faithful; and on this account He said, “Blessed are the meek, for they
shall inherit the earth.”2083</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Further proofs of the same proposition, drawn from the
promises made by Christ, when He declared that He would drink of the fruit of
the vine with His disciples in His Father’s kingdom, while at the same time He
promised to reward them an hundred-fold, and to make them partake of
banquets. The blessing pronounced by Jacob had pointed out this already, as
Papias and the elders have interpreted it.</head>
<p>1. For this reason, when about to undergo His sufferings, that He might declare to Abraham
and those with him the glad tidings of the inheritance being thrown open, [Christ],
after He had given thanks while holding the cup, and had drunk of it, and given it to the
disciples, said to them: “Drink ye all of it: this is My blood of the new covenant, which shall
be shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth
of the fruit of this vine, until that day when I will drink it new with you in my Father’s
kingdom.”2084 Thus, then, He will Himself renew the inheritance of the earth, and will reorganize
the mystery of the glory of [His] sons; as David says, “He who hath renewed the
face of the earth.”2085 He promised to drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples, thus
indicating both these points: the inheritance of the earth in which the new fruit of the vine
is drunk, and the resurrection of His disciples in the flesh. For the new flesh which rises
again is the same which also received the new cup. And He cannot by any means be understood
as drinking of the fruit of the vine when settled down with his [disciples] above in a
super-celestial place; nor, again, are they who drink it devoid of flesh, for to drink of that
which flows from the vine pertains to flesh, and not spirit.</p>
<p>2. And for this reason the Lord declared, “When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do
not call thy friends, nor thy neighbours, nor thy kinsfolk, lest they ask thee in return, and
so repay thee. But call the lame, the blind, and the poor, and thou shall be blessed, since
they cannot recompense thee, but a recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of
the just.”2086 And again He says, “Whosoever shall have left lands, or houses, or parents,
or brethren, or children because of Me, he shall receive in this world an hundred-fold, and
in that to come he shall inherit eternal life.”2087 For what are the hundred-fold [rewards]
in this word, the entertainments given to the poor, and the suppers for which a return is
made? These are [to take place] in the times of the kingdom, that is, upon the seventh day,
which has been sanctified, in which God rested from all the works which He created, which
is the true Sabbath of the righteous, which they shall not be engaged in any earthly occupa-

tion; but shall have a table at hand prepared for them by God, supplying them with all sorts

<p>3. The blessing of Isaac with which he blessed his younger son Jacob has the same
meaning, when he says, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the
Lord has blessed.”2088 But “the field is the world.”2089 And therefore he added, “God give
to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine. And
let the nations serve thee, and kings bow down to thee; and be thou lord over thy brother,
and thy father’s sons shall bow down to thee: cursed shall be he who shall curse thee, and
blessed shall be he who shall bless thee.”2090 If any one, then, does not accept these things
as referring to the appointed kingdom, he must fall into much contradiction and contrariety,
as is the case with the Jews, who are involved in absolute perplexity. For not only did not
the nations in this life serve this Jacob; but even after he had received the blessing, he himself
going forth [from his home], served his uncle Laban the Syrian for twenty years;2091 and
not only was he not made lord of his brother, but he did himself bow down before his
brother Esau, upon his return from Mesopotamia to his father, and offered many gifts to
him.2092 Moreover, in what way did he inherit much corn and wine here, he who emigrated
to Egypt because of the famine which possessed the land in which he was dwelling, and became
subject to Pharaoh, who was then ruling over Egypt? The predicted blessing, therefore,
belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom, when the righteous shall bear rule
upon their rising from the dead;2093 when also the creation, having been renovated and set
free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven, and from
the fertility of the earth: as the elders who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, related that
they had heard from him how the Lord used to teach in regard to these times, and say: The
days will come, in which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each
branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true2094 twig ten thousand shoots, and in each one
of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes,
and every grape when pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any
one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster,2095 another shall cry out, “I am a better cluster,

take me; bless the Lord through me.” In like manner [the Lord declared] that a grain of
wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear should have ten thousand grains,
and every grain would yield ten pounds (quinque bilibres) of clear, pure, fine flour; and that
all other fruit-bearing trees,2096 and seeds and grass, would produce in similar proportions
(secundum congruentiam iis consequentem); and that all animals feeding [only] on the productions
of the earth, should [in those days] become peaceful and harmonious among each
other, and be in perfect subjection to man.</p>
<p>4. And these things are borne witness to in writing by Papias, the hearer of John, and a
companion of Polycarp, in his fourth book; for there were five books compiled
(συντεταγμένα) by him.2097 And he says in addition, “Now these things are credible to believers.”
And he says that, “when the traitor Judas did not give credit to them, and put the
question, ‘How then can things about to bring forth so abundantly be wrought by the Lord?’
the Lord declared, ‘They who shall come to these [times] shall see.’ ” When prophesying of
these times, therefore, Esaias says: “The wolf also shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard
shall take his rest with the kid; the calf also, and the bull, and the lion shall eat together; and
a little boy shall lead them. The ox and the bear shall feed together, and their young ones
shall agree together; and the lion shall eat straw as well as the ox. And the infant boy shall
thrust his hand into the asp’s den, into the nest also of the adder’s brood; and they shall do
no harm, nor have power to hurt anything in my holy mountain.” And again he says, in
recapitulation, “Wolves and lambs shall then browse together, and the lion shall eat straw
like the ox, and the serpent earth as if it were bread; and they shall neither hurt nor annoy
anything in my holy mountain, saith the Lord.”2098 I am quite aware that some persons
endeavour to refer these words to the case of savage men, both of different nations and
various habits, who come to believe, and when they have believed, act in harmony with the
righteous. But although this is [true] now with regard to some men coming from various
nations to the harmony of the faith, nevertheless in the resurrection of the just [the words
shall also apply] to those animals mentioned. For God is rich in all things. And it is right
that when the creation is restored, all the animals should obey and be in subjection to man,
and revert to the food originally given by God (for they had been originally subjected in
obedience to Adam), that is, the productions of the earth. But some other occasion, and not
the present, is [to be sought] for showing that the lion shall [then] feed on straw. And this
indicates the large size and rich quality of the fruits. For if that animal, the lion, feeds upon
straw [at that period], of what a quality must the wheat itself be whose straw shall serve as
suitable food for lions?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—He fortifies his opinions with regard to the temporal and
earthly kingdom of the saints after their resurrection, by the various testimonies
of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel; also by the parable of the servants
watching, to whom the Lord promised that He would minister.</head>
<p>1. Then, too, Isaiah himself has plainly declared that there shall be joy of this nature at
the resurrection of the just, when he says: “The dead shall rise again; those, too, who are in
the tombs shall arise, and those who are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew from Thee is
health to them.”2099 And this again Ezekiel also says: “Behold, I will open your tombs, and
will bring you forth out of your graves; when I will draw my people from the sepulchres,
and I will put breath in you, and ye shall live; and I will place you on your own land, and ye
shall know that I am the Lord.”2100 And again the same speaks thus: “These things saith the
Lord, I will gather Israel from all nations whither they have been driven, and I shall be
sanctified in them in the sight of the sons of the nations: and they shall dwell in their own
land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell in it in peace; and they shall
build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell in hope, when I shall cause judgment to fall
among all who have dishonoured them, among those who encircle them round about; and
they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the God of their fathers.”2101 Now I have
shown a short time ago that the church is the seed of Abraham; and for this reason, that we
may know that He who in the New Testament “raises up from the stones children unto
Abraham,”2102 is He who will gather, according to the Old Testament, those that shall be
saved from all the nations, Jeremiah says: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they
shall no more say, The Lord liveth, who led the children of Israel from the north, and from
every region whither they had been driven; He will restore them to their own land which
He gave to their fathers.”2103</p>
<p>2. That the whole creation shall, according to God’s will, obtain a vast increase, that it
may bring forth and sustain fruits such [as we have mentioned], Isaiah declares: “And there
shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every prominent hill, water running everywhere
in that day, when many shall perish, when walls shall fall. And the light of the moon shall
be as the light of the sun, seven times that of the day, when He shall heal the anguish of His
people, and do away with the pain of His stroke.”2104 Now “the pain of the stroke” means
that inflicted at the beginning upon disobedient man in Adam, that is, death; which [stroke]

the Lord will heal when He raises us from the dead, and restores the inheritance of the
fathers, as Isaiah again says: “And thou shall be confident in the Lord, and He will cause
thee to pass over the whole earth, and feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father.”2105
This is what the Lord declared: “Happy are those servants whom the Lord when He cometh
shall find watching. Verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit
down [to meat], and will come forth and serve them. And if He shall come in the evening
watch, and find them so, blessed are they, because He shall make them sit down, and minister
to them; or if this be in the second, or it be in the third, blessed are they.”2106 Again John
also says the very same in the Apocalypse: “Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first
resurrection.”2107 Then, too, Isaiah has declared the time when these events shall occur; he
says: “And I said, Lord, how long? Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the
houses be without men, and the earth be left a desert. And after these things the Lord shall
remove us men far away (longe nos faciet Deus homines), and those who shall remain shall
multiply upon the earth.”2108 Then Daniel also says this very thing: “And the kingdom and
dominion, and the greatness of those under the heaven, is given to the saints of the Most
High God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.”2109
And lest the promise named should be understood as referring to this time, it was declared
to the prophet: “And come thou, and stand in thy lot at the consummation of the days.”2110</p>
<p>3. Now, that the promises were not announced to the prophets and the fathers alone,
but to the Churches united to these from the nations, whom also the Spirit terms “the islands”
(both because they are established in the midst of turbulence, suffer the storm of blasphemies,
exist as a harbour of safety to those in peril, and are the refuge of those who love the height
[of heaven], and strive to avoid Bythus, that is, the depth of error), Jeremiah thus declares:
“Hear the word of the Lord, ye nations, and declare it to the isles afar off; say ye, that the
Lord will scatter Israel, He will gather him, and keep him, as one feeding his flock of sheep.
For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and rescued him from the hand of one stronger than
he. And they shall come and rejoice in Mount Zion, and shall come to what is good, and
into a land of wheat, and wine, and fruits, of animals and of sheep; and their soul shall be
as a tree bearing fruit, and they shall hunger no more. At that time also shall the virgins rejoice
in the company of the young men: the old men, too, shall be glad, and I will turn their sorrow
into joy; and I will make them exult, and will magnify them, and satiate the souls of the

priests the sons of Levi; and my people shall be satiated with my goodness.”2111 Now, in the
preceding book2112 I have shown that all the disciples of the Lord are Levites and priests,
they who used in the temple to profane the Sabbath, but are blameless.2113 Promises of such
a nature, therefore, do indicate in the clearest manner the feasting of that creation in the
kingdom of the righteous, which God promises that He will Himself serve.</p>
<p>4. Then again, speaking of Jerusalem, and of Him reigning there, Isaiah declares, “Thus
saith the Lord, Happy is he who hath seed in Zion, and servants in Jerusalem. Behold, a
righteous king shall reign, and princes shall rule with judgment.”2114 And with regard to
the foundation on which it shall be rebuilt, he says: “Behold, I will lay in order for thee a
carbuncle stone, and sapphire for thy foundations; and I will lay thy ramparts with jasper,
and thy gates with crystal, and thy wall with choice stones: and all thy children shall be
taught of God, and great shall be the peace of thy children; and in righteousness shalt thou
be built up.”2115 And yet again does he say the same thing: “Behold, I make Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and my people [a joy]; for the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor
the voice of crying. Also there shall not be there any immature [one], nor an old man who
does not fulfil his time: for the youth shall be of a hundred years; and the sinner shall die a
hundred years old, yet shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them
themselves; and shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them themselves, and shall drink
wine. And they shall not build, and others inhabit; neither shall they prepare the vineyard,
and others eat. For as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of the people in thee; for
the works of their hands shall endure.”2116</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—He contends that these testimonies already alleged cannot be
understood allegorically of celestial blessings, but that they shall have their
fulfilment after the coming of Antichrist, and the resurrection, in the terrestrial
Jerusalem. To the former prophecies he subjoins others drawn from Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and the Apocalypse of John.</head>
<p>1. If, however, any shall endeavour to allegorize [prophecies] of this kind, they shall not
be found consistent with themselves in all points, and shall be confuted by the teaching of
the very expressions [in question]. For example: “When the cities” of the Gentiles “shall be
desolate, so that they be not inhabited, and the houses so that there shall be no men in them
and the land shall be left desolate.”2117 “For, behold,” says Isaiah, “the day of the Lord cometh
past remedy, full of fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to root sinners out
of it.”2118 And again he says, “Let him be taken away, that he behold not the glory of
God.”2119 And when these things are done, he says, “God will remove men far away, and
those that are left shall multiply in the earth.”2120 “And they shall build houses, and shall
inhabit them themselves: and plant vineyards, and eat of them themselves.”2121 For all these
and other words were unquestionably spoken in reference to the resurrection of the just,
which takes place after the coming of Antichrist, and the destruction of all nations under
his rule; in [the times of] which [resurrection] the righteous shall reign in the earth, waxing
stronger by the sight of the Lord: and through Him they shall become accustomed to partake
in the glory of God the Father, and shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and communion
with the holy angels, and union with spiritual beings; and [with respect to] those whom the
Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from heaven, and who have suffered tribulation,
as well as escaped the hands of the Wicked one. For it is in reference to them that the
prophet says: “And those that are left shall multiply upon the earth,” And Jeremiah2122 the
prophet has pointed out, that as many believers as God has prepared for this purpose, to
multiply those left upon earth, should both be under the rule of the saints to minister to this
Jerusalem, and that [His] kingdom shall be in it, saying, “Look around Jerusalem towards
the east, and behold the joy which comes to thee from God Himself. Behold, thy sons shall
come whom thou hast sent forth: they shall come in a band from the east even unto the
west, by the word of that Holy One, rejoicing in that splendour which is from thy God. O

Jerusalem, put off thy robe of mourning and of affliction, and put on that beauty of eternal
splendour from thy God. Gird thyself with the double garment of that righteousness proceeding
from thy God; place the mitre of eternal glory upon thine head. For God will show
thy glory to the whole earth under heaven. For thy name shall for ever be called by God
Himself, the peace of righteousness and glory to him that worships God. Arise, Jerusalem,
stand on high, and look towards the east, and behold thy sons from the rising of the sun,
even to the west, by the Word of that Holy One, rejoicing in the very remembrance of God.
For the footmen have gone forth from thee, while they were drawn away by the enemy. God
shall bring them in to thee, being borne with glory as the throne of a kingdom. For God has
decreed that every high mountain shall be brought low, and the eternal hills, and that the
valleys be filled, so that the surface of the earth be rendered smooth, that Israel, the glory of
God, may walk in safety. The woods, too, shall make shady places, and every sweet-smelling
tree shall be for Israel itself by the command of God. For God shall go before with joy in the
light of His splendour, with the pity and righteousness which proceeds from Him.”</p>
<p>2. Now all these things being such as they are, cannot be understood in reference to
super-celestial matters; “for God,” it is said, “will show to the whole earth that is under
heaven thy glory.” But in the times of the kingdom, the earth has been called again by Christ
[to its pristine condition], and Jerusalem rebuilt after the pattern of the Jerusalem above, of
which the prophet Isaiah says, “Behold, I have depicted thy walls upon my hands, and thou
art always in my sight.”2123 And the apostle, too, writing to the Galatians, says in like
manner, “But the Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.”2124 He
does not say this with any thought of an erratic Æon, or of any other power which departed
from the Pleroma, or of Prunicus, but of the Jerusalem which has been delineated on [God’s]
hands. And in the Apocalypse John saw this new [Jerusalem] descending upon the new
earth.2125 For after the times of the kingdom, he says, “I saw a great white throne, and Him
who sat upon it, from whose face the earth fled away, and the heavens; and there was no
more place for them.”2126 And he sets forth, too, the things connected with the general resurrection
and the judgment, mentioning “the dead, great and small.” “The sea,” he says,
“gave up the dead which it had in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead that they
contained; and the books were opened. Moreover,” he says, “the book of life was opened,
and the dead were judged out of those things that were written in the books, according to
their works; and death and hell were sent into the lake of fire, the second death.”2127 Now

this is what is called Gehenna, which the Lord styled eternal fire.2128 “And if any one,” it is
said, “was not found written in the book of life, he was sent into the lake of fire.”2129 And
after this, he says, “I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth have
passed away; also there was no more sea. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming
down from heaven, as a bride adorned for her husband.” “And I heard,” it is said, “a great
voice from the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell
with them; and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them as their God.
And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, because the former things have passed
away.”2130 Isaiah also declares the very same: “For there shall be a new heaven and a new
earth; and there shall be no remembrance of the former, neither shall the heart think about
them, but they shall find in it joy and exultation.”2131 Now this is what has been said by the
apostle: “For the fashion of this world passeth away.”2132 To the same purpose did the Lord
also declare, “Heaven and earth shall pass away.”2133 When these things, therefore, pass
away above the earth, John, the Lord’s disciple, says that the new Jerusalem above shall
[then] descend, as a bride adorned for her husband; and that this is the tabernacle of God,
in which God will dwell with men. Of this Jerusalem the former one is an image—that Jerusalem
of the former earth in which the righteous are disciplined beforehand for incorruption
and prepared for salvation. And of this tabernacle Moses received the pattern in the
mount;2134 and nothing is capable of being allegorized, but all things are stedfast, and true,
and substantial, having been made by God for righteous men’s enjoyment. For as it is God
truly who raises up man, so also does man truly rise from the dead, and not allegorically, as
I have shown repeatedly. And as he rises actually, so also shall he be actually disciplined
beforehand for incorruption, and shall go forwards and flourish in the times of the kingdom,
in order that he may be capable of receiving the glory of the Father. Then, when all things
are made new, he shall truly dwell in the city of God. For it is said, “He that sitteth on the
throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And the Lord says, Write all this; for these words
are faithful and true. And He said to me, They are done.”2135 And this is the truth of the
matter.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—Men shall be actually raised: the world shall not be annihilated;
but there shall be various mansions for the saints, according to the rank allotted
to each individual. All things shall be subject to God the Father, and so shall He
be all in all.</head>
<p>1. For since there are real men, so must there also be a real establishment (plantationem),
that they vanish not away among non-existent things, but progress among those which have
an actual existence. For neither is the substance nor the essence of the creation annihilated
(for faithful and true is He who has established it), but “the fashion of the world passeth
away;”2136 that is, those things among which transgression has occurred, since man has
grown old in them. And therefore this [present] fashion has been formed temporary, God
foreknowing all things; as I have pointed out in the preceding book,2137 and have also shown,
as far as was possible, the cause of the creation of this world of temporal things. But when
this [present] fashion [of things] passes away, and man has been renewed, and flourishes
in an incorruptible state, so as to preclude the possibility of becoming old, [then] there shall
be the new heaven and the new earth, in which the new man shall remain [continually],
always holding fresh converse with God. And since (or, that) these things shall ever continue
without end, Isaiah declares, “For as the new heavens and the new earth which I do make,
continue in my sight, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.”2138 And
as the presbyters say, Then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall go
there, others shall enjoy the delights of paradise, and others shall possess the splendour of
the city; for everywhere the Saviour2139 shall be seen according as they who see Him shall
be worthy.</p>
<p>2. [They say, moreover], that there is this distinction between the habitation of those
who produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who produce sixty-fold, and that of those
who produce thirty-fold: for the first will be taken up into the heavens, the second will dwell
in paradise, the last will inhabit the city; and that was on this account the Lord declared, “In
My Father’s house are many mansions.”2140 For all things belong to God, who supplies all
with a suitable dwelling-place; even as His Word says, that a share is allotted to all by the
Father, according as each person is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch on which the
guests shall recline, having been invited to the wedding.2141 The presbyters, the disciples of
the apostles, affirm that this is the gradation and arrangement of those who are saved, and

that they advance through steps of this nature; also that they ascend through the Spirit to
the Son, and through the Son to the Father, and that in due time the Son will yield up His
work to the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, “For He must reign till He hath put all
enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”2142 For in the times
of the kingdom, the righteous man who is upon the earth shall then forget to die. “But when
He saith, All things shall be subdued unto Him, it is manifest that He is excepted who did
put all things under Him. And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the
Son also Himself be subject unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all
in all.”2143</p>
<p>3. John, therefore, did distinctly foresee the first “resurrection of the just,”2144 and the
inheritance in the kingdom of the earth; and what the prophets have prophesied concerning
it harmonize [with his vision]. For the Lord also taught these things, when He promised
that He would have the mixed cup new with His disciples in the kingdom. The apostle, too,
has confessed that the creation shall be free from the bondage of corruption, [so as to pass]
into the liberty of the sons of God.2145 And in all these things, and by them all, the same
God the Father is manifested, who fashioned man, and gave promise of the inheritance of
the earth to the fathers, who brought it (the creature) forth [from bondage] at the resurrection
of the just, and fulfils the promises for the kingdom of His Son; subsequently bestowing in
a paternal manner those things which neither the eye has seen, nor the ear has heard, nor
has [thought concerning them] arisen within the heart of man,2146 For there is the one Son,
who accomplished His Father’s will; and one human race also in which the mysteries of
God are wrought, “which the angels desire to look into;”2147 and they are not able to search

<p>These2150 opinions, Florinus, that I may speak in mild terms, are not of sound doctrine;
these opinions are not consonant to the Church, and involve their votaries in the utmost
impiety; these opinions, even the heretics beyond the Church’s pale have never ventured to
broach; these opinions, those presbyters who preceded us, and who were conversant with
the apostles, did not hand down to thee. For, while I was yet a boy, I saw thee in Lower Asia
with Polycarp, distinguishing thyself in the royal court,2151 and endeavouring to gain his
approbation. For I have a more vivid recollection of what occurred at that time than of recent
events (inasmuch as the experiences of childhood, keeping pace with the growth of the soul,
become incorporated with it); so that I can even describe the place where the blessed Polycarp
used to sit and discourse— his going out, too, and his coming in—his general mode of life
and personal appearance, together with the discourses which he delivered to the people;
also how he would speak of his familiar intercourse with John, and with the rest of those
who had seen the Lord; and how he would call their words to remembrance. Whatsoever
things he had heard from them respecting the Lord, both with regard to His miracles and
His teaching, Polycarp having thus received [information] from the eye-witnesses of the
Word of life, would recount them all in harmony with the Scriptures. These things, through,
God’s mercy which was upon me, I then listened to attentively, and treasured them up not
on paper, but in my heart; and I am continually, by God’s grace, revolving these things accurately
in my mind. And I can bear witness before God, that if that blessed and apostolical
presbyter had heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and stopped his ears, exclaiming
as he was wont to do: “O good God, for what times hast Thou reserved me, that I should
endure these things?” And he would have fled from the very spot where, sitting or standing,
he had heard such words. This fact, too, can be made clear, from his Epistles which he despatched,
whether to the neighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to certain of the
brethren, admonishing and exhorting them.</p>
<note type="footnote">2150 This interesting extract we also owe to Eusebius, who (ut sup.) took it from the work De Ogdoade, written
after this former friend of Irenæus had lapsed to Valentinianism. Florinus had previously held that God was the
author of evil, which sentiment Irenæus opposed in a treatise, now lost, called περὶ μοναρχίας.</note>

<p>For2152 the controversy is not merely as regards the day, but also as regards the form
itself of the fast.2153 For some consider themselves bound to fast one day, others two days,
others still more, while others [do so during] forty: the diurnal and the nocturnal hours they
measure out together as their [fasting] day.2154 And this variety among the observers [of
the fasts] had not its origin in our time, but long before in that of our predecessors, some
of whom probably, being not very accurate in their observance of it, handed down to posterity
the custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy, been [introduced among
them]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in peace one with another, and we also keep peace
together. Thus, in fact, the difference [in observing] the fast establishes the harmony of [our
common] faith.2155 And the presbyters preceding Soter in the government of the Church
which thou dost now rule—I mean, Anicetus and Pius, Hyginus and Telesphorus, and Sixtus—
did neither themselves observe it [after that fashion], nor permit those with them2156
to do so. Notwithstanding this, those who did not keep [the feast in this way] were peacefully
disposed towards those who came to them from other dioceses in which it was [so] observed
although such observance was [felt] in more decided contrariety [as presented] to those
who did not fall in with it; and none were ever cast out [of the Church] for this matter. On
the contrary, those presbyters who preceded thee, and who did not observe [this custom],
sent the Eucharist to those of other dioceses who did observe it.2157 And when the blessed
Polycarp was sojourning in Rome in the time of Anicetus, although a slight controversy had
arisen among them as to certain other points, they were at once well inclined towards each
other [with regard to the matter in hand], not willing that any quarrel should arise between
them upon this head. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp to forego the observance
<note type="footnote">2152 See pp. 31 and 312, of this volume. We are indebted again to Eusebius for this valuable fragment from
the Epistle of Irenæus to Victor Bishop of Rome (Hist. Eccl., v. 24; copied also by Nicephorus, iv. 39). It appears
to have been a synodical epistle to the head of the Roman Church, the historian saying that it was written by
Irenæus, “in the name of (ἐκ προσώπου) those brethren over whom he ruled throughout Gaul.” Neither are
these expressions to be limited to the Church at Lyons, for the same authority records (v. 23) that it was the
testimony “of the dioceses throughout Gaul, which Irenæus superintended” (Harvey).</note>
<note type="footnote">2153 According to Harvey, the early paschal controversy resolved itself into two particulars: (a) as regards
the precise day on which our Lord’s resurrection should be celebrated; (b) as regards the custom of the fast
preceding it.</note>
<note type="footnote">2154 Both reading and punctuation are here subjects of controversy. We have followed Massuet and Harvey.</note>
<note type="footnote">2155 “The observance of a day, though not everywhere the same, showed unity, so far as faith in the Lord’s
resurrection was concerned.”—Harvey.</note>
<note type="footnote">2156 Following the reading of Rufinus, the ordinary text has μετ’ αὐτούς, i.e., after them.</note>
<note type="footnote">2157 This practice was afterwards forbidden by the Council of Laodicea [held about a.d. 360].</note>

<pb n="1396"/>
[in his own way], inasmuch as these things had been always [so] observed by John the disciple
of our Lord, and by other apostles with whom he had been conversant; nor, on the other
hand, could Polycarp succeed in persuading Anicetus to keep [the observance in his way],
for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to the usage of the presbyters who preceded
him. And in this state of affairs they held fellowship with each other; and Anicetus conceded
to Polycarp in the Church the celebration of the Eucharist, by way of showing him respect;
so that they parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with the whole Church,
both those who did observe [this custom] and those who did not.2158</p>
<note type="footnote">2158 It was perhaps in reference to this pleasing episode in the annals of the Church, that the Council of Arles,
a.d. 314, decreed that the holy Eucharist should be consecrated by any foreign bishop present at its celebration.</note>

<p>The2161 will and the energy of God is the effective and foreseeing cause of every time
and place and age, and of every nature. The will is the reason (λόγος) of the intellectual soul,
which [reason] is within us, inasmuch as it is the faculty belonging to it which is endowed
with freedom of action. The will is the mind desiring [some object], and an appetite possessed
of intelligence, yearning after that thing which is desired.</p>
<note type="footnote">2161 Also quoted by Maximus Turinensis, Op. ii. 152, who refers it to Irenæus’s Sermo de Fide, which work,
not being referred to by Eusebius or Jerome, causes Massuet to doubt the authenticity of the fragment. Harvey,
however, accepts it.</note>

<p>Since2162 God is vast, and the Architect of the world, and omnipotent, He created things
that reach to immensity both by the Architect of the world and by an omnipotent will, and
with a new effect, potently and efficaciously, in order that the entire fulness of those things
which have been produced might come into being, although they had no previous existence—
that is, whatever does not fall under [our] observation, and also what lies before our
eyes. And so does He contain all things in particular, and leads them on to their own proper
result, on account of which they were called into being and produced, in no way changed
into anything else than what it (the end) had originally been by nature. For this is the
property of the working of God, not merely to proceed to the infinitude of the understanding,
or even to overpass [our] powers of mind, reason and speech, time and place, and every age;
but also to go beyond substance, and fulness or perfection.</p>
<note type="footnote">2162 We owe this fragment also to Maximus, who quoted it from the same work, de Fide, written by Irenæus
to Demetrius, a deacon of Vienne. This and the last fragment were first printed by Feuardentius, who obtained
them from Faber; no reference, however, being given as to the source from whence the Latin version was derived.

<p>This2163 [custom], of not bending the knee upon Sunday, is a symbol of the resurrection,
through which we have been set free, by the grace of Christ, from sins, and from death,
which has been put to death under Him. Now this custom took its rise from apostolic times,
as the blessed Irenæus, the martyr and bishop of Lyons, declares in his treatise On Easter,
in which he makes mention of Pentecost also; upon which [feast] we do not bend the knee,
because it is of equal significance with the Lord’s day, for the reason already alleged concerning
it.</p>
<note type="footnote">2163 Taken from a work (Quæs. et Resp. ad Othod.) ascribed to Justin Martyr, but certainly written after the
Nicene Council. It is evident that this is not an exact quotation from Irenæus, but a summary of his words. The

<p>We therefore have formed the belief that [our] bodies also do rise again. For although
they go to corruption, yet they do not perish; for the earth, receiving the remains, preserves
them, even like fertile seed mixed with more fertile ground. Again, as a bare grain is sown,
and, germinating by the command of God its Creator, rises again, clothed upon and glorious,
but not before it has died and suffered decomposition, and become mingled with the earth;
so [it is seen from this, that] we have not entertained a vain belief in the resurrection of the
body. But although it is dissolved at the appointed time, because of the primeval disobedience,
it is placed, as it were, in the crucible of the earth, to be recast again; not then as this corruptible
[body], but pure, and no longer subject to decay: so that to each body its own soul shall
be restored; and when it is clothed upon with this, it shall not experience sorrow, but shall
rejoice, continuing permanently in a state of purity, having for its companion a just consort,
not an insidious one, possessing in every respect the things pertaining to it, it shall receive
these with perfect accuracy;2167 it shall not receive bodies diverse from what they had been,
nor delivered from suffering or disease, nor as [rendered] glorious, but as they departed this
life, in sins or in righteous actions: and such as they were, such shall they be clothed with
upon resuming life; and such as they were in unbelief, such shall they be faithfully judged.</p>

<p>For2168 when the Greeks, having arrested the slaves of Christian catechumens, then
used force against them, in order to learn from them some secret thing [practised] among
Christians, these slaves, having nothing to say that would meet the wishes of their tormentors,
except that they had heard from their masters that the divine communion was the body and
blood of Christ, and imagining that it was actually flesh and blood, gave their inquisitors
answer to that effect. Then these latter, assuming such to be the case with regard to the
practices of Christians, gave information regarding it to other Greeks, and sought to compel
the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina to confess, under the influence of torture, [that the allegation
was correct]. To these men Blandina replied very admirably in these words: “How
should those persons endure such [accusations], who, for the sake of the practice [of piety],
did not avail themselves even of the flesh that was permitted [them to eat]?”</p>

<p>How2169 is it possible to say that the serpent, created by God dumb and irrational, was
endowed with reason and speech? For if it had the power of itself to speak, to discern, to
understand, and to reply to what was spoken by the woman, there would have been nothing
to prevent every serpent from doing this also. If, however, they say again that it was according
to the divine will and dispensation that this [serpent] spake with a human voice to Eve, they
render God the author of sin. Neither was it possible for the evil demon to impart speech
to a speechless nature, and thus from that which is not to produce that which is; for if that
were the case, he never would have ceased (with the view of leading men astray) from conferring
with and deceiving them by means of serpents, and beasts, and birds. From what
quarter, too, did it, being a beast, obtain information regarding the injunction of God to
the man given to him alone, and in secret, not even the woman herself being aware of it?
Why also did it not prefer to make its attack upon the man instead of the woman? And if
thou sayest that it attacked her as being the weaker of the two, [I reply that], on the contrary,
she was the stronger, since she appears to have been the helper of the man in the transgression
of the commandment. For she did by herself alone resist the serpent, and it was after holding
out for a while and making opposition that she ate of the tree, being circumvented by craft;
whereas Adam, making no fight whatever, nor refusal, partook of the fruit handed to him
by the woman, which is an indication of the utmost imbecility and effeminacy of mind. And
the woman indeed, having been vanquished in the contest by a demon, is deserving of pardon;
but Adam shall deserve none, for he was worsted by a woman,—he who, in his own person,
had received the command from God. But the woman, having heard of the command from
Adam, treated it with contempt, either because she deemed it unworthy of God to speak by
means of it, or because she had her doubts, perhaps even held the opinion that the command
was given to her by Adam of his own accord. The serpent found her working alone, so that
he was enabled to confer with her apart. Observing her then either eating or not eating from
the trees, he put before her the fruit of the [forbidden] tree. And if he saw her eating, it is
manifest that she was partaker of a body subject to corruption. “For everything going in at
the mouth, is cast out into the draught.”2170 If then corruptible, it is obvious that she was
also mortal. But if mortal, then there was certainly no curse; nor was that a [condemnatory]
sentence, when the voice of God spake to the man, “For earth thou art, and unto earth shall
thou return,”2171 as the true course of things proceeds [now and always]. Then again, if the
serpent observed the woman not eating, how did he induce her to eat who never had eaten?

being a genuine production of Irenæus; and its whole style of reasoning confirms the suspicion.</note>

And who pointed out to this accursed man-slaying serpent that the sentence of death pronounced
against them by God would not take [immediate] effect, when He said, “For in the
day that ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die?” And not this merely, but that along with the
impunity2172 [attending their sin] the eyes of those should be opened who had not seen
until then? But with the opening [of their eyes] referred to, they made entrance upon the
path of death.</p>
<note type="footnote">2172 The Greek reads the barbarous word ἀθριξίᾳ, which Massuet thinks is a corruption of ἀθανασίᾳ, immortality.

be borne aloft (ἀναγωγῆς ψυχῶν) through the instrumentality of wood, upon which He
suffered who can lead those souls aloft that follow His ascension. This event was also an
indication of the fact, that when the holy soul of Christ descended [to Hades], many souls
ascended and were seen in their bodies.2196 For just as the wood, which is the lighter body,

<p>Josephus says, that when Moses had been brought up in the royal palaces, he was chosen
as general against the Ethiopians; and having proved victorious, obtained in marriage the
daughter of that king, since indeed, out of her affection for him, she delivered the city up
to him.2202</p>
<p>Why was it, that when these two (Aaron and Miriam) had both acted with despite towards
him (Moses), the latter alone was adjudged punishment?2203 First, because the woman
was the more culpable, since both nature and the law place the woman in a subordinate
condition to the man. Or perhaps it was that Aaron was to a certain degree excusable, in
consideration of his being the elder [brother], and adorned with the dignity of high priest.
Then again, inasmuch as the leper was accounted by the law unclean, while at the same time
the origin and foundation of the priesthood lay in Aaron, [the Lord] did not award a similar
punishment to him, lest this stigma should attach itself to the entire [sacerdotal] race; but
by means of his sister’s [example] He awoke his fears, and taught him the same lesson. For
Miriam’s punishment affected him to such an extent, that no sooner did she experience it,
than he entreated [Moses], who had been injured, that he would by his intercession do away
with the affliction. And he did not neglect to do so, but at once poured forth his supplication.
Upon this the Lord, who loves mankind, made him understand how He had not chastened
her as a judge, but as a father; for He said, “If her father had spit in her face, should she not
be ashamed? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her come in
again.”2204</p>

Immediately upon the surrender of this city (Saba, afterwards called Meroë) Moses married her, and returned

<p>Inasmuch2205 as certain men, impelled by what considerations I know not, remove
from God the half of His creative power, by asserting that He is merely the cause of quality
resident in matter, and by maintaining that matter itself is uncreated, come now let us put
the question, What is at any time … is immutable. Matter, then, is immutable. But if matter
be immutable, and the immutable suffers no change in regard to quality, it does not form
the substance of the world. For which reason it seems to them superfluous, that God has
annexed qualities to matter, since indeed matter admits of no possible alteration, it being
in itself an uncreated thing. But further, if matter be uncreated, it has been made altogether
according to a certain quality, and this immutable, so that it cannot be receptive of more
qualities, nor can it be the thing of which the world is made. But if the world be not made
from it, [this theory] entirely excludes God from exercising power on the creation [of the
world].</p>

<p>True2210 knowledge, then, consists in the understanding of Christ, which Paul terms
the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery, which “the natural man receiveth not,”2211 the
doctrine of the cross; of which if any man “taste,”2212 he will not accede to the disputations
and quibbles of proud and puffed-up men,2213 who go into matters of which they have no
perception.2214 For the truth is unsophisticated (ἀσχημάτιστος); and “the word is nigh thee,
in thy mouth and in thy heart,”2215 as the same apostle declares, being easy of comprehension
to those who are obedient. For it renders us like to Christ, if we experience “the power of
his resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.”2216 For this is the affinity2217 of the
apostolical teaching and the most holy “faith delivered unto us,”2218 which the unlearned
receive, and those of slender knowledge have taught, not “giving heed to endless genealogies,”
2219 but studying rather [to observe] a straightforward course of life; lest, having been
deprived of the Divine Spirit, they fail to attain to the kingdom of heaven. For truly the first
thing is to deny one’s self and to follow Christ; and those who do this are borne onward to
perfection, having fulfilled all their Teacher’s will, becoming sons of God by spiritual regeneration,
and heirs of the kingdom of heaven; those who seek which first shall not be forsaken.</p>

<p>Those who have become acquainted with the secondary (i.e., under Christ) constitutions
of the apostles,2220 are aware that the Lord instituted a new oblation in the new covenant,
according to [the declaration of] Malachi the prophet. For, “from the rising of the sun even
to the setting my name has been glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is
offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice;”2221 as John also declares in the Apocalypse: “The
incense is the prayers of the saints.”2222 Then again, Paul exhorts us “to present our bodies
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”2223 And
again, “Let us offer the sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of the lips.”2224 Now those oblations
are not according to the law, the handwriting of which the Lord took away from the midst
by cancelling it;2225 but they are according to the Spirit, for we must worship God “in spirit
and in truth.”2226 And therefore the oblation of the Eucharist is not a carnal one, but a
spiritual; and in this respect it is pure. For we make an oblation to God of the bread and the
cup of blessing, giving Him thanks in that He has commanded the earth to bring forth these
fruits for our nourishment. And then, when we have perfected the oblation, we invoke the
Holy Spirit, that He may exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread the body of Christ, and the
cup the blood of Christ, in order that the receivers of these antitypes2227 may obtain remission
of sins and life eternal. Those persons, then, who perform these oblations in remembrance
of the Lord, do not fall in with Jewish views, but, performing the service after a spiritual
manner, they shall be called sons of wisdom.</p>

<p>Now,2253 however, inasmuch as the books of these men may possibly have escaped your
observation, but have come under our notice, I call your attention to them, that for the sake
of your reputation you may expel these writings from among you, as bringing disgrace upon
you, since their author boasts himself as being one of your company. For they constitute a
stumbling-block to many, who simply and unreservedly receive, as coming from a presbyter,
the blasphemy which they utter against God. Just [consider] the writer of these things, how
by means of them he does not injure assistants [in divine service] only, who happen to be
prepared in mind for blasphemies against God, but also damages those among us, since by
his books he imbues their minds with false doctrines concerning God.</p>

<p>The2254 sacred books acknowledge with regard to Christ, that as He is the Son of man,
so is the same Being not a [mere] man; and as He is flesh, so is He also spirit, and the Word
of God, and God. And as He was born of Mary in the last times, so did He also proceed from
God as the First-begotten of every creature; and as He hungered, so did He satisfy [others];
and as He thirsted, so did He of old cause the Jews to drink, for the “Rock was Christ”2255
Himself: thus does Jesus now give to His believing people power to drink spiritual waters,
which spring up to life eternal.2256 And as He was the son of David, so was He also the Lord
of David. And as He was from Abraham, so did He also exist before Abraham.2257 And as
He was the servant of God, so is He the Son of God, and Lord of the universe. And as He
was spit upon ignominiously, so also did He breathe the Holy Spirit into His disciples.2258
And as He was saddened, so also did He give joy to His people. And as He was capable of
being handled and touched, so again did He, in a non-apprehensible form, pass through
the midst of those who sought to injure Him,2259 and entered without impediment through
closed doors.2260 And as He slept, so did He also rule the sea, the winds, and the storms.
And as He suffered, so also is He alive, and life-giving, and healing all our infirmity. And
as He died, so is He also the Resurrection of the dead. He suffered shame on earth, while
He is higher than all glory and praise in heaven; who, “though He was crucified through
weakness, yet He liveth by divine power;”2261 who “descended into the lower parts of the
earth,” and who “ascended up above the heavens;”2262 for whom a manger sufficed, yet
who filled all things; who was dead, yet who liveth for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>With2263 regard to Christ, the law and the prophets and the evangelists have proclaimed
that He was born of a virgin, that He suffered upon a beam of wood, and that He appeared
from the dead; that He also ascended to the heavens, and was glorified by the Father, and
is the Eternal King; that He is the perfect Intelligence, the Word of God, who was begotten
before the light; that He was the Founder of the universe, along with it (light), and the Maker
of man; that He is All in all: Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the laws; Chief Priest
among priests; Ruler among kings; the Prophet among prophets; the Angel among angels;
the Man among men; Son in the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. For it is He who
sailed [in the ark] along with Noah, and who guided Abraham; who was bound along with
Isaac, and was a Wanderer with Jacob; the Shepherd of those who are saved, and the
Bridegroom of the Church; the Chief also of the cherubim, the Prince of the angelic powers;

<p>The2264 law and the prophets and evangelists have declared that Christ was born of a
virgin, and suffered on the cross; was raised also from the dead, and taken up to heaven;
that He was glorified, and reigns for ever. He is Himself termed the Perfect Intellect, the
Word of God. He is the First-begotten,2265 after a transcendent manner, the Creator of man;
All in all; Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the law; the Priest among priests; among
kings Prime Leader; the Prophet among the prophets; the Angel among angels; the Man
among men; Son in the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. He was sold with Joseph,
and He guided Abraham; was bound along with Isaac, and wandered with Jacob; with Moses
He was Leader, and, respecting the people, Legislator. He preached in the prophets; was
incarnate of a virgin; born in Bethlehem; received by John, and baptized in Jordan; was
tempted in the desert, and proved to be the Lord. He gathered the apostles together, and
preached the kingdom of heaven; gave light to the blind, and raised the dead; was seen in
the temple, but was not held by the people as worthy of credit; was arrested by the priests,
conducted before Herod, and condemned in the presence of Pilate; He manifested Himself
in the body, was suspended upon a beam of wood, and raised from the dead; shown to the
apostles, and, having been carried up to heaven, sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and
has been glorified by Him as the Resurrection of the dead. Moreover, He is the Salvation of
the lost, the Light to those dwelling in darkness, and Redemption to those who have been
born; the Shepherd of the saved, and the Bridegroom of the Church; the Charioteer of the
cherubim, the Leader of the angelic host; God of God; Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

<p>“Then2266 drew near unto Him the mother of Zebedee’s children, with her sons, worshipping,
and seeking a certain thing from Him.”2267 These people are certainly not void
of understanding, nor are the words set forth in that passage of no signification: being stated
beforehand like a preface, they have some agreement with those points formerly expounded.</p>
<p>“Then drew near.” Sometimes virtue excites our admiration, not merely on account of
the display which is given of it, but also of the occasion when it was manifested. I may refer,
for example, to the premature fruit of the grape, or of the fig, or to any fruit whatsoever,
from which, during its process [of growth], no man expects maturity or full development;
yet, although any one may perceive that it is still somewhat imperfect, he does not for that
reason despise as useless the immature grape when plucked, but he gathers it with pleasure
as appearing early in the season; nor does he consider whether the grape is possessed of
perfect sweetness; nay, he at once experiences satisfaction from the thought that this one
has appeared before the rest. Just in the same way does God also, when He perceives the
faithful possessing wisdom though still imperfect, and but a small degree of faith, overlook
their defect in this respect, and therefore does not reject them; nay, but on the contrary, He
kindly welcomes and accepts them as premature fruits, and honours the mind, whatsoever
it may be, which is stamped with virtue, although not yet perfect. He makes allowance for
it, as being among the harbingers of the vintage,2268 and esteems it highly, inasmuch as,
being of a readier disposition than the rest, it has forestalled, as it were, the blessing to itself.</p>
<p>Abraham therefore, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers, are to be esteemed before all, since
they did indeed afford us such early examples of virtue. How many martyrs can be compared
to Daniel? How many martyrs, I ask, can rival the three youths in Babylon, although the
memory of the former has not been brought before us so conspicuously as that of the latter?
These were truly first-fruits, and indications of the [succeeding] fructification. Hence God
has directed their life to be recorded, as a model for those who should come after.</p>
<p>And that their virtue was thus accepted by God, as the first-fruits of the produce, hear
what He has Himself declared: “As a grape,” He says, “I have found Israel in the wilderness,
and as first-ripe figs your fathers.”2269 Call not therefore the faith of Abraham merely blessed
because he believed. Do you wish to look upon Abraham with admiration? Then behold
how that one man alone professed piety when in the world six hundred had been contam-

considers this fragment as of very doubtful authority. It commences with this heading: “From the second series

inated with error. Dost thou wish Daniel to carry thee away to amazement? Behold that
[city] Babylon, haughty in the flower and pride of impiousness, and its inhabitants completely
given over to sin of every description. But he, emerging from the depth, spat out the brine
of sins, and rejoiced to plunge into the sweet waters of piety. And now, in like manner, with
regard to that mother of Zebedee’s children, do not admire merely what she said, but also
the time at which she uttered these words. For when was it that she drew near to the Redeemer?
Not after the resurrection, nor after the preaching of His name, nor after the establishment
of His kingdom; but it was when the Lord said, “Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son
of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall kill Him, and
on the third day He shall rise again.”2270</p>
<p>These things the Saviour told in reference to His sufferings and cross; to these persons
He predicted His passion. Nor did He conceal the fact that it should be of a most ignominious
kind, at the hands of the chief priests. This woman, however, had attached another meaning
to the dispensation of His sufferings. The Saviour was foretelling death; and she asked for
the glory of immortality. The Lord was asserting that He must stand arraigned before impious
judges; but she, taking no note of that judgment, requested as of the judge: “Grant,” she
said, “that these my two sons may sit, one on the right hand, and the other on the left, in
Thy glory.” In the one case the passion is referred to, in the other the kingdom is understood.
The Saviour was speaking of the cross, while she had in view the glory which admits no
suffering. This woman, therefore, as I have already said, is worthy of our admiration, not
merely for what she sought, but also for the occasion of her making the request.</p>
<p>She did indeed suffer, not merely as a pious person, but also as a woman. For, having
been instructed by His words, she considered and believed that it would come to pass, that
the kingdom of Christ should flourish in glory, and walk in its vastness throughout the
world, and be increased by the preaching of piety. She understood, as was [in fact] the case,
that He who appeared in a lowly guise had delivered and received every promise. I will inquire
upon another occasion, when I come to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord rejected
her petition concerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same confidence would not
be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of the angels, He should be ministered to by
the angels, and receive service from the entire heavenly host. Taking the Saviour, therefore,
apart in a retired place, she earnestly desired of Him those things which transcend every
human nature.</p>

<head>Early Christian Fathers by Cyril C. Richardson</head>
<p>Part of the Library of Christian Classics series, Early Christian Fathers is the best single-book
introduction to the early church fathers, providing an enriching and informative introduction
to first and second century Christian thought. Containing carefully selected letters and
works from early church fathers--including among others St. Clement, St. Ignatius, St.
Polycarp, St. Justin the Martyr, and St. Irenaeus--Early Christian Fathers gives a representative,
though not exhaustive, overview of early Christian thought. A brief introduction and
extensive notes also accompany each letter or work, making Early Christian Fathers a great
study aid. Thus, with flowing and contemporary translations, Early Christian Fathers is ideal
for beginners and scholars alike; it is essential reading for anyone interested in the early

<head>Origen on Prayer by Origen</head>
<p>Although it was written in the late first/early second century CE, today Origen on Prayer
remains an influential text for believers on the practice, structure, and mindset of prayer.
Early church scholar and theologian Origen was born, lived, and taught in Alexandria, Egypt
and wrote several works. Origen writes that prayer is the way in which humans can know
and have discourse with God. He notes the many ways prayer is depicted in the Bible, and
then tackles the argument that prayer is superfluous. He describes the four purposes of
prayer: requests, prayers (praise), intercessions, and thanksgivings. Origen also performs
an exegesis of the Lord's Prayer, and this in-depth look at each phrase of the prayer is a
valuable resource for Christians old and new. Origen concludes with comments on the
formalities of prayer, in which he describes the proper posture and state of mind for praying.
Origen on Prayer is helpful for those who wish to know how to approach prayer and notable
for its expert discussion of the Lord's Prayer. Origen uses many Biblical references, particularly
to prayerful characters, so the text presents a number of heralded role models for our
communication with God.</p>

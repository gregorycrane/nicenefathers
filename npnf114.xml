<head>NPNF1-14. Saint Chrysostom: Homilies on the
Gospel of St. John and the Epistle to the Hebrews</head>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Chrysostom, St.
Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. The Nicene
and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts
from some of the greatest theologians of the Christian church.
These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for
over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful
even today!

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>This volume closes the American edition of the Works of St. Chrysostom, and at the
same time the First Series of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Library of the Christian Fathers.</p>
<p>The best works of St. Augustin and St. Chrysostom are thus brought within the reach
of the English reader in a more complete form and at a lower price than ever before.</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews was the last volume of the Oxford “Library of the Fathers,”
published under the direction and with a Preface of the late Dr. Pusey, the chief originator
of that valuable Library. His Preface is dated, Oxford, May, 1877. He died Sept. 16, 1882.</p>
<p>The American editor of the Homilies on the Hebrews has thoroughly revised the Oxford
translation and enlarged it with a valuable introduction on the authorship of the Epistle
(about which St. Chrysostom was mistaken), and a considerable number of explanatory
footnotes. Unfortunately he died shortly before his ms. was sent to the printer, but his son
read the proofs.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Frederic Gardiner (born Sept. 11, 1822, died July 17, 1889) was for many
years Professor in the Berkeley Episcopal Divinity School at Middletown, Conn., and President
of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis. He edited a Greek Harmony of the
Four Gospels, and several exegetical works, and was a contributor to Lange’s Commentary,
Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, and various periodicals. The revision of the
Homilies on the Epistle to the Hebrews was his last work</p>
<p>The Homilies on the Fourth Gospel appears in the Oxford “Library of the Fathers,” with
a few additional notes. The Rev. Charles Marriott (1811–1858) edited them, and wrote the
preface to the first volume. For fourteen years, from 1841 to 1855, he was associated with
Dr. Pusey as working editor, and superintended the publication of at least twenty-four
volumes (twelve of St. Chrysostom, eight of St. Augustin, four of St. Gregory I.), i.e. more
than one-half of that Library. It was with both a labor of love and sacrifice, without fee or
reward except the approval of the conscience and of good men. To their unselfish labors
the American edition owes a great debt of gratitude. Mr. Marriott did most of the literary
drudgery, as translator, corrector, and proof-reader, with untiring fidelity and painstaking
zeal till he was struck down by paralysis in 1855, “to wait in stillness for his Lord’s last call.”
Dean Burgon states these facts in a interesting account of his intimate friend (in Lives of
Twelve Good Men, London and New York, 1888, vol. I. 296–376). He calls Marriott “a
character unique, beautiful, and saint-like,” and adds that he “lived quite above the world,
and, like Enoch, walked habitually with God.”</p>
<p>I feel very thankful that this Patristic Library has so far been finished, and I am happy
to announce that the “Christian Literature Company” is sufficiently encouraged to publish
the second series, which will contain the Greek Fathers from Eusebius to John of Damascus,

<pb n="3"/>
and the Latin Fathers from Hilary to Gregory the Great. I secured the coöperation of eminent
patristic scholars of England and America several years ago for the completion of this enterprise.</p>

<head>Preface to the Homilies on the Gospel of St. John.</head>
<p>The Benedictine editor has already noticed the principal points in which these Homilies
differ from others in which St. Chrysostom comments upon Holy Scripture. They are far
more controversial than is usual with him, and the part devoted to moral exhortation is
shorter. This may be partly owing to the number of passages in St. John which bear on the
doctrine of our Lord’s Person and His Divine and Human Natures. But it seems further that
they were delivered to a select audience at an early hour of the day. For toward the latter
part of Hom. XXXI. he contrasts the coolness of the morning, in which they were assembled,
with the mid-day heat, in which the woman of Samaria listened to our Lord. And the character
of the instruction given almost unquestionably marks the hearers as having been less
miscellaneous, and less liable to be supposed wanting in points of common duty, than those
whom he generally addressed.</p>
<p>They do not give their own date, but are referred to by the Author, while still at Antioch,
as already published, in Hom. VII. on 1 Cor. ii. 8. “However, the manner of this way of
knowledge and of that hath already been declared in the Gospel; and, not to be continually
handling the same topic, thither do we refer our readers.” The place is St. John viii. 19 treated
in Hom. XLIX.</p>
<p>And since the three first years after St. Chrysostom was ordained Priest, A.D. 386–8,
seem completely filled up, and the Homilies in St. Matthew were probably prior to these, it
is most likely that they were not begun before A.D. 390, while those on some of the Epistles
of St. Paul seem to have come after them, and still before the year 398, in which he was removed
to Constantinople.</p>
<p>In either city there were numerous heretics of the sect against which he is most careful
to supply arguments, the Anomoeans, who held that the Son is not even of like <del>much less
of the same</del> substance with the Father. And even in his less generally controversial works,
we often meet with discussions of their tenets. But in these Homilies he is continually
meeting with texts which they perverted to the maintenance of their heresy, and turning
them into weapons for its confutation. And this he usually does with great success, since
the Catholic doctrine of the true and perfect Godhead, united in One Person with true and
perfect Manhood, affords a key that easily opens texts which most stubbornly resist any
confused notion of an inferior Divinity, or an unreal Humanity. The texts urged by the
heretic, put to this test, are found not really to belong to him. They are not even arguments
so far for his view of the case, but perfectly consistent with the truth always held by the
Church. There may remain a few cases, after attentive study, in which it is difficult to be
sure what is the exact meaning, or even whether a given text speaks of the Godhead or of
the Manhood, but as to the general doctrine of the whole Scripture, or the consistency of

<pb n="10"/>
that doctrine with any and every text therein contained, there is no reasonable doubt. There
are those whose faith seems to tremble on the balance when such a passage of Scripture is
under discussion, but this must be either from an inveterate habit of doubting, or an imperfect
apprehension of the real meaning of the Catholic doctrine. The most skillful commentator
may occasionally fall into a critical error, but no one who has ever fully entered into the
sense of Holy Scripture will dream of the alternative being between such and such an exposition
and the acceptance of heresy. Enough is clear to make us very sure what will be the
doctrine of any difficult passage, though we may be in doubt of its interpretation. St.
Chrysostom is usually right, and not only so, but most ingenious in detecting the rhetorical
connection of sentiments and arguments. If anywhere he fails, it is from some over-refinement
in rhetorical analysis, and not from any want of apprehension of the main truths
concerned.</p>
<p>In the first volume of the Benedictine edition there is a series of Homilies against the
Anomoeans, in the first of which he states that he had been unwilling for some time to enter
on the controversy, for fear of driving away hearers who held those opinions, but that he
had now taken it up at their earnest request. These Homilies were delivered some time before
those on St. John, beginning in the first year after his ordination with those “On the Incomprehensible
Nature of God,” in opposition to the pretensions of that sect to the perfect
knowledge of Divine things. And the Benedictine Editor refers to them as containing a more
complete array of the positive evidence of St. John to the Catholic doctrines than even this
commentary affords.</p>
<p>The history of the woman taken in adultery is omitted in this commentary, and the
Benedictine editor was not able to trace it in any of the works of St. Chrysostom. It is suggested
that his copies may have wanted the passage, or that he may have omitted it for fear
it should be taken as an encouragement to vice. But he was not the man to shrink from so
slight a difficulty, nor would he have failed, in commenting on it, to leave an impression on
the hearer by no means calculated to lessen his dread of sin. Such a reason may have prevailed
with some copyists to suppress the passage, and it is probable that it was not found in the
copy which he used. It is omitted in like manner by St. Cyril of Alexandria.1</p>
<note type="footnote">1 [The pericope John vii. 53–viii. 11 is considered by the best modern critics as an interpolation by a transcriber,
but is probably based on a genuine apostolic tradition, perhaps taken from the lost work of Papias of Hierapolis,
who collected from primitive disciples various discourses of our Lord, among others “a narrative concerning a
woman maliciously accused before the Lord touching many sins.” (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. III. 39.) The section is
omitted in the oldest uncial and other Greek mss. (􀀀, B, etc.); it was unknown to Chrysostom and other Greek
and early Latin fathers; it interrupts the context; it departs from the style of John, and presents an unusual
number of various readings. We find it first in Latin Gospel mss. of the fourth century, but in different places,
sometimes at the end of the Gospel of John as an appendix, sometimes at the end of Luke xxi. It was also in the
Gospel according to the Hebrews. The R.V. properly retains it, but in brackets and with a marginal note. The</note>

<p>The text of Savile has been followed, except where the Benedictine edition has supplied
improvements. The Benedictine sections are numbered throughout: where the division
seemed to be inconvenient, the number is given in the margin. In the earlier Homilies a
second series of numbers is employed to mark the sections in the translation; this was discontinued
as unnecessary, and the Benedictine only retained. In some of the references to
the Psalms, where the Septuagint differs much from the Hebrew, the numbers given are
those of the Greek. Care will be taken in the Index of Texts to give always the reference to
the Psalm and Verse according to the Hebrew reckoning followed in our own Version.</p>
<p>The editors are indebted for the present translation to the Rev. G. T. Stupart, M.A., late
Fellow of Exeter College. It has been kindly carried through the Press by the Rev . J. G.
Hickley, B.D., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. The translation of the remaining Homilies
is completed, and will shortly be in the Press.2</p>

HOMILIES OF ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM,
ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE,
ON THE
GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
ST. JOHN.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>Preface.</p>
<p><del>1.</del> They that are spectators of the heathen games, when they have learned that a distinguished
athlete and winner of crowns is come from any quarter, run all together to view his
wrestling, and all his skill and strength; and you may see the whole theater of many ten
thousands, all there straining their eyes both of body and mind, that nothing of what is done
may escape them. So again these same persons, if any admirable musician come amongst
them, leave all that they had in hand, which often is necessary and pressing business, and
mount the steps, and sit listening very attentively to the words and the accompaniments,
and criticising the agreement of the two. This is what the many do.</p>
<p>Again; those who are skilled in rhetoric do just the same with respect to the sophists,
for they too have their theaters, and their audience, and clappings of hands, and noise, and
closest criticism of what is said.</p>
<p>And if in the case of rhetoricians, musicians, and athletes, people sit in the one case to
look on, in the other to see at once and to listen with such earnest attention; what zeal, what
earnestness ought ye in reason to display, when it is no musician or debater who now comes
forward to a trial of skill, but when a man is speaking from heaven, and utters a voice
plainer than thunder? for he has pervaded the whole earth with the sound; and occupied
and filled it, not by the loudness of the cry, but by moving his tongue with the grace of God.</p>

<pb n="13"/>
<p>And what is wonderful, this sound, great as it is, is neither a harsh nor an unpleasant
one, but sweeter and more delightful than all harmony of music, and with more skill to
soothe; and besides all this, most holy, and most awful, and full of mysteries so great, and
bringing with it goods so great, that if men were exactly and with ready mind to receive and
keep them, they could no longer be mere men nor remain upon the earth, but would take
their stand above all the things of this life, and having adapted themselves to the condition
of angels, would dwell on earth just as if it were heaven.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For the son of thunder, the beloved of Christ, the pillar of the Churches throughout
the world, who holds the keys of heaven, who drank the cup of Christ, and was baptized
with His baptism, who lay upon his Master’s bosom with much confidence,3 this man comes
forward to us now; not as an actor of a play, not hiding his head with a mask, (for he hath
another sort of words to speak,) nor mounting a platform,4 nor striking the stage with his
foot, nor dressed out with apparel of gold, but he enters wearing a robe of inconceivable
beauty. For he will appear before us having “put on Christ” ( Rom. xiii. 14; Gal. iii. 27 ),
having his beautiful “feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace” ( Eph. vi. 15 );
wearing a girdle not about his waist, but about his loins, not made of scarlet leather nor
daubed outside5 with gold, but woven and composed of truth itself. Now will he appear
before us, not acting a part, (for with him there is nothing counterfeit, nor fiction, nor fable,)
but with unmasked head he proclaims to us the truth unmasked; not making the audience
believe him other than he is by carriage, by look, by voice, needing for the delivery of his
message no instruments of music, as harp, lyre, or any other the like, for he effects all with
his tongue, uttering a voice which is sweeter and more profitable than that of any harper or
any music. All heaven is his stage; his theater, the habitable world; his audience, all angels;
and of men as many as are angels already, or desire to become so, for none but these can
hear that harmony aright, and show it forth by their works; all the rest, like little children
who hear, but what they hear understand not, from their anxiety about sweetmeats and
childish playthings; so they too, being in mirth and luxury, and living only for wealth and
power and sensuality, hear sometimes what is said, it is true, but show forth nothing great
or noble in their actions through fastening6 themselves for good to the clay of the brickmaking.
By this Apostle stand the powers from above, marveling at the beauty of his soul, and
his understanding, and the bloom of that virtue by which he drew unto him Christ Himself,
and obtained the grace of the Spirit. For he hath made ready his soul, as some well-fashioned

and jeweled lyre with strings of gold, and yielded it for the utterance of something great and
sublime to the Spirit.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Seeing then it is no longer the fisherman the son of Zebedee, but He who knoweth
“the deep things of God” ( 1 Cor. ii. 10 ), the Holy Spirit I mean, that striketh this lyre, let
us hearken accordingly. For he will say nothing to us as a man, but what he saith, he will
say from the depths of the Spirit, from those secret things which before they came to pass
the very Angels knew not; since they too have learned by the voice of John with us, and by
us, the things which we know. And this hath another Apostle declared, saying, “To the intent
that unto the principalities and powers might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom
of God.” ( Eph. iii. 10.) If then principalities, and powers, and Cherubim, and Seraphim,
learned these things by the Church, it is very clear that they were exceedingly earnest in
listening to this teaching; and even in this we have been not a little honored, that the Angels
learned things which before they knew not with us; I do not at present speak of their learning
by us also. Let us then show much silence and orderly behavior; not to-day only, nor during
the day on which we are hearers, but during all our life, since it is at all times good to hear
Him. For if we long to know what is going on in the palace, what, for instance, the king has
said, what he has done, what counsel he is taking concerning his subjects, though in truth
these things are for the most part nothing to us; much more is it desirable to hear what God
hath said, especially when all concerns us. And all this will this man tell us exactly, as being
a friend of the King Himself, or rather, as having Him speaking within himself, and from
Him hearing all things which He heareth from the Father. “I have called you friends,” He
saith, “for all things that I have heard of My Father, I have made known unto you.” ( John
xv. 15.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> As then we should all run together if we saw one from above bend down “on a
sudden”7 from the height of heaven, promising to describe exactly all things there, even so
let us be disposed now. It is from thence that this Man speaketh to us; He is not of this world,
as Christ Himself declareth, “Ye are not of the world” ( John xv. 19 ), and He hath speaking
within him the Comforter, the Omnipresent, who knoweth the things of God as exactly as
the soul of man knoweth what belongs to herself, the Spirit of holiness, the righteous Spirit,
the guiding Spirit, which leads men by the hand to heaven, which gives them other eyes,
fitting them to see things to come as though present, and giving them even in the flesh to
look into things heavenly. To Him then let us yield ourselves during all our life8 in much
tranquillity. Let none dull, none sleepy, none sordid, enter here and tarry; but let us remove
ourselves to heaven, for there He speaketh these things to those who are citizens there. And
if we tarry on earth, we shall gain nothing great from thence. For the words of John are
<note type="footnote">7 ἄ θροον, comp. Eus. Hist. Eccl. v. i. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">8 πολλὴν παρέχωμεν τὴν ἡσυχίαν.</note>

<pb n="15"/>
nothing to those who do not desire to be freed from this swinish life, just as the things of
this world to him are nothing. The thunder amazes our souls, having sound without significance;
9 but this man’s voice troubles none of the faithful, yea, rather releases them from
trouble and confusion; it amazes the devils only, and those who are their slaves. Therefore
that we may know how it amazes them, let us preserve deep silence, both external and
mental, but especially the latter; for what advantage is it that the mouth be hushed, if the
soul is disturbed and full of tossing? I look for that calm which is of the mind, of the soul,
since it is the hearing of the soul which I require. Let then no desire of riches trouble us, no
lust of glory, no tyranny of anger, nor the crowd of other passions besides these; for it is not
possible for the ear, except it be cleansed, to perceive as it ought the sublimity of the things
spoken; nor rightly to understand the awful and unutterable nature of these mysteries, and
all other virtue which is in these divine oracles. If a man cannot learn well a melody on pipe
or harp, unless he in every way strain his attention; how shall one, who sits as a listener to
sounds mystical, be able to hear with a careless soul?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Wherefore Christ Himself exhorted, saying, “Give not that which is holy unto the
dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.” ( Matt. vii. 6.) He called these words “pearls,”
though in truth they be much more precious than they, because we have no substance more
precious than that. For this reason too He is wont often to compare their sweetness to honey,
not that so much only is the measure of their sweetness, but because amongst us there is
nothing sweeter. Now, to show that they very exceedingly surpass the nature of precious
stones, and the sweetness of any honey, hear the prophet speaking concerning them, and
declaring this superiority; “More to be desired are they,” he saith “than gold and much
precious stone; sweeter are they also than honey and the honeycomb.” ( Ps. xix. 10.) But to
those (only) who are in health; wherefore he has added, “For thy servant keepeth them.”
And again in another place calling them sweet he has added, “to my throat.” For he saith,
“How sweet are thy words unto my throat.” ( Ps. cxix. 103.) And again he insisteth on the
superiority, saying, “Above honey and the honeycomb to my mouth.” For he was in very
sound health. And let not us either come nigh to these while we are sick, but when we have
healed our soul, so receive the food that is offered us.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that, after so long a preface, I have not yet attempted to fathom10
these expressions (of St. John), in order that every one having laid aside all manner of infirmity,
as though he were entering into heaven itself, so may enter here pure, and freed
from wrath and carefulness and anxiety of this life, of all other passions. For it is not otherwise
possible for a man to gain from hence anything great, except he have first so cleansed anew
his soul. And let no one say that the time to the coming communion11 is short, for it is
<note type="footnote">9 ἄ σημον.</note>
<note type="footnote">10 καθῆκα.</note>
<note type="footnote">11 συνάξεως.</note>

<pb n="16"/>
possible, not only in five days, but in one moment, to change the whole course of life. Tell
me what is worse than a robber and a murderer, is not this the extremest kind of wickedness?
Yet such an one arrived straight at the summit of excellence, and passed into Paradise itself,
not needing days, nor half a day, but one little moment. So that a man may change suddenly,
and become gold instead of clay. For since what belongs to virtue and to vice is not by nature,
the change is easy, as being independent of any necessity. “If ye be willing and obedient,”
He saith, “ye shall eat the good of the land.” ( Isa. i. 19.) Seest thou that there needs the will
only? will—not the common wishing of the multitude—but earnest will. For I know that
all are wishing to fly up to heaven even now; but it is necessary to show forth the wish by
works. The merchant too wishes to get rich; but he doth not allow his wish to stop with the
thought of it; no, he fits out a ship, and gets together sailors, and engages a pilot, and furnishes
the vessel with all other stores, and borrows money, and crosses the sea, and goes away into
a strange land, and endures many dangers, and all the rest which they know who sail the
sea. So too must we show our will; for we also sail a voyage, not from land to land, but from
earth to heaven. Let us then so order our reason, that it be serviceable to steer our upward
course, and our sailors that they be obedient to it, and let our vessel be stout, that it be not
swamped amidst the reverses and despondencies of this life, nor be lifted up by the blasts
of vainglory, but be a fast and easy vessel. If so we order our ship, and so our pilot and our
crew, we shall sail with a fair wind, and we shall draw down to ourselves the Son of God,
the true Pilot, who will not leave our bark to be engulfed, but, though ten thousand winds
may blow, will rebuke the winds and the sea, and instead of raging waves, make a great calm.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Having therefore ordered yourselves, so come to our next assembly, if at least it be
at all an object of desire to you to hear somewhat to your advantage, and lay up what is said
in your souls. But let not one of you be the “wayside,” none the “stony ground,” none the
“full of thorns.” ( Matt. xiii. 4, 5, 7.) Let us make ourselves fallow lands. For so shall we (the
preachers) put in the seed with gladness, when we see the land clean, but if stony or rough,
pardon us if we like not to labor in vain. For if we shall leave off sowing and begin to cut up
thorns, surely to cast seed into ground unwrought were extreme folly.</p>
<p>It is not meet that he who has the advantage of such hearing be partaker of the table of
devils. “For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?” ( 2 Cor. vi. 14.) Thou
standest listening to John, and learning the things of the Spirit by him; and dost thou after
this depart to listen to harlots speaking vile things, and acting viler, and to effeminates
cuffing one another? How wilt thou be able to be fairly cleansed, if thou wallowest in such
mire? Why need I reckon in detail all the indecency that is there? All there is laughter, all
is shame, all disgrace, revilings and mockings, all abandonment, all destruction. See, I forewarn
and charge you all. Let none of those who enjoy the blessings of this table destroy his

<pb n="17"/>
own soul by those pernicious spectacles. All that is said and done there is a pageant of Satan.
But ye who have been initiated know what manner of covenants ye made with us, or rather
ye made with Christ when He guided you into His mysteries, what ye spoke to Him, what
speech ye had with Him concerning Satan’s pageant;12 how with Satan and his angels ye
renounced this also, and promised that you would not so much as cast a glance13 that way.
There is then no slight ground for fear, lest, by becoming careless of such promises, one
should render himself unworthy of these mysteries.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Seest thou not how in king’s palaces it is not those who have offended, but those
who have been honorably distinguished,14 that are called to share especial favor,15 and are
numbered among the king’s friends. A messenger has come to us from heaven, sent by God
Himself, to speak with us on certain necessary matters, and you leave hearing His will, and
the message He sends to you, and sit listening to stage-players. What thunderings, what
bolts from heaven, does not this conduct deserve! For as it is not meet to partake of the table
of devils, so neither is it of the listening to devils; nor to be present with filthy raiment at
that glorious Table, loaded with so many good things, which God Himself hath provided.
Such is its power, that it can raise us at once to heaven, if only we approach it with a sober
mind. For it is not possible that he who is continually under the influence of16 the words
of God, can remain in this present low condition, but he needs must presently take wing,
and fly away to the land which is above, and light on the infinite treasures of good things;
which may it be that we all attain to, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom and with whom be glory to the Father and the All-holy Spirit, now
and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 1</p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word.”</p>
<p>Were John about to converse with us, and to say to us words of his own, we needs must
describe his family, his country, and his education. But since it is not he, but God by him,
that speaks to mankind, it seems to me superfluous and distracting to enquire into these
matters. And yet even thus it is not superfluous, but even very necessary. For when you have
learned who he was, and from whence, who his parents, and what his character, and then
hear his voice and all his heavenly wisdom,17 then you shall know right well that these
(doctrines) belong not to him, but to the Divine power stirring his soul.</p>
<p>From what country18 then was he? From no country; but from a poor village, and from
a land little esteemed, and producing no good thing. For the Scribes speak evil of Galilee,
saying, “Search and look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” ( John vii. 52.) And “the
Israelite indeed” speaks ill of it, saying, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” And
being of this land, he was not even of any remarkable place in it, but of one not even distinguished
by name. Of this he was,19 and his father a poor fisherman, so poor that he took
his sons to the same employment. Now you all know that no workman will choose to bring
up his son to succeed him in his trade, unless poverty press him very hard, especially where
the trade is a mean one. But nothing can be poorer, meaner, no, nor more ignorant, than
fishermen. Yet even among them there are some greater, some less; and even there our
Apostle occupied the lower rank, for he did not take his prey from the sea, but passed his
time on a certain little lake. And as he was engaged by it with his father and his brother
James, and they mending their broken nets, a thing which of itself marked extreme poverty,
so Christ called him.20</p>
<p>As for worldly instruction, we may learn from these facts that he had none at all of it.
Besides, Luke testifies this when he writes not only that he was ignorant,21 but that he was
<note type="footnote">17 φιλοσοφίας.</note>

<note type="footnote">19 One ms. “not even distinguished by name had he not been of it. His,” U+0026c. </note>
<note type="footnote">20 [On the other hand, the facts that John’s father Zebedee had hired servants, that his mother Salome aided
in the support of Jesus, that John was acquainted with the high-priest, and seems to have possessed a home in
Jerusalem into which he took the mother of our Saviour after the crucifixion, prove that he was not the poorest
among the fishermen, but in tolerably good circumstances. Comp. Mark ii. 20; Luke v. 10; viii. 3; Mark xvi. 1;

absolutely unlettered.22 ( Acts iv. 13.) As was likely. For one who was so poor, never coming
into the public assemblies, nor falling in with men of respectability, but as it were nailed to
his fishing, or even if he ever did meet any one, conversing with fishmongers and cooks,
how, I say, was he likely to be in a state better than that of the irrational animals? how could
he help imitating the very dumbness of his fishes?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> This fisherman then, whose business was about lakes, and nets, and fish; this native
of Bethsaida of Galilee; this son of a poor fisherman, yes, and poor to the last degree; this
man ignorant, and to the last degree of ignorance too, who never learned letters either before
or after he accompanied Christ; let us see what he utters, and on what matters he converses
with us. Is it of things in the field? Is it of things in rivers? On the trade in fish? For these
things, perhaps, one expects to hear from a fisherman. But fear ye not; we shall hear nought
of these; but we shall hear of things in heaven, and what no one ever learned before this
man. For, as might be expected of one who speaks from the very treasures of the Spirit, he
is come bringing to us sublime doctrines, and the best way of life and wisdom, <del>as though
just arrived from the very heavens; yea, rather such as it was not likely that all even there
should know, as I said before.23</del> Do these things belong to a fisherman? Tell me. Do they
belong to a rhetorician at all? To a sophist or philosopher? To every one trained in the wisdom
of the Gentiles? By no means. The human soul is simply unable thus to philosophize on that
pure and blessed nature; on the powers that come next to it; on immortality and endless
life; on the nature of mortal bodies which shall hereafter be immortal; on punishment and
the judgment to come; on the enquiries that shall be as to deeds and words, as to thoughts
and imaginations. It cannot tell what is man, what the world; what is man indeed, and what
he who seems to be man, but is not; what is the nature of virtue, what of vice.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Some of these things indeed the disciples of Plato and Pythagoras enquired into.
Of the other philosophers we need make no mention at all; they have all on this point been
so excessively ridiculous; and those who have been among them in greater esteem than the
rest, and who have been considered the leading men in this science, are so more than the
others; and they have composed and written somewhat on the subject of polity and doctrines,
and in all have been more shamefully ridiculous than children. For they have spent their
whole life in making women common to all, in overthrowing the very order of life,24 in
doing away the honor of marriage, and in making other the like ridiculous laws. As for
doctrines on the soul, there is nothing excessively shameful that they have left unsaid; assert-

ing that the souls of men become flies, and gnats, and bushes,25 and that God Himself is a
soul; with some other the like indecencies.</p>
<p>And not this alone in them is worthy of blame, but so is also their ever-shifting current
of words; for since they assert everything on uncertain and fallacious arguments, they are
like men carried hither and thither in Euripus, and never remain in the same place.</p>
<p>Not so this fisherman; for all he saith is infallible; and standing as it were upon a rock,
he never shifts his ground. For since he has been thought worthy to be in the most secret
places, and has the Lord of all speaking within him, he is subject to nothing that is human.
But they, like persons who are not held worthy even in a dream26 to set foot in the king’s
palace, but who pass their time in the forum with other men, guessing from their own
imagination at what they cannot see, have erred a great error, and, like blind or drunken
men in their wandering, have dashed against each other; and not only against each other,
but against themselves, by continually changing their opinion, and that ever on the same
matters.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But this unlettered man, the ignorant, the native of Bethsaida, the son of Zebedee,
(though the Greeks mock ten thousand times at the rusticity of the names, I shall not the
less speak them with the greater boldness.) For the more barbarous his nation seems to
them, and the more he seems removed from Grecian discipline, so much the brighter does
what we have with us appear. For when a barbarian and an untaught person utters things
which no man on earth ever knew, and does not only utter, (though if this were the only
thing it were a great marvel,) but besides this, affords another and a stronger proof that what
he says is divinely inspired, namely, the convincing all his hearers through all time; who
will not wonder at the power that dwells in him? Since this is, as I said, the strongest proof
that he lays down no laws of his own. This barbarian then, with his writing of the Gospel,
has occupied all the habitable world. With his body he has taken possession of the center
of Asia, where of old philosophized all of the Grecian party, shining forth in the midst of
his foes, dispersing27 their darkness, and breaking down the stronghold of devils: but in
soul he has retired to that place which is fit for one who has done such things.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And as for the writings of the Greeks, they are all put out and vanished, but this
man’s shine brighter day by day. For from the time that he (was) and the other fishermen,
since then the (doctrines) of Pythagoras and of Plato, which seemed before to prevail, have
ceased to be spoken of, and most men do not know them even by name. Yet Plato was, they
say, the invited companion of kings, had many friends, and sailed to Sicily. And Pythagoras
<note type="footnote">25 Empedocles said this. Vid. Diog. Laert. viii. 2. ῎ Ηδη γάρ ποτ̓ ἐγὼ γενόμην κοῦρός τε κόρη τε Θάμνος τ̓

occupied Magna Græcia,28 and practiced there ten thousand kinds of sorcery. For to converse
with oxen, (which they say he did,) was nothing else but a piece of sorcery. As is most clear
from this. He that so conversed with brutes did not in anything benefit the race of men, but
even did them the greatest wrong. Yet surely, the nature of men was better adapted for the
reasoning of philosophy; still he did, as they say, converse with eagles and oxen, using sorceries.
For he did not make their irrational nature rational, (this was impossible to man,)
but by his magic tricks he deceived the foolish. And neglecting to teach men anything useful,
he taught that they might as well eat the heads of those who begot them, as beans. And he
persuaded those who associated with him, that the soul of their teacher had actually been
at one time a bush, at another a girl, at another a fish.</p>
<p>Are not these things with good cause extinct, and vanished utterly? With good cause,
and reasonably. But not so the words of him who was ignorant and unlettered; for Syrians,
and Egyptians, and Indians, and Persians, and Ethiopians, and ten thousand other nations,
translating into their own tongues the doctrines introduced by him, barbarians though they
be, have learned to philosophize. I did not therefore idly say that all the world has become
his theater. For he did not leave those of his own kind, and waste his labor on the irrational
creatures, (an act of excessive vainglory and extreme folly,) but being clear of this as well as
of other passions, he was earnest on one point only, that all the world might learn somewhat
of the things which might profit it, and be able to translate it from earth to heaven.</p>
<p>For this reason too, he did not hide his teaching in mist and darkness, as they did who
threw obscurity of speech, like a kind of veil, around the mischiefs laid up within. But this
man’s doctrines are clearer than the sunbeams, wherefore they have been unfolded29 to all
men throughout the world. For he did not teach as Pythagoras did, commanding those who
came to him to be silent for five years, or to sit like senseless stones; neither did he invent
fables defining the universe to consist of numbers; but casting away all this devilish trash
and mischief, he diffused such simplicity through his words, that all he said was plain, not
only to wise men, but also to women and youths. For he was persuaded that the words were
true and profitable to all that should hearken to them. And all time after him is his witness;
since he has drawn to him all the world, and has freed our life when we have listened to
these words from all monstrous display of wisdom; wherefore we who hear them would
prefer rather to give up our lives, than the doctrines by him delivered to us.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> From this then, and from every other circumstance, it is plain, that nothing of this
man’s is human, but divine and heavenly are the lessons which come to us by this divine
soul. For we shall observe not sounding sentences, nor magnificent diction, nor excessive
and useless order and arrangement of words and sentences, (these things are far from all
<note type="footnote">28 τὴν μεγίστην ῞Ελλαδα.</note>
<note type="footnote">29 ἀ νήπλωται.</note>

<pb n="22"/>
true wisdom,) but strength invincible and divine, and irresistible force of right doctrines,
and a rich supply of unnumbered good things. For their over-care about expression was so
excessive, so worthy of mere sophists, or rather not even of sophists, but of silly striplings,
that even their own chief philosopher introduces his own master as greatly ashamed of this
art, and as saying to the judges, that what they hear from him shall be spoken plainly and
without premeditation, not tricked out rhetorically nor ornamented with (fine) sentences
and words; since, says he, it cannot surely be becoming, O men, that one at my age should
come before you like a lad inventing speeches.30 And observe the extreme absurdity of the
thing; what he has described his master avoiding as disgraceful, unworthy of philosophy
and work for lads, this above all he himself has cultivated. So entirely were they given up to
mere love of distinction.</p>
<p>And as, if you uncover those sepulchers which are whitened without you will find them
full of corruption, and stench, and rotten bones; so too the doctrines of the philosopher, if
you strip them of their flowery diction, you will see to be full of much abomination, especially
when he philosophizes on the soul, which he both honors and speaks ill of without measure.
And this is the snare of the devil, never to keep due proportion, but by excess on either hand
to lead aside those who are entangled by it into evil speaking. At one time he says, that the
soul is of the substance of God; at another, after having exalted it thus immoderately and
impiously, he exceeds again in a different way, and treats it with insult, making it pass into
swine and asses, and other animals of yet less esteem than these.</p>
<p>But enough of this; or rather even this is out of measure. For if it were possible to learn
anything profitable from these things, we must have been longer occupied with them; but
if it be only to observe their indecency and absurdity, more than requisite has been said by
us already. We will therefore leave their fables, and attach ourselves to our own doctrines,
which have been brought to us from above by the tongue of this fisherman, and which have
nothing human in them.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us then bring forward the words, having reminded you now, as I exhorted you
at the first, earnestly to attend to what is said. What then does this Evangelist say immediately
on his outset?</p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” ( Ver. 1.) Seest thou the
great boldness and power of the words, how he speaks nothing doubting nor conjecturing,
but declaring all things plainly? For this is the teacher’s part, not to waver in anything he
says, since if he who is to be a guide to the rest require another person who shall be able to
establish him with certainty, he would be rightly ranked not among teachers, but among
disciples.</p>
<note type="footnote">30 Plat. Apol. Socr. § 1, in init.</note>

<pb n="23"/>
<p>But if any one say, “What can be the reason that he has neglected the first cause, and
spoken to us at once concerning the second?” we shall decline to speak of “first” and “second,”
for the Divinity is above number, and the succession of times. Wherefore we decline these
expressions; but we confess that the Father is from none, and that the Son is begotten of the
Father. Yes, it may be said, but why then does he leave the Father, and speak concerning
the Son? Why? because the former was manifest to all, if not as Father, at least as God; but
the Only-Begotten was not known; and therefore with reason did he immediately from the
very beginning hasten to implant the knowledge of Him in those who knew Him not.</p>
<p>Besides, he has not been silent as to the Father in his writings on these points. And observe,
I beg of you, his spiritual wisdom. He knows that men most honor the eldest of beings
which was before all, and account this to be God. Wherefore from this point first he makes
his beginning, and as he advances, declares that God is, and does not like Plato assert,
sometimes that He is intellect, sometimes that He is soul; for these things are far removed
from that divine and unmixed Nature which has nothing common with us, but is separated
from any fellowship with created things, I mean as to substance, though not as to relation.</p>
<p>And for this reason he calls Him “The Word.” For since he is about to teach that this
“Word” is the only-begotten Son of God, in order that no one may imagine that His generation
is passible, by giving Him the appellation of “The Word,” he anticipates and removes
beforehand the evil suspicion, showing that the Son is from the Father, and that without
His suffering (change).</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Seest thou then that as I said, he has not been silent as to the Father in his words
concerning the Son? And if these instances are not sufficient fully to explain the whole
matter, marvel not, for our argument is God, whom it is impossible to describe, or to imagine
worthily; hence this man nowhere assigns the name of His essence, (for it is not possible to
say what God is, as to essence,) but everywhere he declares Him to us by His workings. For
this “Word” one may see shortly after called “Light,” and the “Light” in turn named “Life.”</p>
<p>Although not for this reason only did he so name Him; this was the first reason, and
the second was because He was about to declare to us the things of the Father. For “all
things,” He saith, “that I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.” ( John
xv. 15.) He calls Him both “Light” and “Life,” for He hath freely given to us the light which
proceeds from knowledge, and the life which follows it. In short, one name is not sufficient,
nor two, nor three, nor more, to teach us what belongs to God. But we must be content to
be able even by means of many to apprehend, though but obscurely, His attributes.</p>
<p>And he has not called Him simply “Word,” but with the addition of the article, distinguishing
Him from the rest in this way also. Seest thou then that I said not without cause
that this Evangelist speaks to us from heaven? Only see from the very beginning whither he
has drawn up the soul, having given it wings, and has carried up with him the mind of his
hearers. For having set it higher than all the things of sense, than earth, than sea, than

<pb n="24"/>
heaven, he leads it by the hand above the very angels, above cherubim and seraphim, above
thrones and principalities and powers; in a word, persuades it to journey beyond all created
things.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> What then? when he has brought us to such a height as this, is he in sooth able to
stop us there? By no means; but just as one by transporting into the midst of the sea a person
who was standing on the beach, and looking on cities, and beaches, and havens, removes
him indeed from the former objects, yet does not stay his sight anywhere, but brings him
to a view without bound; so this Evangelist, having brought us above all creation, and escorted
us towards the eternal periods which lie beyond it, leaves the sight suspended,31 not allowing
it to arrive at any limit upwards, as indeed there is none.</p>
<p>For the intellect, having ascended to “the beginning,” enquires what “beginning”; and
then finding the “was” always outstripping its imagination, has no point at which to stay its
thought; but looking intently onwards, and being unable to cease at any point, it becomes
wearied out, and turns back to things below. For this “was in the beginning,” is nothing else
than expressive of ever being and being infinitely.</p>
<p>Seest thou true philosophy and divine doctrines? Not like those of the Greeks, who assign
times, and say that some indeed of the gods are younger, some elder. There is nothing of
this with us. For if God Is, as certainly He Is, then nothing was before Him. If He is Creator
of all things, He must be first; if Master and Lord of all, then all, both creatures and ages,
are after Him.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> I had desired to enter the lists yet on other difficulties, but perhaps our minds are
wearied out; when therefore I have advised you on those points which are useful32 to us for
the hearing, both of what has been said, and of what is yet to be said, I again will hold my
peace. What then are these points? I know that many have become confused33 by reason of
the length of what has been spoken. Now this takes place when the soul is heavy laden with
many burdens of this life. For as the eye when it is clear and transparent is keen-sighted
also, and will not easily be tired in making out even the minutest bodies; but when from
some bad humor from the head having poured into it, or some smoke-like fumes having
ascended to it from beneath, a kind of thick cloud is formed before the ball, this does not
allow it clearly to perceive even any larger object; so is naturally the case with the soul. For
when it is purified, and has no passion to disturb it, it looks steadfastly to the fit objects of
its regard; but when, darkened by many passions, it loses its proper excellence, then it is not
easily able to be sufficient for any high thing, but soon is wearied, and falls back; and turning

<note type="footnote">33 ἴ λιγγιάσαντας.</note>

<pb n="25"/>
aside to sleep and sloth, lets pass things that concern it with a view to excellence and the life
thence arising, instead of receiving them with much readiness.</p>
<p>And that you may not suffer this, (I shall not cease continually thus to warn you,)
strengthen your minds, that ye may not hear what the faithful among the Hebrews heard
from Paul. For to them he said that he had “many things to say, and hard to be uttered” (
Heb. v. 11 ); not as though they were by nature such, but because, says he, “ye are dull of
hearing.” For it is the nature of the weak and infirm man to be confused even by few words
as by many, and what is clear and easy he thinks hard to be comprehended. Let not any here
be such an one, but having chased from him all worldly care, so let him hear these doctrines.</p>
<p>For when the desire of money possesses the hearer, the desire of hearing cannot possess
him as well; since the soul, being one, cannot suffice for many desires; but one of the two is
injured by the other, and, from division, becomes weaker as its rival prevails, and expends
all upon itself.</p>
<p>And this is wont to happen in the case of children. When a man has only one, he loves
that one exceedingly. But when he has become father of many, then also his dispositions of
affection being divided become weaker.</p>
<p>If this happens where there is the absolute rule and power of nature, and the objects
beloved are akin one with another, what can we say as to that desire and disposition which
is according to deliberate choice; especially where these desires lie directly opposed to each
other; for the love of wealth is a thing opposed to the love of this kind of hearing. We enter
heaven when we enter here; not in place, I mean, but in disposition; for it is possible for one
who is on earth to stand in heaven, and to have vision of the things that are there, and to
hear the words from thence.</p>
<p><del>11.</del> Let none then introduce the things of earth into heaven; let no one standing here
be careful about what is at his house. For he ought to bear with him, and to preserve both
at home and in his business, what he gains from this place, not to allow it to be loaded with
the burdens of house and market. Our reason for entering in to the chair of instruction is,
that thence we may cleanse ourselves from34 the filth of the outer world; but if we are likely
even in this little space to be injured by things said or done without, it is better for us not
to enter at all. Let no one then in the assembly be thinking about domestic matters, but let
him at home be stirring with what he heard in the assembly. Let these things be more precious
to us than any. These concern the soul, but those the body; or rather what is said here concerns
both body and soul. Wherefore let these things be our leading business, and all others
but occasional employments; for these belong both to the future and the present life, but
the rest neither to the one nor the other, unless they be managed according to the law laid
<note type="footnote">34 al. “rub off.”</note>

<pb n="26"/>
down for these. Since from these it is impossible to learn not only what we shall hereafter
be, and how we shall then live, but how we shall rightly direct this present life also.</p>
<p>For this house is35 a spiritual surgery, that whatever wounds we may have received
without, here36 we may heal, not that we may gather fresh ones to take with us hence. Yet
if we do not give heed to the Spirit speaking to us, we shall not only fail to clear ourselves
of our former hurts, but shall get others in addition.</p>
<p>Let us then with much earnestness attend to the book as it is being unfolded to us; since
if we learn exactly its first principles and fundamental doctrines,37 we shall not afterwards
require much close study, but after laboring a little at the beginning, shall be able, as Paul
says, to instruct others also. ( Rom. xv. 14.) For this Apostle is very sublime, abounding in
many doctrines, and on these he dwells more than on other matters.</p>
<p>Let us not then be careless hearers. And this is the reason why we set them forth to you
by little and little, so that all may be easily intelligible to you, and may not escape your
memory. Let us fear then lest we come under the condemnation of that word which says,
“If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.” ( John xv. 22.) For what
shall we be profited more than those who have not heard, if even after hearing we go our
way home bearing nothing with us, but only wondering at what has been said.</p>
<p>Allow us then to sow in good ground; allow us, that you may draw us the more to you.
If any man hath thorns, let him cast the fire of the Spirit amongst them. If any hath a hard
and stubborn heart, let him by employing the same fire make it soft and yielding. If any by
the wayside is trodden down by all kind of thoughts, let him enter into more sheltered places,
and not lie exposed for those that will to invade for plunder: that so we may see your cornfields
waving with corn. Besides, if we exercise such care as this over ourselves, and apply
ourselves industriously to this spiritual hearing, if not at once yet by degrees, we shall surely
be freed from all the cares of life.</p>
<p>Let us therefore take heed that it be not said of us, that our38 ears are those of a deaf
adder. ( Ps. lviii. 4.) For tell me, in what does a hearer of this kind differ from a beast? and
how could he be otherwise than more irrational than any irrational animal, who does not
attend when God is speaking? And if to be well-pleasing39 to God is really to be a man, what
else but a beast can he be who will not even hear how he may succeed in this? Consider then
what a misfortune it would be for us to fall down40 of our own accord from (the nature of)

<pb n="27"/>
men to (that of) beasts, when Christ is willing of men to make us equal to angels. For to
serve the belly, to be possessed by the desire of riches, to be given to anger, to bite, to kick,
become not men, but beasts. Nay, even the beasts have each, as one may say, one single
passion, and that by nature. But man, when he has cast away the dominion of reason, and
torn himself from the commonwealth of God’s devising, gives himself up to all the passions,
is no longer merely a beast, but a kind of many-formed motley monster; nor has he even
the excuse from nature, for all his wickedness proceeds from deliberate choice and determination.</p>
<p>May we never have cause to suspect this of the Church of Christ. Indeed, we are concerning
you persuaded of better things, and such as belong to salvation; but the more we
are so persuaded, the more careful we will be not to desist from words of caution. In order
that having mounted to the summit of excellencies, we may obtain the promised goods.
Which may it come to pass that we all attain to, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 1</p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> On the subject of attention in hearkening it is superfluous to exhort you any more,
so quickly have you shown by your actions the effects of my advice. For your manner of
running together, your attentive postures, the thrusting one another in your eagerness to
get the inner places, where my voice may more clearly be heard by you, your unwillingness
to retire from the press until this spiritual assembly be dissolved, the clapping of hands, the
murmurs of applause; in a word, all things of this kind may be considered proofs of the
fervor of your souls, and of your desire to hear. So that on this point it is superfluous to exhort
you. One thing, however, it is necessary for us to bid and entreat, that you continue to have
the same zeal, and manifest it not here only, but that also when you are at home, you converse
man with wife, and father with son, concerning these matters. And say somewhat of
yourselves, and require somewhat in return from them; and so all contribute to this excellent
banquet.41</p>
<p>For let no one tell me that our children ought not to be occupied with these things; they
ought not only to be occupied with them, but to be zealous about them only. And although
on account of your infirmity I do not assert this, nor take them away from their worldly
learning,42 just as I do not draw you either from your civil business; yet of these seven days
I claim that you dedicate one to the common Lord of us all. For is it not a strange thing that
we should bid our domestics slave for us all their time, and ourselves apportion not even a
little of our leisure to God; and this too when all our service adds nothing to Him, (for the
Godhead is incapable of want,) but turns out to our own advantage? And yet when you take
your children into the theaters, you allege neither their mathematical lessons, nor anything
of the kind; but if it be required to gain or collect anything spiritual, you call the matter a
waste of time. And how shall you not anger God, if you find leisure and assign a season for
everything else, and yet think it a troublesome and unseasonable thing for your children to
take in hand what relates to Him?</p>
<p>Do not so, brethren, do not so. It is this very age that most of all needs the hearing these
things; for from its tenderness it readily stores up what is said; and what children hear is
impressed as a seal on the wax of their minds. Besides, it is then that their life begins to incline
to vice or virtue; and if from the very gates43 and portals one lead them away from iniquity,

and guide them by the hand to the best road, he will fix them for the time to come in a sort
of habit and nature, and they will not, even if they be willing, easily change for the worse,
since this force of custom draws them to the performance of good actions. So that we shall
see them become more worthy of respect than those who have grown old, and they will be
more useful in civil matters, displaying in youth the qualities of the aged.</p>
<p>For, as I before said, it cannot be that they who enjoy the hearing of such things as these,
and who are in the company of such an Apostle, should depart without receiving some great
and remarkable advantage, be it man, woman, or youth, that partakes of this table. If we
train by words the animals which we have, and so tame them, how much more shall we effect
this with men by this spiritual teaching, when there is a wide difference between the remedy
in each case, and the subject healed as well. For neither is there so much fierceness in us as
in the brutes, since theirs is from nature, ours from choice; nor is the power of the words
the same, for the power of the first is that of the human intellect, the power of the second
is that of the might and grace of the Spirit.44 Let then the man who despairs of himself
consider the tame animals, and he shall no longer be thus affected; let him come continually
to this house of healing, let him hear at all times the laws of the Spirit, and on retiring home
let him write down in his mind the things which he has heard; so shall his hopes be good
and his confidence great, as he feels his progress by experience. For when the devil sees the
law of God written in the soul, and the heart become tablets to write it on, he will not approach
any more. Since wherever the king’s writing is, not engraved on a pillar of brass, but
stamped by the Holy Ghost on a mind loving God, and bright with abundant grace, that
(evil one) will not be able even to look at it, but from afar will turn his back upon us. For
nothing is so terrible to him and to the thoughts which are suggested by him as a mind
careful about Divine matters, and a soul which ever hangs over this fountain. Such an one
can nothing present annoy, even though it be displeasing; nothing puff up or make proud,
even though it be favorable; but amidst all this storm and surge it will even enjoy a great
calm.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For confusion arises within us, not from the nature of circumstances, but from the
infirmity of our minds; for if we were thus affected by reason of what befalls us, then, (as
we all sail the same sea, and it is impossible to escape waves and spray,) all men must needs
be troubled; but if there are some who stand beyond the influence of the storm and the raging
sea, then it is clear that it is not circumstances which make the storm, but the condition of
our own mind. If therefore we so order the mind that it may bear all things contentedly, we
shall have no storm nor even a ripple, but always a clear calm.</p>
<p>After professing that I should say nothing on these points, I know not how I have been
carried away into such a length of exhortation. Pardon my prolixity; for I fear, yes, I greatly
<note type="footnote">44 i.e. Man is more tractable than brutes, the words of the Spirit more powerful than words of reason.</note>

<pb n="30"/>
fear lest this zeal of ours should ever become weaker. Did I feel confident respecting it, I
would not now have said to you anything on these matters, since it is sufficient to make all
things easy to you. But it is time in what follows to proceed to the matters proposed for
consideration to-day; that you may not come weary to the contest. For we have contests
against the enemies of the truth, against those who use every artifice to destroy the honor
of the Son of God, or rather their own. This remains for ever as it now is, nothing lessened
by the blaspheming tongue, but they, by seeking eagerly to pull down Him whom they say
they worship, fill their faces with shame and their souls with punishment.</p>
<p>What then do they say when we assert what we have asserted? “That the words, ‘in the
beginning was the Word,’ do not denote eternity absolutely, for that this same expression
was used also concerning heaven and earth.” What enormous shamelessness and irreverence!
I speak to thee concerning God, and dost thou bring the earth into the argument, and men
who are of the earth? At this rate, since Christ is called Son of God, and God, Man who is
called Son of God must be God also. For, “I have said, Ye are Gods, and all of you are children
of the Most High.” ( Ps. lxxxii. 6.) Wilt thou contend with the Only-Begotten concerning
Sonship, and assert that in that respect He enjoys nothing more than thou? “By no means,”
is the reply. And yet thou doest this even though thou say not so in words. “How?” Because
thou sayest that thou by grace art partaker of the adoption, and He in like manner. For by
saying that He is not Son by nature, thou only makest him to be so by grace.</p>
<p>However, let us see the proofs which they produce to us. “In the beginning,” it is said,
“God made the Heaven and the earth, and the earth was invisible and unformed.” ( Gen. i.
2.) And, “There ‘was’ a man of Ramathaim Zophim.” ( 1 Sam. i. 1.) These are what they
think strong arguments, and they are strong; but it is to prove the correctness of the doctrines
asserted by us, while they are utterly powerless to establish their blasphemy. For tell me,
what has the word “was” in common with the word “made”? What hath God in common
with man? Why dost thou mix what may not be mixed? Why confound things which are
distinct, why bring low what is above? In that place it is not the expression “was” only which
denotes eternity, but that One “was in the beginning.” And that other, “The Word was”; for
as the word “being,” when used concerning man, only distinguishes present time, but when
concerning God, denotes eternity,45 so “was,” when used respecting our nature, signifies to
us past time, and that too limited, but when respecting God it declares eternity. It would
have been enough then when one had heard the words “earth” and “man,” to imagine
nothing more concerning them than what one may fitly think of a nature that came into
being,46 for that which came to be, be it what it may, hath come to be either in time, or the

age before time was, but the Son of God is above not only times, but all ages which were
before, for He is the Creator and Maker of them, as the Apostle says, “by whom also He
made the ages.” Now the Maker necessarily is, before the thing made. Yet since some are
so senseless, as even after this to have higher notions concerning creatures than is their due,
by the expression “He made,” and by that other, “there was a man,” he lays hold beforehand
of the mind of his hearer, and cuts up all shamelessness by the roots. For all that has been
made, both heaven and earth, has been made in time, and has its beginning in time, and
none of them is without beginning, as having been made: so that when you hear that “he
made the earth,” and that “there was a man,” you are trifling47 to no purpose, and weaving
a tissue of useless folly.</p>
<p>For I can mention even another thing by way of going further. What is it? It is, that if
it had been said of the earth, “In the beginning was the earth,” and of man, “In the beginning
was the man,” we must not even then have imagined any greater things concerning them
than what we have now determined.48 For the terms “earth” and “man” as they are presupposed,
whatever may be said concerning them, do not allow the mind to imagine to itself
anything greater concerning them than what we know at present. Just as “the Word,” although
but little be said of It, does not allow us to think (respecting It) anything low or poor.
Since in proceeding he says of the earth, “The earth was invisible and unformed.” For having
said that “He made” it, and having settled its proper limit, he afterwards declares fearlessly
what follows, as knowing that there is no one so silly as to suppose that it is without beginning
and uncreated, since the word “earth,” and that other “made,” are enough to convince even
a very simple person that it is not eternal nor increate, but one of those things created in
time.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Besides, the expression “was,” applied to the earth and to man, is not indicative of
absolute existence. But in the case of a man (it denotes) his being of a certain place, in that
of the earth its being in a certain way. For he has not said absolutely “the earth was,” and
then held his peace, but has taught how it was even after its creation, as that it was “invisible
and unformed,” as yet covered by the waters and in confusion. So in the case of Elkanah he
does not merely say that “there was a man,” but adds also whence he was, “of Armathaim
Zophim.” But in the case of “the Word,” it is not so. I am ashamed to try these cases, one
against the other, for if we find fault with those who do so in the case of men, when there
is a great difference in the virtue of those who are so tried, though in truth their substance
be one; where the difference both of nature and of everything else is so infinite, is it not the
extremest madness to raise such questions? But may He who is blasphemed by them be
<note type="footnote">47 al. “trifle not.”</note>
<note type="footnote">48 al. “is now contained in them.”</note>

<pb n="32"/>
merciful to us. For it was not we who invented the necessity of such discussions, but they
who war against their own salvation laid it on us.</p>
<p>What then do I say? That this first “was,” applied to “the Word,” is only indicative of
His eternal Being, (for “In the beginning,” he saith, “was the Word,”) and that the second
“was,” (“and the Word was with God,”) denotes His relative Being. For since to be eternal
and without beginning is most peculiar to God, this he puts first; and then, lest any one
hearing that He was “in the beginning,” should assert, that He was “unbegotten” also, he
immediately remedies this by saying, before he declares what He was, that He was “with
God.” And he has prevented any one from supposing, that this “Word” is simply such a one
as is either uttered49 or conceived,50 by the addition, as I beforesaid, of the article, as well
as by this second expression. For he does not say, was “in God,” but was “with God”: declaring
to us His eternity as to person.51 Then, as he advances, he has more clearly revealed it, by
adding, that this “Word” also “was God.”</p>
<p>“But yet created,” it may be said. What then hindered him from saying, that “In the
beginning God made the Word”? at least Moses speaking of the earth says, not that “in the
beginning was the earth,” but that “He made it,” and then it was. What now hindered John
from saying in like manner, that “In the beginning God made the Word”? For if Moses
feared lest any one should assert that the earth was uncreated,52 much more ought John to
have feared this respecting the Son, if He was indeed created. The world being visible, by
this very circumstance proclaims its Maker, (“the heavens,” says the Psalmist, “declare the
glory of God”— Ps. xix. 1 ), but the Son is invisible, and is greatly, infinitely, higher than
all creation. If now, in the one instance, where we needed neither argument nor teaching
to know that the world is created, 53 yet the prophet sets down this fact clearly and before
all others; much more should John have declared the same concerning the Son, if He had
really been created.54</p>
<p>“Yes,” it may be said, “but Peter has asserted this clearly and openly.” Where and when?
“When speaking to the Jews he said, that ‘God hath made Him both Lord and Christ.’” (
Acts ii. 36.) Why dost thou not add what follows, “That same Jesus whom ye have crucified”?
or dost thou not know that of the words, part relate to His unmixed Nature, part to His Incarnation?
55 But if this be not the case, and thou wilt absolutely understand all as referring

to the Godhead, then thou wilt make the Godhead capable of suffering; but if not capable
of suffering, then not created. For if blood had flowed from that divine and ineffable Nature,
and if that Nature, and not the flesh, had been torn and cut by the nails upon the cross, on
this supposition your quibbling would have had reason; but if not even the devil himself
could utter such a blasphemy, why dost thou feign to be ignorant with ignorance so unpardonable,
and such as not the evil spirits themselves could pretend? Besides the expressions
“Lord” and “Christ” belong not to His Essence, but to His dignity; for the one refers to His
Power,56 the other to his having been anointed. What then wouldest thou say con cerning
the Son of God? for if he were even, as you assert, created, this argument could not have
place. For He was not first created and afterwards God chose Him, nor does He hold a
kingdom which could be thrown aside, but one which belongs by nature to His Essence;
since, when asked if He were a King, He answers, “To this end was I born.” ( c. xviii. 37.)
But Peter speaks as concerning one chosen, because his argument wholly refers to the Dispensation.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> And why dost thou wonder if Peter says this? for Paul, reasoning with the Athenians,
calls Him “Man” only, saying, “By that Man whom He hath ordained, whereof He hath
given assurance to all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.” ( Acts xvii. 31.) He
speaks nothing concerning “the form of God” ( Philip. ii. 6 ), nor that He was “equal to
Him,” nor that He was the “brightness of His glory.” ( Heb. i. 3.) And with reason. The time
for words like these was not yet come; but it would have contented him that they should in
the meanwhile admit that He was Man, and that He rose again from the dead. Christ Himself
acted in the same manner, from whom Paul having learned, used this reserve.57 For He did
not at once reveal to us His Divinity, but was at first held to be a Prophet and a good man;58
but afterwards His real nature was shown by His works and words. On this account Peter
too at first used this method, (for this was the first sermon that he made to the Jews;) and
because they were not yet able clearly to understand anything respecting His Godhead, he
dwelt on the arguments relating to His Incarnation; that their ears being exercised in these,
might open a way to the rest of his teaching. And if any one will go through all the sermon
from the beginning, he will find what I say very observable, for he (Peter) calls Him “Man,”
and dwells on the accounts of His Passion, His Resurrection, and His generation according
to the flesh. Paul too when he says, “Who was born of the seed of David according to the
flesh” ( Rom. i. 3 ), only teaches us that the word “made”59 is taken with a view60 to His
<note type="footnote">56 ἐ ξουσία.</note>

<note type="footnote">60 παρείληπται ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκονομίας, “adopted in reference to.”</note>

<pb n="34"/>
Incarnation, as we allow. But the son of thunder is now speaking to us concerning His Ineffable
and Eternal61 Existence, and therefore he leaves the word “made” and puts “was”; yet
if He were created, this point he needs must most especially have determined. For if Paul
feared that some foolish persons might suppose that He shall be greater than the Father,
and have Him who begat Him made subject to Him, (for this is the reason why the Apostle
in sending to the Corinthians writes, “But when He saith, All things are put under Him, it
is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him,” yet who could possibly
imagine that the Father, even in common with all things, will be subject to the Son?) if, I
say, he nevertheless feared these foolish imaginations, and says, “He is excepted that did
put all things under Him;” much more if the Son of God were indeed created, ought John
to have feared lest any one should suppose Him uncreated, and to have taught on this point
before any other.</p>
<p>But now, since He was Begotten, with good reason neither John nor any other, whether
apostle or prophet, hath asserted that He was created. Neither had it been so would the
Only-Begotten Himself have let it pass unmentioned. For He who spoke of Himself so
humbly from condescension62 would certainly not have been silent on this matter. And I
think it not unreasonable to suppose, that He would be more likely to have the higher Nature,
and say nothing of it, than not having it to pass by this omission, and fail to make known
that He had it not. For in the first case there was a good excuse for silence, namely, His desire
to teach mankind humility by being silent as to the greatness of His attributes; but in the
second case you can find no just excuse for silence. For why should He who declined many
of His real attributes have been, if He were created, silent as to His having been made? He
who, in order to teach humility, often uttered expressions of lowliness, such as did not
properly belong to Him, much more if He had been indeed created, would not have failed
to speak of this. Do you not see Him, in order that none may imagine Him not to have been
begotten,63 doing and saying everything to show that He was so, uttering words unworthy
both of His dignity and His essence, and descending to the humble character of a Prophet?
For the expression, “As I hear, I judge” ( v. 30 ); and that other, “He hath told Me what I
should say, and what I should speak” ( xii. 49 ), and the like, belong merely to a prophet. If
now, from His desire to remove this suspicion, He did not disdain to utter words thus lowly,
much more if He were created would He have said many like words, that none might suppose
Him to be uncreated; as, “Think not that I am begotten of the Father; I am created, not begotten,
nor do I share His essence.” But as it is, He does the very contrary, and utters words
which compel men, even against their will and desire, to admit the opposite opinion. As, “I

<note type="footnote">63 ἀ γέννητον.</note>

<pb n="35"/>
am in the Father, and the Father in Me” ( xiv. 11 ); and, “Have I been so long time with you,
and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.” ( xiv.
9.) And, “That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.” ( v. 23.) “As
the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He
will.” ( v. 21.) “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” ( v. 17.) “As the Father knoweth
Me, even so know I the Father.” ( x. 15.) “I and My Father are One.” ( x. 30.) And everywhere
by putting the “as,” and the “so,” and the “being with the Father,” He declares His undeviating
likeness to Him.64 His power in Himself He manifests by these, as well as by many other
words; as when He says, “Peace, be still.” ( Mark iv. 39.) “I will, be thou clean.” ( Matt. viii.
3.) “Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him.” ( Mark ix. 25.) And again,
“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; but I say unto you,
That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger.” ( Matt. v. 21,
22.) And all the other laws which He gave, and wonders which He worked, are sufficient to
show His power, or rather, I should say, a very small part of them is enough to bring over
and convince any, except the utterly insensate.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But vainglory65 is a thing powerful to blind even to very evident truths the minds
of those ensnared by it, and to persuade them to dispute against what is allowed by others;
nay, it instigates66 some who know and are persuaded of the truth to pretended ignorance
and opposition. As took place in the case of the Jews, for they did not through ignorance
deny the Son of God, but that they might obtain honor from the multitude; “they believed,”
says the Evangelist, but were afraid, “lest they should be put out of the synagogue.” ( xii.
40.) And so they gave up67 their salvation to others.68 For it cannot be that he who is so
zealous a slave to the glory of this present world can obtain the glory which is from God.
Wherefore He rebuked them, saying, “How can ye believe, which receive honor of men,
and seek not the honor which cometh from God?” ( v. 44.) This passion is a sort of deep
intoxication, and makes him who is subdued by it hard to recover. And having detached
the souls of its captives from heavenly things, it nails them to earth, and lets them not look
up to the true light, but persuades them ever to wallow in the mire, giving them masters so
powerful, that they have the rule over them without needing to use commands. For the man
who is sick of this disease, does of his own accord, and without bidding, all that he thinks
will be agreeable to his masters. On their account he clothes himself in rich apparel, and
beautifies his face, taking these pains not for himself but for others; and he leads about a

train of followers through the market-place, that others may admire him, and all that he
does he goes through, merely out of obsequiousness to the rest of the world. Can any state
of mind be more wretched than this? That others may admire him, he is ever being precipitated69
to ruin.</p>
<p>Would you learn what a tyrannous sway it exercises? Why surely, the words of Christ
are sufficient to show it all. But yet listen to these further remarks.70 If you will ask any of
those men who mingle in state affairs and incur great expenses, why they lavish so much
gold, and what their so vast expenditure means; you will hear from them, that it is for
nothing else but to gratify the people. If again you ask what the people may be; they will say,
that it is a thing full of confusion and turbulent, made up for the most part of folly, tossed
blindly to and fro like the waves of the sea, and often composed of varying and adverse
opinions. Must not the man who has such a master be more pitiable than any one? And yet
strange though it be, it is not so strange that worldly men should be eager about these things;
but that those who say that they have started away from the world should be sick of this
same disease, or rather of one more grievous still, this is the strangest thing of all. For with
the first the loss extends only to money, but in the last case the danger reaches to the soul.
For when men alter a right faith for reputation’s sake, and dishonor God that they may be
in high repute themselves, tell me, what excess of stupidity and madness must there not be
in what they do? Other passions, even if they are very hurtful, at least bring some pleasure
with them, though it be but for a time and fleeting; those who love money, or wine, or women,
have, with their hurt, a pleasure, though a brief one. But those who are taken captives by
this passion, live a life continually embittered and stripped of enjoyment, for they do not
obtain what they earnestly desire, glory, I mean, from the many. They think they enjoy it,
but do not really, because the thing they aim at is not glory at all. And therefore their state
of mind is not called glory,71 but a something void of glory, vaingloriousness,72 so have all
the ancients named it, and with good reason; inasmuch as it is quite empty, and contains
nothing bright or glorious within it, but as players’ masks seem to be bright and lovely, but
are hollow within, (for which cause, though they be more beautiful than natural faces, yet
they never draw any to love them,) even so, or rather yet more wretchedly, has the applause
of the multitude tricked out for us this passion, dangerous as an antagonist, and cruel as a
master. Its countenance alone is bright, but within it is no more like the mask’s mere
emptiness, but crammed with dishonor, and full of savage tyranny. Whence then, it may
be asked, has this passion, so unreasonable, so devoid of pleasure, its birth? Whence else
<note type="footnote">69 κατακρημνίζεται.</note>
<note type="footnote">70 al. “but it may be seen from this.”</note>
<note type="footnote">71 δόξα.</note>
<note type="footnote">72 κενοδοξία, lit. “empty glory.”</note>

<pb n="37"/>
but from a low, mean soul? It cannot be that one who is captivated by love of applause should
imagine readily anything great or noble; he needs must be base, mean, dishonorable, little.
He who does nothing for virtue’s sake, but to please men worthy of no consideration, and
who ever makes account of their mistaken and erring opinions, how can he be worth anything?
Consider; if any one should ask him, What do you think of the many? he clearly
would say, “that they are thoughtless, and not to be regarded.” Then if any one again should
ask him, “Would you choose to be like them?” I do not suppose he could possibly desire to
be like them. Must it not then be excessively ridiculous to seek the good opinion of those
whom you never would choose to resemble?</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Do you say that they are many and a sort of collective body? this is the very reason
why you ought most to despise them. If when taken singly they are contemptible, still more
will this be the case when they are many; for when they are assembled together, their individual
folly is increased by numbers, and becomes greater. So that a man might possibly
take a single one of them and set him right, but could not do so with them when together,
because then their folly becomes intense, and they are led like sheep, and follow in every
direction the opinions of one another. Tell me, will you seek to obtain this vulgar glory? Do
not, I beg and entreat you. It turns everything upside down; it is the mother of avarice, of
slander, of false witness, of treacheries; it arms and exasperates those who have received no
injury against those who have inflicted none. He who has fallen into this disease neither
knows friendship nor remembers old companionship, and knows not how to respect any
one at all; he has cast away from his soul all goodness, and is at war with every one, unstable,
without natural affection.</p>
<p>Again, the passion of anger, tyrannical though it be and hard to bear, still is not wont
always to disturb, but only when it has persons that excite it; but that of vainglory is ever
active, and there is no time, as one may say, when it can cease, since reason neither hinders
nor restrains it, but it is always with us not only persuading us to sin, but snatching from
our hands anything which we may chance to do aright, or sometimes not allowing us to do
right at all. If Paul calls covetousness idolatry, what ought we to name that which is mother,
and root, and source of it, I mean, vainglory? We cannot possibly find any term such as its
wickedness deserves. Beloved, let us now return to our senses; let us put off this filthy garment,
let us rend and cut it off from us, let us at some time or other become free with true
freedom, and be sensible of the nobility73 which has been given to us by God; let us despise
vulgar applause. For nothing is so ridiculous and disgraceful as this passion, nothing so full
of shame and dishonor. One may in many ways see, that to love honor, is dishonor; and
that true honor consists in neglecting honor, in making no account of it, but in saying and
doing everything according to what seems good to God. In this way we shall be able to receive
<note type="footnote">73 εὐγενεία, “high birth.”</note>

<pb n="38"/>
a reward from Him who sees exactly all our doings, if we are content to have Him only for
a spectator. What need we other eyes, when He who shall confer the prize is ever beholding
our actions? Is it not a strange thing that, whatever a servant does, he should do to please
his master, should seek nothing more than his master’s observation, desire not to attract
other eyes (though they be great men who are looking on) to his conduct, but aim at one
thing only, that his master may observe him; while we who have a Lord so great, seek other
spectators who can nothing profit, but rather hurt us by their observation, and make all our
labor vain? Not so, I beseech you. Let us call Him to applaud and view our actions from
whom we shall receive our rewards. Let us have nothing to do with human eyes. For if we
should even desire to attain this honor, we shall then attain to it, when we seek that which
cometh from God alone. For, He saith, “Them that honor Me, I will honor.” ( 1 Sam. ii. 30
.) And even as we are best supplied with riches when we despise them, and seek only the
wealth which cometh from God (“Seek,” he saith, “the kingdom of God, and all these things
shall be added to you”— Matt. vi. 33 ); so it is in the case of honor. When the granting either
of riches or honor is no longer attended with danger to us, then God gives them freely; and
it is then unattended with danger, when they have not the rule or power over us, do not
command us as slaves, but belong to us as masters and free men. For the reason that He
wishes us not to love them is, that we may not be ruled by them; and if we succeed in this
respect, He gives us them with great liberality. Tell me, what is brighter than Paul, when he
says, “We seek not honor of men, neither of you, nor yet of others.” ( 1 Thess. ii. 6.) What
then is richer than him who hath nothing, and yet possesseth all things? for as I said, when
we are not mastered by them, then we shall master them, then we shall receive them. If then
we desire to obtain honor, let us shun honor, so shall we be enabled after accomplishing the
laws of God to obtain both the good things which are here, and those which are promised,
by the grace of Christ, with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily IV.</head>
<p>John i. 1</p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> When children are just brought to their learning, their teachers do not give them
many tasks in succession, nor do they set them once for all, but they often repeat to them
the same short ones, so that what is said may be easily implanted in their minds, and they
may not be vexed at the first onset with the quantity, and with finding it hard to remember,
and become less active in picking up what is given them, a kind of sluggishness arising from
the difficulty. And I, who wish to effect the same with you, and to render your labor easy,
take by little and little the food which lies on this Divine table, and instill it into your souls.
On this account I shall handle again the same words, not so as to say again the same things,
but to set before you only what yet remains. Come, then, let us again apply our discourse
to the introduction.</p>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” Why, when all the other
Evangelists had begun with the Dispensation74 ; (for Matthew says, “The Book of the generation
of Jesus Christ, the Son of David”; and Luke too relates to us in the beginning of his
Gospel the events relating to Mary; and in like manner Mark dwells on the same narratives,
from that point detailing to us the history of the Baptist;) why, when they began with these
matters, did John briefly and in a later place hint at them, saying, “the Word was made flesh”
( ver. 14 .); and, passing by everything else, His conception, His birth, His bringing up, His
growth, at once discourse to us concerning His Eternal Generation?</p>
<p>I will now tell you what the reason of this is. Because the other Evangelists had dwelt
most on the accounts of His coming in the flesh, there was fear lest some, being of grovelling
minds, might for this reason rest in these doctrines alone, as indeed was the case with Paul
of Samosata. In order, therefore, to lead away from this fondness for earth those who were
like to fall into it, and to draw them up towards heaven, with good reason he commences
his narrative from above, and from the eternal subsistence. For while Matthew enters upon
his relation from Herod the king, Luke from Tiberius Cæsar, Mark from the Baptism of
John, this Apostle, leaving alone all these things, ascends beyond all time or age.75 Thither
darting forward the imagination of his hearers to the “was in the beginning,” not allowing
it to stay at any point, nor setting any limit, as they did in Herod, and Tiberius, and John.</p>
<p>And what we may mention besides as especially deserving our admiration is, that John,
though he gave himself up to the higher doctrine,76 yet did not neglect the Dispensation;
<note type="footnote">74 οἰκονομίας.</note>
<note type="footnote">75 αἰῶνος.</note>
<note type="footnote">76 λόγον.</note>

<pb n="40"/>
nor were the others, though intent upon the relation of this, silent as to the subsistence before
the ages. With good cause; for One Spirit It was that moved the souls of all; and therefore
they have shown great unanimity in their narrative. But thou, beloved, when thou hast heard
of “The Word,” do not endure those who say, that He is a work; nor those even who think,
that He is simply a word. For many are the words of God which angels execute, but of those
words none is God; they all are prophecies or commands, (for in Scripture it is usual to call
the laws of God His commands, and prophecies, words; wherefore in speaking of the angels,
he says, “Mighty in strength, fulfilling His word”) ( Ps. ciii. 20 ), but this Word is a Being
with subsistence,77 proceeding78 without affection79 from the Father Himself. For this, as
I before said, he has shown by the term “Word.” As therefore the expression, “In the beginning
was the Word,” shows His Eternity, so “was in the beginning with God,” has declared
to us His Co-eternity. For that you may not, when you hear “In the beginning was the Word,”
suppose Him to be Eternal, and yet imagine the life of the Father to differ from His by some
interval and longer duration, and so assign a beginning to the Only-Begotten, he adds, “was
in the beginning with God”; so eternally even as the Father Himself, for the Father was
never without the Word, but He was always God with God, yet Each in His proper Person.80</p>
<p>How then, one says, does John assert, that He was in the world, if He was with God?
Because He was both81 with God and in the world also. For neither Father nor Son are
limited in any way. Since, if “there is no end of His greatness” ( Ps. cxlv. 3 ), and if “of His
wisdom there is no number” ( Ps. cxlvii. 5 ), it is clear that there cannot be any beginning
in time82 to His Essence. Thou hast heard, that “In the beginning God made the heaven and
the earth” ( Gen. i. 1 ); what dost thou understand from this “beginning”? clearly, that they
were created before all visible things. So, respecting the Only-Begotten, when you hear that
He was “in the beginning,” conceive of him as before all intelligible things,83 and before the
ages.</p>
<p>But if any one say, “How can it be that He is a Son, and yet not younger than the Father?
since that which proceeds from something else needs must be later than that from which it
proceeds”; we will say that, properly speaking, these are human reasonings; that he who
questions on this matter will question on others yet more improper;84 and that to such we

ought not even to give ear. For our speech is now concerning God, not concerning the nature
of men, which is subject to the sequence and necessary conclusions of these reasonings.
Still, for the assurance of the weaker sort, we will speak even to these points.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Tell me, then, does the radiance of the sun proceed from the substance85 itself of
the sun, or from some other source? Any one not deprived of his very senses needs must
confess, that it proceeds from the substance itself. Yet, although the radiance proceeds from
the sun itself, we cannot say that it is later in point of time than the substance of that body,
since the sun has never appeared without its rays. Now if in the case of these visible and
sensible bodies there has been shown to be something which proceeds from something else,
and yet is not after that from whence it proceeds; why are you incredulous in the case of the
invisible and ineffable Nature? This same thing there takes place, but in a manner suitable
to That Substance.86 For it is for this reason that Paul too calls Him “Brightness” ( Heb. i.
3 ); setting forth thereby His being from Him and His Co-eternity. Again, tell me, were not
all the ages, and every interval87 created by Him? Any man not deprived of his senses must
necessarily confess this. There is no interval88 therefore between the Son and the Father;
and if there be none, then He is not after, but Co-eternal with Him. For “before” and “after”
are notions implying time, since, without age or time, no man could possibly imagine these
words; but God is above times and ages.</p>
<p>But if in any case you say that you have found a beginning to the Son, see whether by
the same reason and argument you are not compelled to reduce the Father also to a beginning,
earlier indeed, but still a beginning. For when you have assigned to the Son a limit and beginning
of existence, do you not proceed upwards from that point, and say, that the Father
was before it? Clearly you do. Tell me then, what is the extent of the Father’s prior subsistence?
For whether you say that the interval is little, or whether you say it is great, you equally
have brought the Father to a beginning. For it is clear, that it is by measuring the space that
you say whether it is little or great; yet it would not be possible to measure it, unless there
were a beginning on either side; so that as far as you are concerned you have given the
Father a beginning, and henceforth, according to your argument, not even the Father will
be without beginning. See you that the word spoken by the Saviour is true, and the saying
everywhere discovers its force? And what is that word? It is “He that honoreth not the Son,
honoreth not the Father.” ( John v. 23.)</p>
<p>And I know indeed that what now has been said cannot by many be comprehended,
and therefore it is that in many places we avoid89 agitating questions of human reasonings,

because the rest of the people cannot follow such arguments, and if they could, still they
have nothing firm or sure in them. “For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our
devices are but uncertain.” ( Wisd. ix. 14.) Still I should like to ask our objectors, what means
that which is said by the Prophet, “Before Me there was no God formed, nor is there any
after Me”? ( Is. xliii. 10.) For if the Son is younger than the Father, how, says He, “Nor is
there90 any after me”? Will you take away the being of the Only-Begotten Himself? You
either must dare this, or admit one Godhead with distinct Persons of the Father and Son.</p>
<p>Finally, how could the expression, “All things were made by Him,” be true? For if there
is an age older than He, how can that91 which was before Him have been made by Him?
See ye to what daring the argument has carried them, when once the truth has been unsettled?
Why did not the Evangelist say, that He was made from things that were not, as
Paul declares of all things, when he says, “Who calleth those things which be not as though
they were”; but says, “Was in the beginning”? ( Rom. iv. 17.) This is contrary to that; and
with good reason. For God neither is made,92 nor has anything older; these are words of
the Greeks.93 Tell me this too: Would you not say, that the Creator beyond all comparison
excels His works? Yet since that which is from things that were not is similar to them, where
is the superiority not admitting of comparison? And what mean the expressions, “I am the
first and I am the last” ( Is. xliv. 6 ); and, “before Me was no other God formed”? ( Is. xliii.
10.) For if the Son be not of the same Essence, there is another God; and if He be not Coeternal,
He is after Him; and if He did not proceed from His Essence, clear it is that He was
made. But if they assert, that these things were said to distinguish Him from idols, why do
they not allow that it is to distinguish Him from idols that he says, “the Only True God”? (
John xvii. 3.) Besides, if this was said to distinguish Him from idols, how would you interpret
the whole sentence? “After Me,” He says, “is no other God.” In saying this, He does not exclude
the Son, but that “After Me there is no idol God,” not that “there is no Son.” Allowed,
says he; what then? and the expression, “Before Me was no other God formed,” will you so
understand, as that no idol God indeed was formed before Him, but yet a Son was formed
before Him? What evil spirit would assert this? I do not suppose that even Satan himself
would do so.</p>
<p>Moreover, if He be not Co-eternal with the Father, how can you say that His Life is infinite?
For if it have a beginning from before,94 although it be endless, yet it is not infinite;
for the infinite must be infinite in both directions. As Paul also declared, when he said,
<note type="footnote">90 LXX. ἔ στιν.</note>
<note type="footnote">91 τὸ, al. ὁ.</note>
<note type="footnote">92 γίνεται.</note>
<note type="footnote">93 Heathens.</note>
<note type="footnote">94 ἄ νωθεν, “a parte ante.”</note>


<pb n="43"/>
“Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life” ( Heb. vii. 3 ); by this expression showing
that He is both without beginning and without end. For as the one has no limit, so neither
has the other. In one direction there is no end, in the other no beginning.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And how again, since He is “Life,” was there ever when He was not? For all must
allow, that Life both is always, and is without beginning and without end, if It be indeed
Life, as indeed It is. For if there be when It is not, how can It be the life of others, when It
even Itself is not?</p>
<p>“How then,” says one, “does John lay down a beginning by saying, ‘In the beginning
was’?” Tell me, have you attended to the “In the beginning,” and to the “was,” and do you
not understand the expression, “the Word was”? What! when the Prophet says, “From
everlasting95 and to everlasting Thou art” ( Ps. xc. 2 ), does he say this to assign Him limits?
No, but to declare His Eternity. Consider now that the case is the same in this place. He did
not use the expression as assigning limits, since he did not say, “had a beginning,” but “was
in the beginning”; by the word “was” carrying thee forward to the idea that the Son is without
beginning. “Yet observe,” says he, “the Father is named with the addition of the article, but
the Son without it.” What then, when the Apostle says, “The Great God, and our Saviour
Jesus Christ” ( Tit. ii. 13 ); and again, “Who is above all, God”? ( Rom. ix. 5.) It is true that
here he has mentioned the Son, without the article; but he does the same with the Father
also, at least in his Epistle to the Philippians ( c. ii. 6 ), he says, “Who being in the form of
God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God”; and again to the Romans, “Grace to you,
and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.” ( Rom. i. 7.) Besides, it was
superfluous for it to be attached in that place, when close96 above it was continually attached
to “the Word.” For as in speaking concerning the Father, he says, “God is a Spirit” ( John
iv. 24 ), and we do not, because the article is not joined to “Spirit,” yet deny the Spiritual
Nature of God; so here, although the article is not annexed to the Son, the Son is not on that
account a less God. Why so? Because in saying “God,” and again “God,” he does not reveal
to us any difference in this Godhead, but the contrary; for having before said, “and the Word
was God”; that no one might suppose the Godhead of the Son to be inferior, he immediately
adds the characteristics of genuine Godhead, including Eternity, (for “He was,” says he, “in
the beginning with God,”) and attributing to Him the office of Creator. For “by Him were
all things made, and without Him was not anything made that was made”; which His Father
also everywhere by the Prophets declares to be especially characteristic of His own Essence.
And the Prophets are continually busy on this kind of demonstration, not only of itself, but
when they contend against the honor shown to idols; “Let the gods perish,” says one “who
have not made heaven and earth” ( Jer. x. 11 ): and again, “I have stretched out the heaven
<note type="footnote">95 ἀ πὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος.</note>
<note type="footnote">96 συνεχῶς.</note>

<pb n="44"/>
with My hand” ( Is. xliv. 24 ); and it is as declaring it to be indicative of Divinity, that He
everywhere puts it. And the Evangelist himself was not satisfied with these words, but calls
Him “Life” too and “Light.” If now He was ever with the Father, if He Himself created all
things, if He brought all things into existence, and keeps together97 all things, (for, this he
meant by “Life,”) if He enlightens all things, who so senseless as to say, that the Evangelist
desired to teach an inferiority of Divinity by those very expressions, by which, rather than
by any others, it is possible to express its equality and not differing? Let us not then confound
the creation with the Creator, lest we too hear it said of us, that “they served the creature
rather than the Creator” ( Rom. i. 25 ); for although it be asserted that this is said of the
heavens, still in speaking of the heavens he positively says, that we must not serve98 the
creature, for it is a heathenish99 thing.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us therefore not lay ourselves under this curse. For this the Son of God came,
that He might rid us from this service; for this He took the form of a slave, that He might
free us from this slavery; for this He was spit upon, for this He was buffeted, for this He
endured the shameful death. Let us not, I entreat you, make all these things of none effect,
let us not go back to our former unrighteousness, or rather to unrighteousness much more
grievous; for to serve the creature is not the same thing as to bring down the Creator, as far
at least as in us lies, to the meanness of the creature. For He continues being such as He is;
as says the Psalmist, “Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.” ( Ps. cii. 27.) Let us
then glorify Him as we have received from our fathers, let us glorify Him both by our faith
and by our works; for sound doctrines avail us nothing to salvation, if our life is corrupt.
Let us then order it according to what is well-pleasing to God, setting ourselves far from all
filthiness, unrighteousness, and covetousness, as strangers and foreigners and aliens to the
things here on earth. If any have much wealth and possessions, let him so use them as one
who is a sojourner, and who, whether he will or not, shall shortly pass from them. If one be
injured by another, let him not be angry forever, nay rather not even for a time. For the
Apostle has not allowed us more than a single day for the venting of anger.</p>
<p>“Let not,” says he, “the sun go down upon your wrath” ( Eph. iv. 26 ); and with reason;
for it is matter for contentment that even in so short a time nothing unpleasant take place;
but if night also overtake us, what has happened becomes more grievous, because the fire
of our wrath is increased ten thousand times by memory, and we at our leisure enquire into
it more bitterly. Before therefore we obtain this pernicious leisure and kindle a hotter fire,
he bids us arrest beforehand and quench the mischief. For the passion of wrath is fierce,
fiercer than any flame; and so we need much haste to prevent the flame, and not allow it to

blaze up high, for so this disease becomes a cause of many evils. It has overturned whole
houses, it has dissolved old companionships, and has worked tragedies not to be remedied
in a short moment of time. “For,” saith one, “the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.”
( Ecclus. i. 22.) Let us not then leave such a wild beast unbridled, but put upon him a muzzle
in all ways strong, the fear of the judgment to come. Whenever a friend grieves thee, or one
of thine own family exasperates thee, think of the sins thou hast committed against God,
and that by kindness towards him thou makest that judgment more lenient to thyself,
(“Forgive,” saith He, “and ye shall be forgiven”) ( Luke vi. 37 ), and thy passion shall quickly
skulk away.100</p>
<p>And besides, consider this, whether there has been a time when thou wert being carried
away into ferocity, and didst control thyself, and another time when thou hast been dragged
along by the passion. Compare the two seasons, and thou shalt gain thence great improvement.
For tell me, when didst thou praise thyself? Was it when thou wast worsted, or when
thou hadst the mastery? Do we not in the first case vehemently blame ourselves, and feel
ashamed. even when none reproves us, and do not many feelings of repentance come over
us, both for what we have said and done; but when we gain the mastery, then are we not
proud, and exult as conquerors? For victory in the case of anger is, not the requiting evil
with the like, (that is utter defeat,) but the bearing meekly to be ill treated and ill spoken of.
To get the better is not to inflict but to suffer evil. Therefore when angry do not say, “certainly
I will retaliate,” “certainly I will be revenged”; do not persist in saying to those who exhort
you to gain a victory, “I will not endure that the man mock me, and escape clear.” He will
never mock thee, except when thou avengest thyself; or if he even should mock thee he will
do so as a fool. Seek not when thou conquerest honor from fools, but consider that sufficient
which comes from men of understanding. Nay, why do I set before thee a small and mean
body of spectators, when I make it up of men? Look up straight to God: He will praise thee,
and the man who is approved by Him must not seek honor from mortals. Mortal honor
often arises from flattery or hatred of others, and brings no profit; but the decision of God
is free from this inequality, and brings great advantage to the man whom He approves. This
praise then let us follow after.</p>
<p>Will you learn what an evil is anger? Stand by while others are quarreling in the forum.
In yourself you cannot easily see the disgrace of the thing, because your reason is darkened
and drunken; but when you are clear from the passion, and while your judgment is sound,
view your own case in others. Observe, I pray you, the crowds collecting round, and the
angry men like maniacs acting shamefully in the midst. For when the passion boils up
within the breast, and becomes excited and savage, the mouth breathes fire, the eyes emit
fire, all the face becomes swollen, the hands are extended disorderly, the feet dance ridicu-

lously, and they spring at those who restrain them, and differ nothing from madmen in
their insensibility to all these things; nay, differ not from wild asses, kicking and biting.
Truly a passionate man is not a graceful one.</p>
<p>And then, when after this exceedingly ridiculous conduct, they return home and come
to themselves, they have the greater pain, and much fear, thinking who were present when
they were angry. For like raving men, they did not then know the standers by, but when
they have returned to their right mind, then they consider, were they friends? were they foes
and enemies that looked on? And they fear alike about both; the first because they will
condemn them and give them more shame; the others because they will rejoice at it. And
if they have even exchanged blows, then their fear is the more pressing; for instance, lest
anything very grievous happen to the sufferer; a fever follow and bring on death, or a
troublesome swelling rise and place him in danger of the worst. And, “what need” (say they)
“had I of fighting, and violence, and quarreling? Perish such things.” And then they curse
the ill-fated business which caused them to begin, and the more foolish lay on “wicked
spirits,” and “an evil hour,” the blame of what has been done; but these things are not from
an evil hour, (for there is no such thing as an evil hour,) nor from a wicked spirit, but from
the wickedness of those captured by the passion; they draw the spirits to them, and bring
upon themselves all things terrible. “But the heart swells,” says one, “and is stung by insults.”
I know it; and that is the reason why I admire those who master this dreadful wild beast;
yet it is possible if we will, to beat off the passion. For why when our rulers insult us do we
not feel it? It is because fear counterbalances the passion, and frightens us from it, and does
not allow it to spring up at all. And why too do our servants, though insulted by us in ten
thousand ways, bear all in silence? Because they too have the same restraint laid upon them.
And think thou not merely of the fear of God, but that it is even God Himself who then insults
thee, who bids thee be silent, and then thou wilt bear all things meekly, and say to the aggressor,
How can I be angry with thee? there is another that restrains both my hand and my
tongue; and the saying will be a suggestion of sound wisdom, both to thyself and to him.
Even now we bear unbearable things on account of men, and often say to those who have
insulted us, “Such an one insulted me, not you.” Shall we not use the same caution in the
case of God? How else can we hope for pardon? Let us say to our soul, “It is God who holds
our hands, who now insults us; let us not be restive, let not God be less honored by us than
men.” Did ye shudder at the word? I wish you would shudder not at the word only, but at
the deed. For God hath commanded us when buffeted not only to endure it, but even to
offer ourselves to suffer something worse; and we withstand Him with such vehemence,
that we not only refuse to offer ourselves to suffer evil, but even avenge ourselves, nay often
are the first to act on the offensive,101 and think we are disgraced if we do not the same in

return. Yes, and the mischief is, that when utterly worsted we think ourselves conquerors,
and when lying undermost and receiving ten thousand blows from the devil, then we imagine
that we are mastering him. Let us then, I exhort you, understand what is the nature102 of
this victory, and this kind of nature103 let us follow after. To suffer evil is to get the crown.
If then we wish to be proclaimed victors by God, let us not in these contests observe the
laws of heathen games, but those of God, and learn to bear all things with longsuffering; for
so we may get the better of our antagonists, and obtain both present and promised goods,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with
whom to the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, power, and honor, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily V.</head>
<p>John i. 3</p>
<p>“All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Moses in the beginning of the history and writings of the Old Testament speaks to
us of the objects of sense, and enumerates them to us at length. For, “In the beginning,” he
says, “God made the heaven and the earth,” and then he adds, that light was created, and a
second heaven and the stars, the various kinds of living creatures, and, that we may not
delay by going through particulars, everything else. But this Evangelist, cutting all short,
includes both these things and the things which are above these in a single sentence; with
reason, because they were known to his hearers, and because he is hastening to a greater
subject, and has instituted all his treatise, that he might speak not of the works but of the
Creator, and Him who produced them all. And therefore Moses, though he has selected the
smaller portion of the creation, (for he has spoken nothing to us concerning the invisible
powers,) dwells on these things;104 while John, as hastening to ascend to the Creator Himself,
runs by both these things, and those on which Moses was silent, having comprised them in
one little saying, “All things were made by Him.” And that you may not think that he merely
speaks of all the things mentioned by Moses, he adds, that “without Him was not anything
made that was made.” That is to say, that of created things, not one, whether it be visible105
or intelligible106 was brought into being without the power of the Son.</p>
<p>For we will not put the full stop after “not anything,” as the heretics do. They, because
they wish to make the Spirit created, say, “What was made, in Him was Life”; yet so what
is said becomes unintelligible. First, it was not the time here to make mention of the Spirit,
and if he desired to do so, why did he state it so indistinctly? For how is it clear that this
saying relates to the Spirit? Besides, we shall find by this argument, not that the Spirit, but
that the Son Himself, is created by Himself. But rouse yourselves, that what is said may not
escape you; and come, let us read for a while after their fashion, for so its absurdity will be
clearer to us. “What was made, in Him was Life.” They say that the Spirit is called “Life.”
But this “Life” is found to be also “Light,” for he adds, “And the Life was the Light of men.”
( Ver. 4.) Therefore, according to them the “Light of men” here means the Spirit. Well, but
when he goes on to say, that “There was a man sent from God, to bear witness of that Light”
( vers. 6, 7 ), they needs must assert, that this too is spoken of the Spirit; for whom he above
called “Word,” Him as he proceeds he calls “God,” and “Life,” and “Light.” This “Word” he
<note type="footnote">104 i.e. the visible creation.</note>
<note type="footnote">105 ὁ ρατὸν.</note>
<note type="footnote">106 νοητὸν.</note>

<pb n="49"/>
says was “Life,” and this “Life” was “Light.” If now this Word was Life, and if this Word and
this Life became flesh, then the Life, that is to say, the Word, “was made flesh, and we beheld”
Its “glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.” If then they say that the Spirit
is here called “Life,” consider what strange consequences will follow. It will be the Spirit,
not the Son, that was made flesh; the Spirit will be the Only-Begotten Son.</p>
<p>And those who read the passage so will fall, if not into this, yet in avoiding this into
another most strange conclusion. If they allow that the words are spoken of the Son, and
yet do not stop or read as we do, then they will assert that the Son is created by Himself.
Since, if “the Word was Life,” and “what was made in Him was Life”; according to this
reading He is created in Himself and through Himself. Then after some words between, he
has added, “And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.” (
Ver. 14.) See, the Holy Spirit is found, according to the reading of those who assert these
things, to be also an only-begotten Son, for it is concerning Him that all this declaration is
uttered by him. See when the word has swerved107 from the truth, whither it is perverted,
and what strange consequences it produces!</p>
<p>What then, says one, is not the Spirit “Light”? It is Light: but in this place there is no
mention of the Spirit. Since even God (the Father) is called “Spirit,” that is to say, incorporeal,
yet God (the Father) is not absolutely meant wherever “Spirit” is mentioned. And why do
you wonder if we say this of the Father? We could not even say of the Comforter, that
wherever “Spirit” (is mentioned), the Comforter is absolutely meant, and yet this is His
most distinctive name; still not always where Spirit (is mentioned is) the Comforter (meant).
Thus Christ is called “the power of God” ( 1 Cor. i. 24 ), and “the wisdom of God”; yet not
always where “the power” and “the wisdom of God” are mentioned is Christ meant; so in
this passage, although the Spirit does give “Light,” yet the Evangelist is not now speaking
of the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we have shut them out from these strange opinions, they who take all manner
of pains to withstand the truth, say, (still clinging to the same reading,) “Whatever came
into existence108 by him was life, because,” says one, “whatever came into existence was
life.” What then do you say of the punishment of the men of Sodom, and the flood, and hell
fire, and ten thousand like things? “But,” says one, “we are speaking of the material creation.”
109 Well, these too belong entirely to the material creation. But that we may out of
our abundance110 refute their argument, we will ask them, “Is wood, life,” tell me? “Is stone,
<note type="footnote">107 ἐ κκυλίσθη, lit. “been rolled away.”</note>
<note type="footnote">108 γεγονε.</note>
<note type="footnote">109 δημιουργίας.</note>
<note type="footnote">110 ἐ κ περιουσίας.</note>

<pb n="50"/>
life?” these things that are lifeless and motionless? Nay, is man absolutely life? Who would
say so? he is not pure life,111 but is capable of receiving life.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> See here again, an absurdity; by the same succession of consequences we will bring
the argument to such a point, that even hence you may learn their folly. In this way they
assert things by no means befitting of the Spirit. Being driven from their other ground, they
apply those things to men, which they before thought to be spoken worthily of the Spirit.
However, let us examine the reading itself this way also. The creature is now called “life,”
therefore, the same is “light,” and John came to witness concerning it. Why then is not he
also “light”? He says that “he was not that light” ( ver. 8 ), and yet he belonged to created
things? How then is he not “light”? How was he “in the world, and the world was made by
him”? ( Ver. 10.) Was the creature in the creature, and was the creature made by the creature?
But how did “the world know him not”? How did the creature not know the creature? “But
as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” ( Ver. 12.)
But enough of laughter. For the rest I leave it to you to attack these monstrous reasonings,
that we may not seem to have chosen112 to raise a laugh for its own sake, and waste the time
without cause. For if these things are neither said of the Spirit, (and it has been shown that
they are not,) nor of anything created, and yet they still hold to the same reading, that
stranger conclusion than any which we before mentioned, will follow, that the Son was made
by Himself. For if the Son is the true Light, and this Light was Life, and this Life was made
in Him, this must needs be the result according to their own reading. Let us then relinquish
this reading, and come to the recognized reading and explanation.113</p>
<p>And what is that? It is to make the sentence end at “was made,” and to begin the next
sentence with, “In Him was Life.” What (the Evangelist) says is this, “Without Him was not
anything made that was made”; whatever created thing was made, says he, was not made
without Him. See you how by this short addition he has rectified all the besetting114 difficulties;
for the saying, that “without Him was not anything made,” and then the adding,
“which was made,” includes things cognizable by the intellect,115 but excludes the Spirit.
For after he had said that “all things were made by Him,” and “without Him was not anything
made,” he needed this addition, lest some one should say, “If all things were made by Him,
then the Spirit also was made.” “I,” he replies, “asserted that whatever was made was made
by Him, even though it be invisible, or incorporeal, or in the heavens. For this reason, I did

not say absolutely, ‘all things,’ but ‘whatever was made,’ that is, ‘created things,’ but the
Spirit is uncreated.”</p>
<p>Do you see the precision of his teaching? He has alluded to the creation of material
things, (for concerning these Moses had taught before him,) and after bringing us to advance
from thence to higher things, I mean the immaterial and the invisible, he excepts the Holy
Spirit from all creation. And so Paul, inspired by the same grace, said, “For by Him were all
things created.” ( Col. i. 16.) Observe too here again the same exactness. For the same Spirit
moved this soul also. That no one should except any created things from the works of God
because of their being invisible, nor yet should confound the Comforter with them, after
running through the objects of sense which are known to all, he enumerates also things in
the heavens, saying, “Whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers”;
for the expression “whether” subjoined to each, shows to us nothing else but this, that “by
Him all things were made, and without Him was not anything made that was made.”</p>
<p>But if you think that the expression “by”116 is a mark of inferiority, (as making Christ
an instrument,) hear him say, “Thou, Lord, in the beginning, hast laid the foundation of the
earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.” ( Ps. cii. 25.) He says of the Son what is
said of the Father in His character of Creator; which he would not have said, unless he had
deemed of Him as of a Creator, and yet not subservient to any. And if the expression “by
Him” is here used, it is put for no other reason but to prevent any one from supposing the
Son to be Unbegotten. For that in respect of the title of Creator He is nothing inferior to
the Father; hear from Himself, where He saith, “As the Father raiseth up the dead and
quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.” ( c. v. 21.) If now in the Old
Testament it is said of the Son, “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
the earth,” His title of Creator is plain. But if you say that the Prophet spoke this of the
Father, and that Paul attributed to the Son what was said of the Father, even so the conclusion
is the same. For Paul would not have decided that the same expression suited the Son, unless
he had been very confident that between Father and Son there was an equality of honor;
since it would have been an act of extremest rashness to refer what suited an incomparable
Nature to a nature inferior to, and falling short of it. But the Son is not inferior to, nor falls
short of, the Essence of the Father; and therefore Paul has not only dared to use these expressions
concerning Him, but also others like them. For the expression “from Whom,” which
you decide to belong properly to the Father alone, he uses also concerning the Son, when
he says, “from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and
knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.” ( Col. ii. 19.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And he is not content with this only, he stops your mouths in another way also, by
applying to the Father the expression “by whom,” which you say is a mark of inferiority.
<note type="footnote">116 Or, through διὰ.</note>

For he says, “God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son” ( 1
Cor. i. 9 ): and again, “By His will” ( 1 Cor. i. 1 , U+0026c.); and in another place, “For of Him,
and through Him, and to Him, are all things.” ( Rom. xi. 26.) Neither is the expression
“from117 whom,” assigned to the Son only, but also to the Spirit; for the angel said to Joseph,
“Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Ghost.” ( Matt. i. 20.) As also the Prophet does not deem it improper to apply to the Father
the expression “in whom,”118 which belongs to the Spirit, when he says, “In119 God we shall
do valiantly.” ( Ps. lx. 12.) And Paul, “Making request, if by any means now at length I might
have a prosperous journey, in the will of God, to come unto you.” ( Rom. i. 10.) And again
he uses it of Christ, saying, “In Christ Jesus.” ( Rom. vi. 11, 23 , U+0026c.) In short, we may often
and continually find these expressions interchanged; 120 now this would not have taken
place, had not the same Essence been in every instance their subject. And that you may not
imagine that the words, “All things were made by Him,” are in this case used concerning
His miracles, (for the other Evangelists have discoursed concerning these;) he farther goes
on to say, “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him”; (but not the Spirit, for
This is not of the number of created things, but of those above all creation.)</p>
<p>Let us now attend to what follows. John having spoken of the work of creation, that “All
things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made,” goes
on to speak concerning His Providence, where he saith, “In Him was Life.” That no one
may doubt how so many and so great things were “made by Him,” he adds, that “In Him
was Life.” For as with the fountain which is the mother of the great deeps, however much
you take away you nothing lessen the fountain; so with the energy of the Only-Begotten,
however much you believe has been produced and made by it, it has become no whit the
less. Or, to use a more familiar example, I will instance that of light, which the Apostle
himself added immediately, saying, “And the Life was the Light.” As then light, however
many myriads it may enlighten, suffers no diminution of its own brightness; so also God,
before commencing His work and after completing it, remains alike indefectible, nothing
diminished, nor wearied by the greatness of the creation. Nay, if need were that ten thousand,
or even an infinite number of such worlds be created, He remains the same, sufficient for
them all not merely to produce, but also to control them after their creation. For the word
“Life” here refers not merely to the act of creation, but also to the providence (engaged)
about the permanence of the things created; it also lays down beforehand the doctrine of
<note type="footnote">117 ἐ κ.</note>
<note type="footnote">118 ἐ ν ᾧ.</note>
<note type="footnote">119 ἐ ν.</note>
<note type="footnote">120 i.e. applied alike to the different Persons in the Holy Trinity.</note>

<pb n="53"/>
the resurrection, and is the beginning121 of these marvelous good tidings.122 Since when
“life” has come to be with us, the power of death is dissolved; and when “light” has shone
upon us, there is no longer darkness, but life ever abides within us, and death cannot overcome
it. So that what is asserted of the Father might be asserted absolutely of Him (Christ)
also, that “In Him we live and move and have our being.” ( Col. i. 16, 17.) As Paul has shown
when he says, “By Him were all things created,” and “by Him all things consist”; for which
reason He has been called also “Root”123 and “Foundation.”124</p>
<p>But when you hear that “In Him was Life,” do not imagine Him a compound Being,
since farther on he says of the Father also, “As the Father hath Life in Himself, so hath He
given to the Son also to have Life” ( John v. 26 ); now as you would not on account of this
expression say that the Father is compounded, so neither can you say so of the Son. Thus
in another place he says, that “God is Light” ( 1 John i. 5 ), and elsewhere (it is said), that
He “dwelleth in light unapproachable” ( 1 Tim. vi. 16 ); yet these expressions are used not
that we may suppose a compounded nature,125 but that by little and little we may be led up
to the highest doctrines. For since one of the multitude could not easily have understood
how His life was Life Impersonate,126 he first used that humbler expression, and afterwards
leads them (thus) trained to the higher doctrine. For He who had said that “He hath given
Him (the Son) to have life” ( c. v. 26 ); the Same saith in another place, “I am the Life” ( c.
xiv. 6 ); and in another, “I am the Light.” ( c. viii. 12.) And what, tell me, is the nature of this
“light”? This kind (of light) is the object not of the senses, but of the intellect, enlightening
the soul herself. And since Christ should hereafter say, that “None can come unto Me except
the Father draw him” ( c. vi. 44 ); the Apostle has in this place anticipated an objection, and
declared that it is He (the Son) who “giveth light” ( ver. 9 ); that although you hear a saying
like this concerning the Father, you may not say that it belongs to the Father only, but also
to the Son. For, “All things,” He saith, “which the Father hath are Mine.” ( c. xvi. 15.)</p>
<p>First then, the Evangelist hath instructed us respecting the creation, after that he tells
us of the goods relating to the soul which He supplied to us by His coming; and these he
has darkly described in one sentence, when he says, “And the Life was the Light of men.” (
Ver. 4.) He does not say, “was the light of the Jews,” but universally “of men”: nor did the
Jews only, but the Greeks also, come to this knowledge, and this light was a common proffer

made127 to all. “Why did he not add ‘Angels,’ but said, ‘of men’?” Because at present his
discourse is of the nature of men, and to them he came bearing glad tidings of good things.</p>
<p>“And the light shineth in darkness.” ( ver. 5.) He calls death and error, “darkness.” For
the light which is the object of our senses does not shine in darkness, but apart from it; but
the preaching of Christ hath shone forth in the midst of prevailing error, and made it to
disappear. And He by enduring death128 hath so overcome death, that He hath recovered
those already held by it. Since then neither death overcame it, nor error, since it is bright
everywhere, and shines by its proper strength, therefore he says,</p>
<p>“And the darkness comprehended it not.” For it cannot be overcome, and will not dwell
in souls which wish not to be enlightened.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But let it not trouble thee that It took not all, for not by necessity and force, but by
will and consent129 does God bring us to Himself. Therefore do not thou shut thy doors
against this light, and thou shalt enjoy great happiness.130 But this light cometh by faith,
and when it is come, it lighteth abundantly him that hath received it; and if thou displayest
a pure life (meet) for it, remains indwelling within continually. “For,” He saith, “He that
loveth Me, will keep My commandments; and I and My Father will come unto him, and
make Our abode with him.” ( John xiv. 23 ; slightly varied.) As then one cannot rightly enjoy
the sunlight, unless he opens his eyes; so neither can one largely share this splendor, unless
he have expanded the eye of the soul, and rendered it in every way keen of sight.</p>
<p>But how is this effected? Then when we have cleansed the soul from all the passions.
For sin is darkness, and a deep darkness; as is clear, because men do it unconsciously and
secretly. For, “every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light.” ( c. iii.
20.) And, “It is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.” (
Eph. v. 12.) For, as in darkness a man knows neither friend nor foe, but cannot perceive any
of the properties of objects; so too is it in sin. For he who desires to get more gain, makes
no difference between friend and enemy; and the envious regards with hostile eyes the man
with whom he is very intimate; and the plotter is at mortal quarrel with all alike. In short,
as to distinguishing the nature of objects, he who commits sin is no better than men who
are drunk or mad. And as in the night, wood, lead, iron, silver, gold, precious stones, seem
to us all alike on account of the absence of the light which shows their distinctions; so he
who leads an impure life knows neither the excellence of temperance nor the beauty of
philosophy. For in darkness, as I said before, even precious stones if they be displayed do
not show their luster, not by reason of their own nature, but because of the want of discern-

ment in the beholders. Nor is this the only evil which happens to us who are in sin, but this
also, that we live in constant fear: and as men walking in a moonless night tremble, though
none be by to frighten them; so those who work iniquity cannot have confidence, though
there be none to accuse them; but they are afraid of everything, and are suspicious, being
pricked by their conscience: all to them is full of fear and distress,131 they look about them
at everything, are terrified at everything. Let us then flee a life so painful, especially since
after this painfulness shall follow death; a deathless death, for of the punishment in that
place there will be no end; and in this life they (who sin) are no better than madmen, in that
they are dreaming of things that have no existence. They think they are rich when they are
not rich, that they enjoy when they are not enjoying, nor do they properly perceive the cheat
until they are freed from the madness and have shaken off the sleep. Wherefore Paul exhorts
all to be sober, and to watch; and Christ also commands the same. For he who is sober and
awake, although he be captured by sin, quickly beats it off; while he who sleeps and is beside
himself, perceives not how he is held prisoner of it.</p>
<p>Let us then not sleep. This is not the season of night, but of day. Let us therefore “walk
honestly132 as in the day” ( Rom. xiii. 13 ); and nothing is more indecent than sin. In point
of indecency it is not so bad to go about naked as in sin and wrong doing. That is not so
great matter of blame, since it might even be caused by poverty; but nothing has more shame
and less honor than the sinner. Let us think of those who come to the justice-hall on some
account of extortion, or overreaching; 133 how base and ridiculous they appear to all by
their utter shamelessness, their lies, and audacity.134 But we are such pitiable and wretched
beings, that we cannot bear ourselves to put on a garment awkwardly or awry; nay, if we
see another person in this state, we set him right; and yet though we and all our neighbors
are walking on our heads, we do not even perceive it. For what, say, can be more shameful
than a man who goes in to a harlot? what more contemptible than an insolent, a foul-tongued
or an envious man? Whence then is it that these things do not seem so disgraceful as to walk
naked? Merely from habit. To go naked no one has ever willingly endured; but all men are
continually venturing on the others without any fear. Yet if one came into an assembly of
angels, among whom nothing of the sort has ever taken place, there he would clearly see
the great ridicule (of such conduct). And why do I say an assembly of angels? Even in the
very palaces among us, should one introduce a harlot and enjoy her, or be oppressed by
excess of wine, or commit any other like indecency, he would suffer extreme punishment.
But if it be intolerable that men should dare such things in palaces, much more when the

King is everywhere present, and observes what is done, shall we if we dare them undergo

Spirit, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 6</p>
<p>“There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Having in the introduction spoken to us things of urgent importance137 concerning
God the Word, (the Evangelist) proceeding on his road, and in order, afterwards comes to
the herald of the Word, his namesake John. And now that thou hearest that he was “sent
from God,” do not for the future imagine that any of the words spoken by him are mere
man’s words; for all that he utters is not his own, but is of Him who sent him. Wherefore
he is called138 “messenger” ( Mal. iii. 1 ), for the excellence of a messenger is, that he say
nothing of his own. But the expression “was,” in this place is not significative of his coming
into existence, but refers to his office of messenger; for “‘there was’ a man sent from God,”
is used instead of “a man ‘was sent’ from God.”</p>
<p>How then do some say,139 that the expression, “being in the form of God” ( Philip. ii.
6 ) is not used of His invariable likeness140 to the Father, because no article is added?141
For observe, that the article is nowhere added here. Are these words then not spoken of the
Father? What then shall we say to the prophet who says, that, “Behold, I send My messenger
before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way” ( Mal. iii. 1, as found in Mark i. 2 )? for the
expressions “My” and “Thy” declare two Persons.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “The same came for a witness, to bear witness of that Light.”</p>
<p>What is this, perhaps one may say, the servant bear witness to his Master? When then
you see Him not only witnessed to by His servant, but even coming to him, and with Jews
baptized by him, will you not be still more astonished and perplexed? Yet you ought not to
be troubled nor confused, but amazed at such unspeakable goodness. Though if any still
continue bewildered142 and confused, He will say to such an one what He said to John,
“Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness” ( Matt. iii. 15 );
and, if any be still further troubled, again He will say to him too143 what he said to the Jews,
“But I receive not testimony from man.” ( c. v. 34.) If now he needs not this witness, why

was John sent from God? Not as though He required his testimony—this were extremest
blasphemy. Why then? John himself informs us, when he says,</p>
<p>“That all men through him might believe.”</p>
<p>And Christ also, after having said that “I receive not testimony from man” ( c. v. 34 ),
in order that He may not seem to the foolish to clash with144 Himself, by declaring at one
time “There is another that beareth witness of Me and I know that his145 witness is true” (
c. v. 32 ) (for He pointed to John;) and at another, “I receive not testimony from man” ( c.
v. 34 ); He immediately adds the solution of the doubt, “But these things I say” for your own
sake,146 “that ye might be saved.” As though He had said, that “I am God, and the really-
Begotten147 Son of God, and am of that Simple and Blessed Essence, I need none to witness
to Me; and even though none would do so, yet am not I by this anything diminished in My
Essence; but because I care for the salvation of the many,148 I have descended to such humility
as to commit the witness of Me to a man.” For by reason of the groveling nature and
infirmity of the Jews, the faith in Him would in this way be more easily received, and more
palatable.149 As then He clothed Himself with flesh, that he might not, by encountering
men with the unveiled Godhead, destroy them all; so He sent forth a man for His herald,
that those who heard might at the hearing of a kindred voice approach more readily. For
(to prove) that He had no need of that (herald’s) testimony, it would have sufficed that He
should only have shown Himself who He was in His unveiled Essence, and have confounded
them all. But this He did not for the reason I have before mentioned. He would have annihilated150
all, since none could have endured the encounter of that unapproachable light.151
Wherefore, as I said, He put on flesh, and entrusted the witness (of Himself) to one of our
fellow-servants, since He arranged152 all for the salvation of men, looking not only to His
own honor, but also to what might be readily received by, and be profitable to, His hearers.
Which He glanced at when He said, “These things I say” for your sake, “that ye might be
saved.” ( c. v. 34.) And the Evangelist using the same language as his Master, after saying,
“to bear witness of that Light,” adds,</p>
<note type="footnote">144 περιπίπτειν.</note>

<note type="footnote">152 ἐ πραγματεύσατο.</note>

<pb n="59"/>
<p>“That all men through Him might believe.” All but saying, Think not that the reason
why John the Baptist came to bear witness, was that he might add aught to the trustworthiness
of his Master. No; (He came,) that by his means beings of his own class153 might believe.
For it is clear from what follows, that he used this expression in his anxiety to remove this
suspicion beforehand, since he adds,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “He was not that Light.”</p>
<p>Now if he did not introduce this as setting himself against this suspicion, then the expression
is absolutely superfluous, and tautology rather than elucidation of his teaching.
For why, after having said that he “was sent to bear witness of that Light,” does he again say,
“He was not that Light”? (He says it,) not loosely or without reason; but, because, for the
most part, among ourselves, the person witnessing is held to be greater, and generally more
trustworthy than the person witnessed of; therefore, that none might suspect this in the case
of John, at once from the very beginning he removes this evil suspicion, and having torn it
up by the roots, shows who this is that bears witness, and who is He who is witnessed of,
and what an interval there is between the witnessed of, and the bearer of witness. And after
having done this, and shown His incomparable superiority, he afterwards proceeds fearlessly
to the narrative which remains; and after carefully removing whatever strange (ideas) might
secretly harbor154 in the minds of the simpler sort, so instills into all155 easily and without
impediment the word of doctrine in its proper order.</p>
<p>Let us pray then, that henceforth with the revelation of these thoughts and rightness of
doctrine, we may have also a pure life and bright conversation,156 since these things profit
nothing unless good works be present with us. For though we have all faith and all knowledge
of the Scriptures, yet if we be naked and destitute of the protection derived from (holy) living,
there is nothing to hinder us from being hurried into the fire of hell, and burning for ever
in the unquenchable flame. For as they who have done good shall rise to life everlasting, so
they who have dared the contrary shall rise to everlasting punishment, which never has an
end. Let us then manifest all eagerness not to mar the gain which accrues to us from a right
faith by the vileness of our actions, but becoming well-pleasing to Him by these also, boldly
to look on Christ. No happiness can be equal to this. And may it come to pass, that we all
having obtained157 what has been mentioned, may do all to the glory of God; to whom,
with the Only-Begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 9</p>
<p>“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The reason, O children greatly beloved, why we entertain you portion by portion
with the thoughts taken from the Scriptures, and do not at once pour all forth to you, is,
that the retaining what is successively set before you may be easy. For even in building, one
who before the first stones are settled lays on others, constructs158 a rotten wall altogether,
and easily thrown down: while one who waits that the mortar may first get hard, and so
adds what remains little by little, finishes the whole house firmly, and makes it strong, not
one to last for a short time, or easily to fall to pieces. These builders we imitate,159 and in
like manner build up your souls. For we fear lest, while the first foundation is but newly
laid, the addition of the succeeding speculations160 may do harm to the former, through
the insufficiency of the intellect to contain them all at once.</p>
<p>What now is it that has been read to us today?</p>
<p>“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” For
since above in speaking of John he said, that he came “to bear witness of that Light”; and
that he was sent in these our days;161 lest any one at hearing this should, on account of the
recent coming of the witness, conceive some like suspicion concerning Him, who is witnessed
of, he has carried up the imagination, and transported it to that existence which is before
all beginning, which has neither end nor commencement.</p>
<p>“And how is it possible,” says one, “that being a Son, He should possess this (nature)?”
We are speaking of God, and do you ask how? And do you not fear nor shudder? Yet should
any one ask you, “How should our souls and bodies have endless life in the world to
come?162” you will laugh at the question, on the ground that it does not belong to the intellect
of man to search into such questions, but that he ought only to believe, and not to be overcurious
on the subject mentioned, since he has a sufficient proof of the saying, in the power
of Him who spake it. And if we say, that He, who created our souls and bodies, and who
incomparably excels all created things, is without beginning, will you require us to say
“How?” Who could assert this to be the act of a well-ordered soul, or of sound reason? you
have heard that “That was the true Light”: why are you vainly and rashly striving to over-

shoot163 by force of reasoning this Life which is unlimited? You cannot do it. Why seek
what may not be sought? Why be curious about what is incomprehensible? Why search
what is unsearchable? Gaze upon the very source of the sunbeams. You cannot; yet you are
neither vexed nor impatient at your weakness; how then have you become so daring and
headlong in greater matters? The son of thunder, John who sounds164 the spiritual trumpet,
when he had heard from the Spirit the was, enquired no farther. And are you, who share
not in his grace, but speak from your own wretched reasonings, ambitious to exceed the
measure of his knowledge? Then for this very reason you will never be able even to reach
to the measure of his knowledge. For this is the craft of the devil: he leads away those who
obey him from the limits assigned by God, as though to things much greater: but when,
having enticed us by these hopes, he has cast us out of the grace of God, he not only gives
nothing more, (how can he, devil as he is?) but does not even allow us to return again to
our former situation, where we dwelt safely and surely, but leads us about in all directions
wandering and not having any standing ground. So he caused the first created man to be
banished from the abode of Paradise. Having puffed him up with the expectation of greater
knowledge and honor, he expelled him from what he already possessed in security. For he
not only did not become like a god as (the devil) promised him, but even fell beneath the
dominion of death; having not only gained no further advantage by eating of the tree, but
having lost no small portion of the knowledge which he possessed, through hope of greater
knowledge. For the sense of shame, and the desire to hide himself because of his nakedness,
then came upon him, who before the cheat was superior to all such shame; and this very
seeing himself to be naked, and the need for the future of the covering of garments, and
many other infirmities,165 became thenceforth natural to him. That this be not our case, let
us obey God, continue in His commandments, and not be busy about anything beyond
them, that we may not be cast out from the good things already given us. Thus they have
fared (of whom we speak). For seeking to find a beginning of the Life which has no beginning,
they lost what they might have retained. They found not what they sought, (this is impossible,)
and they fell away from the true faith concerning the Only-Begotten.</p>
<p>Let us not then remove the eternal bounds which our fathers set, but let us ever yield
to the laws of the Spirit; and when we hear that “That was the true Light,” let us seek to
discover nothing more. For it is not possible to pass beyond this saying. Had His generation
been like that of a man, needs must there have been an interval between the begetter and
the begotten; but since it is in a manner ineffable and becoming God, give up the “before”

and the “after,” for these are the names of points in time, but the Son is the Creator even of
all ages.166</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “Then,” says one, “He is not Father, but brother.” What need, pray? If we had asserted
that the Father and the Son were from a different root, you might have then spoken this
well. But, if we flee this impiety, and say the Father, besides being without beginning, is
Unbegotten also, while the Son, though without beginning, is Begotten of the Father, what
kind of need that as a consequence of this idea, that unholy assertion should be introduced?
None at all. For He is an Effulgence: but an effulgence is included in the idea of the nature
whose effulgence it is. For this reason Paul has called Him so, that you may imagine no interval
between the Father and the Son. ( Heb. i. 3.) This expression167 therefore is declaratory
of the point; but the following part of the proof quoted, corrects an erroneous opinion which
might beset simple men. For, says the Apostle, do not, because you have heard that he is an
Effulgence, suppose that He is deprived of His proper person; this is impious, and belongs
to the madness of the Sabellians, and of Marcellus’ followers. We say not so, but that He is
also in His proper Person. And for this reason, after having called Him “Effulgence,” Paul
has added that He is “the express image of His Person” ( Heb. i. 3.), in order to make evident
His proper Personality, and that He belongs to the same Essence of which He is also the
express image. For, as I before168 said, it is not sufficient by a single expression to set before
men the doctrines concerning God, but it is desirable that we bring many together, and
choose from each what is suitable. So shall we be able to attain to a worthy telling of His
glory, worthy, I mean, as regards our power; for if any should deem himself able to speak
words suitable to His essential worthiness, and be ambitious to do so, saying, that he knows
God as God knows Himself, he it is who is most ignorant of God.</p>
<p>Knowing therefore this, let us continue steadfastly to hold what “they have delivered
unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word.” ( Luke
i. 2.) And let us not be curious beyond: for two evils will attend those who are sick of this
disease, (curiosity,) the wearying themselves in vain by seeking what it is impossible to find,
and the provoking God by their endeavors to overturn the bounds set by Him. Now what
anger this excites, it needs not that you who know should learn from us. Abstaining therefore
from their madness, let us tremble at His words, that He may continually build us up. For,
“upon whom shall I look” ( Isa. lxvi. 2 , LXX.), saith He, “but upon the lowly, and quiet, and
who feareth my words?” Let us then leave this pernicious curiosity, and bruise our hearts,
let us mourn for our sins as Christ commanded, let us be pricked at heart 169 for our trans-

gressions, let us reckon up exactly all the wicked deeds, which in time past we have dared,
and let us earnestly strive to wipe them off in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Now to this end God hath opened to us many ways. For, “Tell thou first,” saith He, “thy
sins, that thou mayest be justified” ( Isa. xliii. 26170); and again, “I said, I have declared mine
iniquity unto Thee, and Thou hast taken171 away the unrighteousness of my heart” ( Ps.
xxxii. 5 , LXX.); since a continual accusation and remembrance of sins contributes not a
little to lessen their magnitude. But there is another more prevailing way than this; to bear
malice against none of those who have offended against us, to forgive their trespasses to all
those who have trespassed against us. Will you learn a third? Hear Daniel, saying, “Redeem
thy sins by almsdeeds, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.” ( Dan. iv. 27 ,
LXX.) And there is another besides this; constancy in prayer, and persevering attendance
on the intercessions172 made with God. In like manner fasting brings to us some, and that
not small comfort and release from sins committed,173 provided it be attended with kindness
to others, and quenches the vehemence of the wrath of God. ( 1 Tim. ii. 1.) For “water will
quench a blazing fire, and by almsdeeds sins are purged away.” ( Ecclus. iii. 30 , LXX.)</p>
<p>Let us then travel along all these ways; for if we give ourselves wholly to these employments,
if on them we spend our time, not only shall we wash off our bygone transgressions,
but shall gain very great profit for the future. For we shall not allow the devil to assault us
with leisure either for slothful living, or for pernicious curiosity, since by these among other
means, and in consequence of these, he leads us to foolish questions and hurtful disputations,
from seeing us at leisure, and idle, and taking no forethought for excellency of living. But
let us block up this approach against him, let us watch, let us be sober, that having in this
short time toiled a little, we may obtain eternal goods in endless ages, by the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom and with whom to the Father and the Holy
Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

John i. 9</head>
<p>“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Nothing hinders us from handling to-day also the same words, since before we were
prevented by the setting forth of doctrines, from considering all that was read. Where now
are those who deny that He is true God? for here He is called “the true Light” ( c. xiv. 6 ),
and elsewhere very “Truth” and very “Life.” That saying we will discuss more clearly when
we come to the place; but at present we must for a while be speaking to your Charity of that
other matter.</p>
<p>If He “lighteth every man that cometh into the world,” how is it that so many continue
unenlightened? for not all have known the majesty of Christ. How then doth He “light every
man”? He lighteth all as far as in Him lies. But if some, wilfully closing the eyes of their
mind, would not receive the rays of that Light, their darkness arises not from the nature of
the Light, but from their own wickedness, who willfully deprive themselves of the gift. For
the grace is shed forth upon all, turning itself back neither from Jew, nor Greek, nor Barbarian,
nor Scythian, nor free, nor bond, nor male, nor female, nor old, nor young, but admitting
all alike, and inviting with an equal regard. And those who are not willing to enjoy this gift,
ought in justice to impute their blindness to themselves; for if when the gate is opened to
all, and there is none to hinder, any being willfully evil174 remain without, they perish
through none other, but only through their own wickedness.</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “He was in the world.”</p>
<p>But not as of equal duration with the world. Away with the thought. Wherefore he adds,
“And the world was made by Him”; thus leading thee up again to the eternal175 existence
of the Only-Begotten. For he who has heard that this universe is His work, though he be
very dull, though he be a hater, though he be an enemy of the glory of God, will certainly,
willing or unwilling, be forced to confess that the maker is before his works. Whence wonder
always comes over me at the madness of Paul of Samosata, who dared to look in the face so
manifest a truth, and voluntarily threw himself down the preci pice. 176 For he erred not
ignorantly but with full knowledge, being in the same case as the Jews. For as they, looking
to men, gave up sound faith, knowing that he was the only-begotten Son of God, but not
confessing Him, because of their rulers, lest they should be cast out of the synagogue; so it

is said that he, to gratify a certain woman,177 sold his own salvation. A powerful thing,
powerful indeed, is the tyranny of vainglory; it is able to make blind the eyes even of the
wise, except they be sober; for if the taking of gifts can effect this, much more will the yet
more violent feeling of this passion. Wherefore Jesus said to the Jews, “How can ye believe,
which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?”
( c. v. 44 .)</p>
<p>“And the world knew Him not.” By “the world” he here means the multitude, which is
corrupt, and closely attached178 to earthly things, the common179 turbulent, silly people.
For the friends and favorites180 of God all knew Him, even before His coming in the flesh.
Concerning the Patriarch Christ Himself speaks by name, “that your father Abraham rejoiced
to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.” ( c. viii. 56.) And concerning David, confuting
the Jews He said, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, the Lord said unto
my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand.” ( Matt. xxii. 43; Mark xii. 36; Luke xx. 42.) And in
many places, disputing with them, He mentions Moses; and the Apostle (mentions) the rest
of the prophets; for Peter declares, that all the prophets from Samuel knew Him, and proclaimed
beforehand His coming afar off, when he says, “All the prophets from Samuel and
those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.” ( Acts
iii. 24.) But Jacob and his father, as well as his grandfather, He both appeared to and talked
with, and promised that He would give them many and great blessings, which also He
brought to pass.</p>
<p>“How then,” says one, “did He say Himself, ‘Many prophets have desired to see those
things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
have not heard them’? ( Luke x. 24.) Did they then not share in the knowledge of Him?”
Surely they did; and I will endeavor to make this plain from this very saying, by which some
think that they are deprived of it. “For many,” He saith, “have desired to see the things which
ye see.” So that they knew that He would come [to men] from heaven, and would live and
teach181 as He lived and taught; for had they not known, they could have not desired, since
no one can conceive desire for things of which he has no idea; therefore they knew the Son
of Man, and that He would come among men. What then are the things which they did not
hear? What those which they did not know? The things which ye now see and hear. For if
they did hear His voice and did see Him, it was not in the Flesh, not among men; nor when
He was living so familiarly, and conversing so frankly with them.182 And indeed He to show

<pb n="66"/>
this said not simply, “to see” “Me”: but what? “the things which ye see”; nor “to hear” “Me”:
but what? “the things which ye hear.”183 So that if they did not behold His coming in the
Flesh, still they knew that it would be, and they desired it, and believed on Him without
having seen Him in the Flesh.</p>
<p>When therefore the Greeks bring charges such as these against us, and say; “What then
did Christ in former time, that He did not look upon the race of men? And for what possible
reason did He come at last to assist in our salvation, after neglecting us so long?” we will
reply, that before this He was in the world, and took thought for His works, and was known
to all who were worthy. But if ye should say, that, because all did not then know Him, because
He was only known by those noble and excellent persons, therefore He was not acknowledged;
at this rate you will not allow that He is worshiped even now, since even now all
men do not know Him. But as at present no one, because of those who do not know Him,
would refuse credit to those who do, so as regards former times, we must not doubt that He
was known to many, or rather to all of those noble and admirable persons.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And if any one say, “Why did not all men give heed to Him? nor all worship Him,
but the just only?” I also will ask, why even now do not all men know him? But why do I
speak of Christ, when not all men knew His Father then, or know Him now? For some say,
that all things are borne along by chance, while others commit the providence of the universe
to devils. Others invent another God besides Him, and some blasphemously assert, that His
is an opposing power,184 and think that His laws are the laws of a wicked dæmon. What
then? Shall we say that He is not God because there are some who say so? And shall we
confess Him to be evil? for there are some who even so blaspheme Him. Away with such
mental wandering, such utter insanity. If we should delineate185 doctrines according to the
judgment of madmen, there is nothing to hinder us from being mad ourselves with most
grievous madness. No one will assert, looking to those who have weak vision, that the sun
is injurious to the eyes, but he will say that it is fitted to give light, drawing his judgments
from persons in health. And no one will call honey bitter, because it seems so to the sense
of the sick. And will any, from the imaginations of men diseased (in mind) decide that God
either is not, or is evil; or that He sometimes indeed exerts His Providence, sometimes doth
not so at all? Who can say that such men are of sound mind, or deny that they are beside
themselves, delirious, utterly mad?</p>
<note type="footnote">183 al. “for they had both heard His voice, and seen Him, but not in the flesh.”</note>

and other supporters of that heresy.</note>

<p>“The world,” he says, “knew Him not”; but they of whom the world was not worthy
knew Him. And having spoken of those who knew Him not, he in a short time puts the
cause of their ignorance; for he does not absolutely say, that no one knew Him, but that “the
world knew him not”; that is, those persons who are as it were nailed to the world alone,
and who mind the things of the world. For so Christ was wont to call them; as when He
says, “O Holy 186 Father, the world hath not known Thee.” ( c. xvii. 25.) The world then
was ignorant, not only of Him, but also of His Father, as we have said; for nothing so
darkens187 the mind as to be closely attached188 to present things.</p>
<p>Knowing therefore this, remove yourselves from the world, and tear yourselves as much
as possible from carnal things, for the loss which comes to you from these lies not in common
matters, but in what is the chief of goods. For it is not possible for the man who clings
strongly to the things of the present life really189 to lay hold on those in heaven, but he who
is earnest about the one must needs lose the other. “Ye cannot,” He says, “serve God and
Mammon” ( Matt. vi. 24 ), for you must hold to the one and hate the other. And this too
the very experience of the things proclaims aloud. Those, for instance, who deride the lust
of money, are especially the persons who love God as they ought, just as those who respect
that sovereignty (of Mammon), are the men who above all others have the slackest190 love
for Him. For the soul when made captive once for all191 by covetousness, will not easily or
readily refuse doing or saying any of the things which anger God, as being the slave of another
master, and one who gives all his commands in direct opposition to God. Return then
at length to your sober senses, and rouse yourselves, and calling to mind whose servants we
are, let us love His kingdom only; let us weep, let us wail for the times past in which we were
servants of Mammon; let us cast off once for all his yoke so intolerable, so heavy, and continue
to bear the light and easy yoke of Christ. For He lays no such commands upon us as
Mammon does. Mammon bids us be enemies to all men, but Christ, on the contrary, to
embrace and to love all. The one having nailed us192 to the clay and the brickmaking, (for
gold is this,) allows us not even at night to take breath a little; the other releases us from this
excessive and insensate care, and bids us gather treasures in heaven, not by injustice towards
others, but by our own righteousness. The one after our many toils and sufferings is not
able to assist us when we are punished in that place193 and suffer because of his laws, nay,

he increases the flame; the other, though He command us to give but a cup of cold water,
never allows us to lose our reward and recompense even for this, but repays us with great
abundance. How then is it not extremest folly to slight a rule so mild, so full of all good
things, and to serve a thankless, ungrateful tyrant, and one who neither in this world nor
in the world to come is able to help those who obey and give heed to him. Nor is this the
only dreadful thing, nor is this only the penalty, that he does not defend them when they
are being punished; but that besides this, he, as I before said, surrounds those who obey him
with ten thousand evils. For of those who are punished in that place, one may see that the
greater part are punished for this cause, that they were slaves to money, that they loved gold,
and would not assist those who needed. That we be not in this case, let us scatter, let us give
to the poor, let us deliver our souls from hurtful cares in this world, and from the vengeance,
which because of these things is appointed for us in that place. Let us store up righteousness
in the heavens. Instead of riches upon earth, let us collect treasures impregnable, treasures
which can accompany us on our journey to heaven, which can assist us in our peril, and
make the Judge propitious at that hour. Whom may we all have gracious unto us, both now
and at that day, and enjoy with much confidence 194 the good things prepared in the heavens
for those who love Him as they ought, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>“He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> If ye remember our former reflections, we shall the more zealously proceed with
the building up195 of what remains, as doing so for great gain. For so will our discourse be
more intelligible to you who remember what has been already said, and we shall not need
much labor, because you are able through your great love of learning to see more clearly
into what remains. The man who is always losing what is given to him will always need a
teacher, and will never know anything; but he who retains what he has received, and so receives
in addition what remains, will quickly be a teacher instead of a learner, and useful
not only to himself, but to all others also; as, conjecturing from their great readiness to hear,
I anticipate that this assembly will specially be. Come then, let us lay up in your souls, as in
a safe treasury, the Lord’s money, and unfold, as far as the grace of the Spirit may afford us
power, the words this day set before us.</p>
<p>He (St. John) had said, speaking of the old times, that “the world knew him not” ( ver.
10 ); afterwards he comes down in his narrative to the times of the proclamation (of the
Gospel), and says, “He came to His own, and His own received Him not,” now calling the
Jews “His own,” as His peculiar people, or perhaps even all mankind, as created by Him.
And as above, when perplexed at the folly of the many, and ashamed of our common nature,
he said that “the world by Him was made,” and having been made, did not recognize its
Maker; so here again, being troubled beyond bearing196 at the stupidity of the Jews and the
many, he sets forth the charge in a yet more striking manner, saying, that “His own received
Him not,” and that too when “He came to them.” And not only he, but the prophets also,
wondering, said the very same, as did afterwards Paul, amazed at the very same things. Thus
did the prophets cry aloud in the person of Christ, saying, “A people whom I have not
known, have served Me; as soon as they heard Me, they obeyed Me; the strange children
have dealt falsely with Me.197 The strange children have waxed aged, and have halted from
their paths.” ( Ps. xviii. 43–45 , LXX.) And again, “They to whom it had not been told concerning
Him, shall see, and they which had not heard, shall understand.” And, “I was found
of them that sought Me not” ( Isa. lii. 15 ); “I was made manifest unto them that asked not
after me.” ( Isa. xlv. 1, as quoted Rom. x. 20.) And Paul, in his Epistles to the Romans, has
said, “What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for: but the election hath

<note type="footnote">196 δυσανασχετῶν</note>

obtained it.” ( Rom. xi. 7.) And again; “What shall we say then? That the Gentiles which
followed not after righteousness, have attained unto righteousness: but Israel which followed
after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.” ( Rom. ix. 30.)</p>
<p>For it is a thing indeed worthy of our amazement, how they who were nurtured in
(knowledge of) the prophetical books, who heard Moses every day telling them ten thousand
things concerning the coming of the Christ, and the other prophets afterwards, who moreover
themselves beheld Christ Himself daily working miracles among them, giving up His time198
to them alone, neither as yet allowing His disciples to depart into the way of the Gentiles,
or to enter into a city of Samaritans, nor doing so Himself, but everywhere199 declaring that
He was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel ( Matt. x. 5 ): how, (I say), while they saw
the signs, and heard the Prophets, and had Christ Himself continually putting them in remembrance,
they yet made themselves once for all so blind and dull, as by none of these
things to be brought to faith in Christ. ( Matt. xv. 24.) While they of the Gentiles, who had
enjoyed none of these things, who had never heard the oracles of God, not, as one may say,
so much as in a dream, but ever ranging among the fables of madmen, (for heathen philosophy
is this,) having ever in their hands200 the sillinesses of their poets, nailed to stocks
and stones, and neither in doctrines nor in conversation201 possessing anything good or
sound. (For their way of life was more impure and more accursed than their doctrine. As
was likely; for when they saw their gods delighting in all wickedness, worshiped by shameful
words, and more shameful deeds, reckoning this festivity and praise, and moreover honored
by foul murders, and child-slaughters, how should not they emulate these things?) Still,
fallen as they were as low as the very depth of wickedness, on a sudden, as by the agency of
some machine, they have appeared to us shining from on high, and from the very summit
of heaven.</p>
<p>How then and whence came it to pass? Hear Paul telling you. For that blessed person
searching exactly into these things, ceased not until he had found the cause, and had declared
it to all others. What then is it? and whence came such blindness upon the Jews? Hear him
who was entrusted with this stewardship declare. What then does he say in resolving this
doubt of the many? ( 1 Cor. ix. 17.) “For they,” says he, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness
and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
the righteousness of God.” ( Rom. x. 3.) Wherefore they have suffered this. And again, explaining
the same matter in other terms, he says, “What shall we say then? That the Gentiles
which followed not after righteousness, have attained unto righteousness, even the right-

eousness which is of faith; but Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath
not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith.
For they stumbled at that stumbling stone.” ( Rom. ix. 30, 32.) His meaning is this: “These
men’s unbelief has been the cause of their misfortunes, and their haughtiness was parent of
their unbelief.” For when having before enjoyed greater privileges than the heathen,202
through having received the law, through knowing God, and the rest which Paul enumerates,
they after the coming of Christ saw the heathen and themselves called on equal terms through
faith, and after faith received one of the circumcision in nothing preferred to the Gentile,
they came to envy and were stung by their haughtiness, and could not endure the unspeakable
and exceeding lovingkindness of the Lord. So this has happened to them from nothing else
but pride, and wickedness, and unkindness.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For in what, O most foolish of men, are ye injured by the care203 bestowed on others?
How are your blessings made less through having others to share the same? But of a truth
wickedness is blind, and cannot readily perceive anything that it ought. Being therefore
stung by the prospect of having others to share the same confidence,204 they thrust a sword
against themselves, and cast themselves out from the lovingkindness of God. And with good
reason. For He saith, “Friend, I do thee no wrong, I will give to ‘these also’ even as unto
thee.” ( Matt. xx. 14.) Or rather, these Jews are not deserving even of these words. For the
man in the parable if he was discontented, could yet speak of the labors and weariness, the
heat and sweat, of a whole day. But what could these men have to tell? nothing like this, but
slothfulness and profligacy and ten thousand evil things of which all the prophets continued
ever to accuse them, and by which they like the Gentiles had offended against God. And
Paul declaring this says, “For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: being justified freely by His grace.” ( Rom.
x. 12; Rom. iii. 22–24.) And on this head he treats profitably and very wisely throughout
that Epistle. But in a former part of it he proves that they are worthy of still greater punishment.
“For as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law” ( Rom. ii. 12 ); that
is to say, more severely, as having for their accuser the law as well as nature. And not for
this only, but for that they have been the cause that God is blasphemed among the Gentiles:
“My205 Name,” He saith, “is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you.” ( Rom. ii. 24;
Isa. lii. 5.)</p>
<p>Since now this it was that stung them most, (for the thing appeared incredible even to
those of the circumcision who believed, and therefore they brought it as a charge against

Peter, when he was come up to them from Cesarea, that he “went in to men uncircumcised,
and did eat with them” ( Acts xi. 3 ); and after that they had learned the dispensation of
God, even so still206 they wondered how “on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of
the Holy Ghost” ( Acts x. 45 ): showing by their astonishment that they could never have
expected so incredible a thing,) since then he knew that this touched them nearest, see how
he has emptied207 their pride and relaxed208 their highly swelling insolence. For after having
discoursed on the case of the heathen,209 and shown that they had not from any quarter
any excuse, or hope of salvation, and after having definitely charged them both with the
perversion210 of their doctrines and the uncleanness of their lives, he shifts his argument
to the Jews; and211 after recounting all the expressions of the Prophet, in which he had said
that they were polluted, treacherous, hypocritical persons, and had “altogether become unprofitable,”
that there was “none” among them “that seeketh after God,” that they had “all
gone out of the way” ( Rom. iii. 12 ), and the like, he adds, “Now we know that what things
soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
and all the world may become guilty before God.” ( Rom. iii. 19.) “For all have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God.” ( Rom. iii. 23.)</p>
<p>Why then exaltest thou thyself, O Jew? why art thou high minded? for thy mouth also
is stopped, thy boldness also is taken away, thou also with all the world art become guilty,
and, like others, art placed in need of being justified freely. Thou oughtest surely even if
thou hadst stood upright and hadst had great boldness with God, not even so to have envied
those who should be pitied and saved through His lovingkindness. This is the extreme of
wickedness, to pine at the blessings of others; especially when this was to be effected without
any loss of thine. If indeed the salvation of others had been prejudicial to thy advantages,
thy grieving might have been reasonable; though not even then would it have been so to
one who had learned true wisdom.212 But if thy reward is not increased by the punishment
of another, nor diminished by his welfare, why dost thou bewail thyself because that other
is freely saved? As I said, thou oughtest not, even wert thou (one) of the approved, to be
pained at the salvation which cometh to the Gentiles through grace. But when thou, who
art guilty before thy Lord of the same things as they, and hast thyself offended, art displeased
at the good of others, and thinkest great things, as if thou alone oughtest to be partaker of

the grace, thou art guilty not only of envy and insolence, but of extreme folly, and mayest
be liable to all the severest torments; for thou hast planted within thyself the root of all evils,
pride.</p>
<p>Wherefore a wise man has said, “Pride is the beginning of sin” ( Ecclus. x. 13 ): that is,
its root, its source, its mother. By this the first created was banished from that happy abode:
by this the devil who deceived him had fallen from that height of dignity; from which that
accursed one, knowing that the nature of the sin was sufficient to cast down even from
heaven itself, came this way when he labored to bring down Adam from such high honor.
For having puffed him up with the promise that he should be as a God, so he broke him
down, and cast him down into the very gulfs of hell.213 Because nothing so alienates men
from the lovingkindness of God, and gives them over to the fire of the pit,214 as the tyranny
of pride. For when this is present with us, our whole life becomes impure, even though we
fulfill temperance, chastity, fasting, prayer, almsgiving, anything. For, “Every one,” saith
the wise man, “that is proud in heart is an abomination215 to the Lord.” ( Prov. xvi. 5.) Let
us then restrain this swelling of the soul, let us cut up by the roots this lump of pride, if at
least we would wish to be clean, and to escape the punishment appointed for the devil. For
that the proud must fall under the same punishment as that (wicked) one, hear Paul declare;
“Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the judgment, and the snare of the
devil.” 216 What is “the judgment”?217 He means, into the same “condemnation,” the same
punishment. How then does he say, that a man may avoid this dreadful thing? By reflecting
upon218 his own nature, upon the number of his sins, upon the greatness of the torments
in that place, upon the transitory nature of the things which seem bright in this world, differing
in nothing from grass, and more fading than the flowers of spring. If we continually
stir within ourselves these considerations, and keep in mind those who have walked most
upright, the devil, though he strive ten thousand ways, will not be able to lift219 us up, nor
even to trip220 us at all. May the God who is the God of the humble, the good and merciful
God, grant both to you and me a broken and humbled heart, so shall we be enabled easily
to order the rest aright, to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to
the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 11</p>
<p>“He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, God being loving towards man and beneficent, does and contrives all
things in order that we may shine in virtue, and as desiring that we be well approved by
Him. And to this end He draws no one by force or compulsion: but by persuasion and benefits
He draws all that will, and wins them to Himself. Wherefore when He came, some
received Him, and others received Him not. For He will have no unwilling, no forced domestic,
but all of their own will and choice, and grateful to Him for their service. Men, as
needing the ministry of servants, keep many in that state even against their will, by the law
of ownership;221 but God, being without wants, and not standing in need of anything of
ours, but doing all only for our salvation makes us absolute222 in this matter, and therefore
lays neither force nor compulsion on any of those who are unwilling. For He looks only to
our advantage: and to be drawn unwilling to a service like this is the same as not serving at
all.</p>
<p>“Why then,” says one, “does He punish those who will not listen223 to Him, and why
hath He threatened hell to those who endure224 not His commands?” Because, being Good
exceedingly, He cares even for those who obey Him not, and withdraws not from them who
start back and flee from Him. But when we225 had rejected the first way of His beneficence,
and had refused to come by the path of persuasion and kind treatment, then He brought in
upon us the other way, that of correction and punishments; most bitter indeed, but still
necessary, when the former is disregarded.226 Now lawgivers also appoint many and grievous
penalties against offenders, and yet we feel no aversion to them for this; we even honor them
the more on account of the punishments they have enacted, and because though not needing
a single thing that we have, and often not knowing who they should be that should enjoy
the help afforded by their written laws,227 they still took care for the good ordering of our
lives, rewarding those who live virtuously, and checking by punishments the intemperate,

and those228 who would mar the repose229 of others. And if we admire and love these men,
ought we not much more to marvel at and love God on account of His so great care? For
the difference between their and His forethought regarding us is infinite. Unspeakable of a
truth are the riches of the goodness of God, and passing all excess.230 Consider; “He came
to His own,” not for His personal need, (for, as I said, the Divinity is without wants,) but to
do good unto His own people. Yet not even so did His own receive Him, when He came to
His own for their advantage, but repelled Him, and not this only, but they even cast Him
out of the vineyard, and slew Him. Yet not for this even did He shut them out from repentance,
but granted them, if they had been willing, after such wickedness as this, to wash off
all their transgressions by faith in Him, and to be made equal to those who had done no
such thing, but are His especial friends. And that I say not this at random, or for persuasion’s
sake, all the history of the blessed Paul loudly declares. For when he, who after the Cross
persecuted Christ, and had stoned His martyr Stephen by those many hands, repented, and
condemned his former sins, and ran to Him whom he had persecuted, He immediately enrolled
him among His friends, and the chiefest of them, having appointed him a herald and
teacher of all the world, who had been “a blasphemer, and persecutor, and injurious.” ( 1
Tim. i. 13.) Even as he rejoicing at the lovingkindness of God, has proclaimed aloud, and
has not been ashamed, but having recorded in his writings, as on a pillar, the deeds formerly
dared by him, has exhibited them to all; thinking it better that his former life should be
placarded231 in sight of all, so that the greatness of the free gift of God might appear, than
that he should obscure His ineffable and indescribable lovingkindness by hesitating to
parade232 before all men his own error. Wherefore continually233 he treats of his persecution,
his plottings, his wars against the Church, at one time saying, “I am not meet to be called
an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God” ( 1 Cor. xv. 9 ); at another, “Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” ( 1 Tim. i. 15.) And again, “Ye have
heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I
persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.” ( Gal. i. 13.)</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For making as it were a kind of return to Christ for His longsuffering towards him,
by showing who it was, what a hater and enemy that He saved, he declared with much
openness the warfare which at the first with all zeal he warred against Christ; and with this
he holds forth good hopes to those who despaired of their condition. For he says, that Christ

<note type="footnote">230 al. “beyond all thought.”</note>

accepted him, in order that in him first He “might show forth all longsuffering” ( 1 Tim. i.
16 ), and the abundant riches of His goodness, “for a pattern to them that should hereafter
believe in Him to life everlasting.” Because the things which they had dared were too great
for any pardon which the Evangelist declaring, said,</p>
<p>“He came to His own, and His own received Him not.” When0ce came He, who filleth
all things, and who is everywhere present? What place did He empty of His presence, who
holdeth and graspeth all things in His hand? He exchanged not one place for another; how
should He? But by His coming down to us He effected this. For since, though being in the
world, He did not seem to be there, because He was not yet known, but afterwards manifested
Himself by deigning to take upon Him our flesh, he (St. John) calls this manifestation and
descent “a coming.”234 One might wonder at235 the disciple who is not ashamed of the
dishonor of his Teacher, but even records the insolence which was used towards Him: yet
this is no small proof of his truth-loving disposition. And besides, he who feels shame should
feel it for those who have offered an insult, not for the person outraged.236 Indeed He by
this very thing shone the brighter, as taking, even after the insult, so much care for those
who had offered it; while they appeared ungrateful and accursed in the eyes of all men, for
having rejected Him who came to bring them so great goods, as hateful to them, and an
enemy. And not only in this were they hurt, but also in not obtaining what they obtained
who received Him. What did these obtain?</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God,”
says the Evangelist. “Why then, O blessed one, dost thou not also tell us the punishment of
them who received Him not? Thou hast said that they were ‘His own,’ and that when ‘He
came to His own, they received Him not’; but what they shall suffer for this, what punishment
they shall undergo, thou hast not gone on to add. Yet so thou wouldest the more have terrified
them, and have softened the hardness of their insanity by threatening. Wherefore then hast
thou been silent?” “And what other punishment,” he would say, “can be greater than this,
that when power is offered them to become sons of God, they do not become so, but willingly
deprive themselves of such nobility and honor as this?” Although their punishment shall
not even stop at this point, that they gain no good, but moreover the unquenchable fire shall
receive them, as in going on he has more plainly revealed. But for the present he speaks of
the unutterable goods of those who received Him, and sets these words in brief before us,237
saying, “As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God.”

<pb n="77"/>
female or male, children or old men, in honor or dishonor, rich or poor, rulers or private
persons, all, He saith, are deemed worthy the same privilege; for faith and the grace of the
Spirit, removing the inequality caused by worldly things, hath moulded all to one fashion,
and stamped them with one impress, the King’s. What can equal this lovingkindness? A
king, who is framed of the same clay with us, does not deign to enrol among the royal host
his fellow-servants, who share the same nature with himself, and in character often are
better than he, if they chance to be slaves; but the Only-Begotten Son of God did not disdain
to reckon among the company of His children both publicans, sorcerers, and slaves, nay,
men of less repute and greater poverty than these, maimed in body, and suffering from ten
thousand ills. Such is the power of faith in Him, such the excess of His grace. And as the
element of fire, when it meets with ore from the mine, straightway of earth makes it gold,
even so and much more Baptism makes those who are washed to be of gold instead of clay;
the Spirit at that time falling like fire into our souls, burning up the “image of the earthy” (
1 Cor. xv. 49 ), and producing “the image of the heavenly,” fresh coined, bright and glittering,
as from the furnace-mould.</p>
<p>Why then did he say not that “He made them sons of God,” but that “He gave them
power to become sons of God”? To show that we need much zeal to keep the image of sonship
impressed on us at Baptism, all through without spot or soil238 ; and at the same time to
show that no one shall be able to take this power from us, unless we are the first to deprive
ourselves of it. For if among men, those who have received the absolute control of any
matters have well-nigh as much power as those who gave them the charge; much more shall
we, who have obtained such honor from God, be, if we do noth ing unworthy of this power,
stronger than all; because He who put this honor in our hands is greater and better than all.
At the same time too he wishes to show, that not even does grace come upon man irrespectively,
239 but upon those who desire and take pains for it. For it lies in the power of these to
become (His) children since if they do not themselves first make the choice, the gift does
not come upon them, nor have any effect.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Having therefore everywhere excluded compulsion and pointing to (man’s) voluntary
choice and free power, he has said the same now. For even in these mystical blessings,240 it
is, on the one hand, God’s part, to give the grace, on the other, man’s to supply faith; and
in after time there needs for what remains much earnestness. In order to preserve our purity,
it is not sufficient for us merely to have been baptized and to have believed, but we must if
we will continually enjoy this brightness, display a life worthy of it. This then is God’s work
in us. To have been born the mystical Birth, and to have been cleansed from all our former

<note type="footnote">239 ἀ πλῶς.</note>
<note type="footnote">240 i.e. of Baptism.</note>

<pb n="78"/>
sins, comes from Baptism; but to remain for the future pure, never again after this to admit
any stain belongs to our own power and diligence. And this is the reason why he reminds
us of the manner of the birth, and by comparison with fleshly pangs shows its excellence,
when he says,</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Who were born, not of blood,241 nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.” This
he has done, in order that, considering the vileness, and lowness of the first birth, which is
“of blood,” and “the will of the flesh,” and perceiving the highness and nobleness of the
second, which is by grace, we may form from thence some great opinion of it, and one
worthy of the gift of Him who hath begotten us, and for the future exhibit much earnestness.</p>
<p>For there is no small fear, lest, having sometime defiled that beautiful robe by our after
sloth and transgressions, we be cast out from the inner room242 and bridal chamber, like
the five foolish virgins, or him who had not on a wedding garment. ( Matt. xxv.; Matt. xxii.)
He too was one of the guests, for he had been invited; but because, after the invitation and
so great an honor, he behaved with insolence towards Him who had invited him, hear what
punishment he suffers, how pitiable, fit subject for many tears. For when he comes to partake
of that splendid table, not only is he forbidden the least, but bound hand and foot alike, is
carried into outer darkness, to undergo eternal and endless wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Therefore, beloved, let not us either expect243 that faith is sufficient to us for salvation; for
if we do not show forth a pure life, but come clothed with garments unworthy of this blessed
calling, nothing hinders us from suffering the same as that wretched one. It is strange that
He, who is God and King, is not ashamed of men who are vile, beggars, and of no repute,
but brings even them of the cross ways to that table; while we manifest so much insensibility,
as not even to be made better by so great an honor, but even after the call remain in our old
wickedness, insolently abusing244 the unspeakable lovingkindness of Him who hath called
us. For it was not for this that He called us to the spiritual and awful communion of His
mysteries, that we should enter with our former wickedness; but that, putting off our filthiness,
we should change our raiment to such as becomes those who are entertained in palaces.
But if we will not act worthily of that calling this no longer rests with Him who hath honored
us, but with ourselves; it is not He that casts us out from that admirable company of guests,
but we cast out ourselves.</p>
<p>He has done all His part. He has made the marriage, He has provided the table, He has
sent men to call us, has received us when we came, and honored us with all other honor;
but we, when we have offered insult to Him, to the company, and to the wedding, by our

<note type="footnote">243 al. “think.”</note>
<note type="footnote">244 ἐ μπαροινοῦντας.</note>

<pb n="79"/>
filthy garments, that is, our impure actions, are then with good cause cast out. It is to honor
the marriage and the guests, that He drives off those bold245 and shameless persons; for
were He to suffer those clothed in such a garment, He would seem to be offering insult to
the rest. But may it never be that one, either of us or of other, find this of Him who has called
us! For to this end have all these things been written before they come to pass, that we, being
sobered by the threats of the Scriptures, may not suffer this disgrace and punishment to go
on to the deed, but stop it at the word only, and each with bright apparel come to that call;
which may it come to pass that we all enjoy, through the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 14</p>
<p>“And the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> I desire to ask one favor of you all, before I touch on the words of the Gospel; do
not you refuse my request, for I ask nothing heavy or burdensome, nor, if granted, will it
be useful only to me who receive, but also to you who grant it, and perhaps far more so to
you. What then is it that I require of you? That each of you take in hand that section of the
Gospels which is to be read among you on the first day of the week, or even on the Sabbath,
and before the day arrive, that he sit down at home and read it through, and often carefully
consider its contents, and examine all its parts well, what246 is clear, what obscure,247 what
seems to make for the adversaries,248 but does not really so; and when you have tried,249 in
a word250 every point, so go to hear it read. For from zeal like this will be no small gain both
to you and to us. We shall not need much labor to render clear the meaning of what is said,
because your minds will be already made familiar with the sense of the words, and you will
become keener and more clear-sighted not for hearing only, nor for learning, but also for
the teaching of others. Since, in the way that now most of those who come hither hear,
compelled to take in the meaning of all at once, both the words, and the remarks we make
upon them, they will not, though we should go on doing this for a whole year, reap any great
gain. How can they, when they have leisure for what is said as a bywork,251 and only in this
place, and for this short time? If any lay the fault on business, and cares, and constant occupation
in public and private matters, in the first place, this is no slight charge in itself, that
they are surrounded with such a multitude of business, are so continually nailed to the things
of this life, that they cannot find even a little leisure for what is more needful than all. Besides,
that this is a mere pretext and excuse, their meetings with friends would prove against them,
their loitering in the theaters, and the parties252 they make to see horse races, at which they
often spend whole days, yet never in that case does one of them complain of the pressure
of business. For trifles then you can without making any excuses, always find abundant
leisure; but when you ought to attend to the things of God, do these seem to you so utterly

superfluous and mean, that you think you need not assign even a little leisure to them? How
do men of such disposition deserve to breathe or to look upon this sun?</p>
<p>There is another most foolish excuse of these sluggards; that they have not the books
in their possession. Now as to the rich, it is ludicrous that we should take our aim at253 this
excuse; but because I imagine that many of the poorer sort continually use it, I would gladly
ask, if every one of them does not have all the instruments of the trade which he works at,
full and complete, though infinite254 poverty stand in his way? Is it not then a strange thing,
in that case to throw no blame on poverty, but to use every means that there be no obstacle
from any quarter, but, when we might gain such great advantage, to lament our want of
leisure and our poverty?</p>
<p>Besides, even if any should be so poor, it is in their power, by means of the continual
reading of the holy Scriptures which takes place here, to be ignorant of nothing contained
in them. Or if this seems to you impossible, it seems so with reason; for many do not come
with fervent zeal to hearken to what is said, but having done this one thing255 for form’s
sake256 on our account,257 immediately return home. Or if any should stay, they are no
better disposed than those who have retired, since they are only present here with us in
body. But that we may not overload you with accusations, and spend all the time in finding
fault, let us proceed to the words of the Gospel, for it is time to direct the remainder of our
discourse to what is set before us. Rouse yourselves therefore, that nothing of what is said
escape you.</p>
<p>“And the Word was made Flesh,” he saith, “and dwelt among us.”</p>
<p>Having declared that they who received Him were “born of God,” and had become
“sons of God,” he adds the cause and reason of this unspeakable honor. It is that “the Word
became Flesh,” that the Master took on Him the form of a servant. For He became Son of
man, who was God’s own258 Son, in order that He might make the sons of men to be children
of God. For the high when it associates with the low touches not at all its own honor, while
it raises up the other from its excessive lowness; and even thus it was with the Lord. He in
nothing diminished His own Nature by this condescension,259 but raised us, who had always
sat in disgrace and darkness, to glory unspeakable. Thus it may be, a king, conversing with
interest and kindness with a poor mean man, does not at all shame himself, yet makes the

other observed by all and illustrious. Now if in the case of the adventitious dignity of men,
intercourse with the humbler person in nothing injures the more honorable, much less can
it do so in the case of that simple and blessed Essence which has nothing adventitious, or
subject to growth or decay, but has260 all good things immovable, and fixed for ever. So that
when you hear that “the Word became Flesh,” be not disturbed nor cast down. For that
Essence did not change261 to flesh, (it is impiety262 to imagine this,) but continuing what
it is, It so took upon It the form of a servant.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Wherefore then does he use the expression, “was made”? To stop the mouths of the
heretics. For since there are some263 who say that all the circumstances of the Dispensation
were an appearance, a piece of acting, an allegory, at once to remove beforehand their blasphemy,
he has put “was made”; desiring to show thereby not a change of substance, (away
with the thought,) but the assumption of very flesh. For as when (Paul) says, “Christ hath
redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,” he does not mean that
His essence removing from Its proper glory took upon It the being264 of an accursed thing,
(this not even devils could imagine, nor even the very foolish, nor those deprived of their
natural understanding, such impiety as well as madness does it contain,) as (St. Paul) does
not say this, but that He, taking upon Himself the curse pronounced against us, leaves us
no more under the curse; so also here he (St. John) says that He “was made Flesh,” not by
changing His Essence to flesh, but by taking flesh to Himself, His Essence remained untouched.</p>
<p>If they say that being God, He is Omnipotent, so that He could lower Himself265 to the
substance of flesh, we will reply to them, that He is Omnipotent as long as He continues to
be God. But if He admit of change, change for the worse, how could He be God? for change
is far from that simple Nature. Wherefore the Prophet saith, “They all shall wax old as doth
a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but Thou
art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.” ( Ps. cii. 27 , LXX.) For that Essence is superior
to all change. There is nothing better than He, to which He might advance and reach. Better
do I say? No, nor equal to, nor the least approaching Him. It remains, therefore, that if He
change, He must admit a change for the worse; and this would not be God. But let the
blasphemy return upon the heads of those who utter it. Nay, to show that he uses the expres-

sion,’“was made” only that you should not suppose a mere appearance, hear from what
follows how he clears the argument, and overthrows that wicked suggestion. For what does
he add? “And dwelt among us.” All but saying, “Imagine nothing improper from the word
‘was made’; I spoke not of any change of that unchangeable Nature, but of Its dwelling266
and inhabiting. But that which dwells267 cannot be the same with that in which it dwells,
but different; one thing dwells in a different thing, otherwise it would not be dwelling; for
nothing can inhabit itself. I mean, different as to essence; for by an Union268 and Conjoining269
God the Word and the Flesh are One, not by any confusion or obliteration of substances,
but by a certain union ineffable, and past270 understanding. Ask not how271 ; for
It was made, so as He knoweth.”</p>
<p>What then was the tabernacle in which He dwelt? Hear the Prophet say; “I will raise up
the tabernacle of David that is fallen.” ( Amos ix. 11.) It was fallen indeed, our nature had
fallen an incurable fall, and needed only that mighty Hand. There was no possibility of
raising it again, had not He who fashioned it at first stretched forth to it His Hand, and
stamped it anew with His Image, by the regeneration of water and the Spirit. And observe
I pray you, the awful and ineffable nature272 of the mystery. He inhabits this tabernacle for
ever, for He clothed Himself with our flesh, not as again to leave it, but always to have it
with Him. Had not this been the case, He would not have deemed it worthy of the royal
throne, nor would He while wearing it have been worshiped by all the host of heaven, angels,
archangels, thrones, principalities, dominions, powers. What word, what thought can represent
such great honor done to our race, so truly marvelous and awful? What angel, what
archangel? Not one in any place, whether in heaven, or upon earth. For such are the mighty
works273 of God, so great and marvelous are His benefits, that a right description of them
exceeds not only the tongue of men, but even the power of angels.</p>
<p>Wherefore we will274 for a while close our discourse, and be silent; only delivering to
you this charge,275 that you repay this our so great Benefactor by a return which again shall
bring round to us all profit. The return is, that we look with all carefulness to the state of

our souls. For this too is the work of His lovingkindness, that He who stands in no need of
anything of ours says that He is repaid when we take care of our own souls. It is therefore
an act of extremist folly, and one deserving ten thousand chastisements, if we, when such
honor has been lavished upon us, will not even contribute what we can, and that too when
profit comes round to us again by these means, and ten thousand blessings are laid before
us on these conditions. For all these things let us return276 glory to our merciful God, not
by words only, but much more by works that we may obtain the good things hereafter,
which may it be that we all attain to, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

John i. 14</head>
<p>“And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Perhaps we seemed to you the other day277 needlessly hard upon you and burdensome,
using too sharp language, and extending too far our reproaches against the sluggishness
of the many. Now if we had done this merely from a desire to vex you, each of you would
with cause have been angry; but if, looking to your advantage, we neglected in our speech
what might gratify you, if ye will not give us credit for our forethought, you should at least
pardon us on account of such tender love.278 For in truth we greatly fear, lest, if we are
taking pains,279 and you are not willing to manifest the same diligence in listening your
future reckoning may be the more severe. Wherefore we are compelled continually to arouse
and waken you, that nothing of what is said may escape280 you. For so you will be enabled
to live for the present with much confidence, and to exhibit it at that Day before the judgment-
seat of Christ. Since then we have lately sufficiently touched you, let us to-day at the
outset enter on the expressions themselves.</p>
<p>“We beheld,” he says, “His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.”</p>
<p>Having declared that we were made “sons of God,” and having shown in what manner,281
namely, by the “Word” having been “made Flesh,” he again mentions another advantage
which we gain from this same circumstance. What is it? “We beheld His glory, the glory as
of the Only-Begotten of the Father”; which we could not have beheld, had it not been shown
to us, by means of a body like to our own.282 For if the men of old time could not even bear
to look upon the glorified countenance of Moses, who partook of the same nature with us,
if that just man needed a veil which might shade over the purity283 of his glory, and show
to them the face of their prophet mild and gentle;284 how could we creatures of clay and
earth have endured the unveiled Godhead, which is unapproachable even by the powers

above? Wherefore He tabernacled285 among us, that we might be able with much fearlessness
to approach Him, speak to, and converse with Him.</p>
<p>But what means “the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father”? Since many of the
Prophets too were glorified, as this Moses himself, Elijah, and Elisha, the one encircled by
the fiery chariot ( 2 Kings vi. 17 ), the other taken up by it; and after them, Daniel and the
Three Children, and the many others who showed forth wonders286 ; and angels who have
appeared among men, and partly disclosed287 to beholders the flashing light of their proper
nature; and since not angels only, but even the Cherubim were seen by the Prophet in great
glory, and the Seraphim also: the Evangelist leading us away from all these, and removing
our thoughts from created things, and from the brightness of our fellow-servants, sets us at
the very summit of good. For, “not of prophet,” says288 he, “nor angel, nor archangel, nor
of the higher power, nor of any other created nature,” if other there be, but of the Master
Himself, the King Himself, the true Only-Begotten Son Himself, of the Very Lord289 of all,
did we “behold the glory.”</p>
<p>For the expression “as,” does not in this place belong to similarity or comparison, but
to confirmation and unquestionable definition; as though he said, “We beheld glory, such
as it was becoming, and likely that He should possess, who is the Only-Begotten and true
Son of God, the King of all.” The habit (of so speaking) is general, for I shall not refuse to
strengthen my argument even from common custom, since it is not now my object to speak
with any reference to beauty of words, or elegance of composition, but only for your advantage;
and therefore there is nothing to prevent my establishing my argument by the instance
of a common practice. What then is the habit of most persons? Often when any have seen
a king richly decked, and glittering on all sides with precious stones, and are afterwards
describing to others the beauty, the ornaments, the splendor, they enumerate as much as
they can, the glowing tint of the purple robe, the size of the jewels, the whiteness of the
mules, the gold about the yoke, the soft and shining couch. But when after enumerating
these things, and other things besides these, they cannot, say what they will, give a full idea
of290 the splendor, they immediately bring in: “But why say much about it; once for all, he
was like a king;” not desiring by the expression “like,” to show that he, of whom they say
this, resembles a king, but that he is a real king. Just so now the Evangelist has put the word
as, desiring to represent the transcendent nature and incomparable excellence of His glory.</p>

<p>For indeed all others, both angels and archangels and prophets, did everything as under
command; but He with the authority which becomes a King and Master; at which even the
multitudes wondered, that He taught as “one having authority.” ( Matt. vii. 29.) Even angels,
as I said, have appeared with great glory upon the earth; as in the case of Daniel, of David,
of Moses, but they did all as servants who have a Master. But He as Lord and Ruler of all,
and this when He appeared in poor and humble form; but even so creation recognized her
Lord. Now the star from heaven which called the wise men to worship Him, the vast throng
pouring everywhere of angels attending the Lord,291 and hymning His praise, and besides
them, many other heralds sprang up on a sudden, and all, as they met,292 declared to one
another the glad tidings of this ineffable mystery; the angels to the shepherds; the shepherds
to those of the city; Gabriel to Mary and Elisabeth; Anna and Simeon to those who came to
the Temple. Nor were men and women only lifted up293 with pleasure, but the very infant
who had not yet come forth to light, I mean the citizen of the wilderness, the namesake of
this Evangelist, leaped while yet in his mother’s womb, and all were soaring294 with hopes
for the future. This too immediately after the Birth. But when He had manifested Himself
still farther, other wonders, yet greater than the first, were seen. For it was no more star, or
sky, no more angels, or archangels, not Gabriel, or Michael, but the Father Himself from
heaven above, who proclaimed Him, and with the Father the Comforter, flying down at the
uttering of the Voice and resting on Him. Truly therefore did he say, “We beheld His glory,
the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Yet he says it not only on account of these things, but also on account of what followed
them; for no longer do shepherds only, and widow women, and aged men, declare
to us the good tidings, but the very voice295 of the things themselves, sounding clearer than
any trumpet, and so loudly, that the sound was straightway heard even in this land. “For,”
says one, “his fame went into296 all Syria” ( Matt. iv. 24 ); and He revealed Himself to all,
and all things everywhere exclaimed, that the King of Heaven was come. Evil spirits everywhere
fled and started away from Him, Satan covered his face297 and retired, death298 at
that time retreated before Him, and afterwards disappeared altogether; every kind of infirmity
was loosed, the graves let free the dead, the devils those whom they had maddened,299 and

diseases the sick. And one might see things strange and wonderful, such as with good cause
the prophets desired to see, and saw not. One might see eyes fashioned ( John ix. 6, 7 ),
(might see) Him showing to all in short space and on the more noble portion of the body,
that admirable thing which all would have desired to see, how God formed Adam from the
earth; palsied and distorted limbs fastened and adapted to each other, dead hands moving,
palsied feet leaping amain, ears that were stopped re-opened, and the tongue sounding aloud
which before was tied by speechlessness. For having taken in hand the common nature of
men, as some excellent workman might take a house decayed by time, He filled up what
was broken off, banded together its crevices and shaken portions, and raised up again what
was entirely fallen down.</p>
<p>And what should one say of the fashioning of the soul, so much more admirable than
that of the body? The health of our bodies is a great thing, but that of our souls is as much
greater as the soul is better than the body. And not on this account only, but because our
bodily nature follows withersoever the Creator will lead it, and there is nothing to resist,
but the soul being its own mistress, and possessing power over its acts, does not in all things
obey God, unless it will to do so. For God will not make it beautiful and excellent, if it be
reluctant and in a manner constrained by force, for this is not virtue at all; but He must
persuade it to become so of its own will and choice. And so this cure is more difficult than
the other; yet even this succeeded, and every kind of wickedness was banished. And as He
re-ordered the bodies which He cured, not to health only, but to the highest vigor, so did
He not merely deliver the souls from extremist wickedness, but brought them to the very
summit of excellence. A publican became an Apostle, and a persecutor, blasphemer, and
injurious, appeared as herald to the world, and the Magi became teachers of the Jews, and
a thief was declared a citizen of Paradise, and a harlot shone forth by the greatness of her
faith, and of the two women, of Canaan and Samaria, the latter who was another harlot,
undertook to preach the Gospel to her countrymen, and having enclosed a whole city in
her net,300 so brought them301 to Christ; while the former by faith and perseverance, procured
the expulsion of an evil spirit from her daughter’s soul; and many others much worse
than these were straightway numbered in the rank of disciples, and at once all the infirmities302
of their bodies and diseases of their souls were transformed, and they were fashioned
anew to health and exactest virtue. And of these, not two or three men, not five, or ten, or
twenty, or an hundred only, but entire cities and nations, were very easily remodeled. Why
should one speak of the wisdom of the commands, the excellency of the heavenly laws, the
good ordering of the angelic polity? For such a life hath He proposed to us, such laws ap-
<note type="footnote">300 σαγηνεύσασα from σαγήνη, “a seine net.”</note>
<note type="footnote">301 al. “brought them out.”</note>
<note type="footnote">302 πάθη.</note>

<pb n="89"/>
pointed for us, such a polity established, that those who put these things into practice, immediately
become angels and like to God, as far as is in our power, even though they303 may
have been worse than all men.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> The Evangelist therefore having brought together all these things, the marvels in
our bodies, in our souls, in the elements304 (of our faith), the commandments, those gifts
ineffable and higher than the heavens, the laws, the polity, the persuasion, the future
promises, His sufferings, uttered that voice so wonderful and full of exalted doctrine, saying,
“We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth.” For we admire Him not only on account of the miracles, but also by reason of the
sufferings; as that He was nailed upon the Cross, that He was scourged, that He was buffeted,
that He was spit upon, that He received blows on the cheek from those to whom He had
done good. For even of those very things which seem to be shameful, it is proper to repeat
the same expression, since He Himself called that action305 “glory.” For what then took
place was (proof) not only of kindness and love, but also of unspeakable power. At that time
death was abolished, the curse was loosed, devils were shamed and led in triumph and made
a show of, and the handwriting of our sins was nailed to the Cross. And then, since these
wonders were doing invisibly, others took place visibly, showing that He was of a truth the
Only-Begotten Son of God, the Lord of all creation. For while yet that blessed Body hung
upon the tree, the sun turned away his rays, the whole earth was troubled and became dark,
the graves were opened, the ground quaked, and an innumerable multitude of dead leaped
forth, and went into the city. And while the stones of His tomb were fastened upon the vault,
and the seals yet upon them, the Dead arose, the Crucified, the nail-pierced One, and306
having filled His eleven disciples with His mighty307 power, He sent them to men
throughout all the world, to be the common healers of all their kind,308 to correct their way
of living, to spread through every part of the earth the knowledge of their heavenly doctrines,
to break down the tyranny of devils, to teach those great and ineffable blessings, to bring to
us the glad tidings of the soul’s immortality, and the eternal life of the body, and rewards
which are beyond conception, and shall never have an end. These things then, and yet more
than these, the blessed Evangelist having in mind, things which though he knew, he was not
able to write, because the world could not have contained them (for if all things “should be
written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that

should be written”— c. xxi. 25 ), reflecting therefore on all these, he cries out, “We beheld
His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”</p>
<p>It behooves therefore those who have been deemed worthy to see and to hear such
things, and who have enjoyed so great a gift, to display also a life worthy of the doctrines,
that they may enjoy also the good things which are (laid up) there. For our Lord Jesus Christ
came, not only that we might behold His glory here, but also that which shall be. For
therefore He saith, “I will that these309 also be with Me where I am, that they may behold
My glory.” ( c. xvii. 24.) Now if the glory here was so bright and splendid, what can one say
of that (which shall be)? for it shall appear not on this corruptible earth, nor while we are
in perishable bodies, but in a creation which is imperishable, and waxes not old, and with
such brightness as it is not possible even to represent in words. O310 blessed, thrice blessed,
yea many times so, they who are deemed worthy to be beholders of that glory! It is concerning
this that the prophet says, “Let the unrighteous be taken away, that he behold not the glory
of the Lord.” ( Isa. xxvi. 10 , LXX.) God grant that not one of us be taken away nor excluded
ever from beholding it. For if we shall not hereafter enjoy it, then it is time to say of ourselves,
“Good were it for” us, “if” we “had never been born.” For why do we live and breathe? What
are we, if we fail of that spectacle, if no one grant us then to behold our Lord? If those who
see not the light of the sun endure a life more bitter than any death, what is it likely that
they who are deprived of that light must suffer? For in the one case the loss is confined to
this one privation; but in the other it does not rest here, (though if this were the only thing
to be dreaded, even then the degrees of punishment would not be equal, but one would be
as much severer than the other, as that sun is incomparably superior to this,) but now we
must look also for other vengeance; for he who beholds not that light must not only be led
into darkness, but must be burned continually, and waste away, and gnash his teeth, and
suffer ten thousand other dreadful things. Let us then not permit ourselves by making this
brief time a time of carelessness and remissness, to fall into everlasting punishment, but let
us watch and be sober, let us do all things, and make it all our business to attain to that felicity,
and to keep far from that river of fire, which rushes with a loud roaring before the terrible
judgment seat. For he who has once been cast in there, must remain for ever; there is no
one to deliver him from his punishment, not father, not mother, not brother. And this the
prophets themselves declared aloud; one saying, “Brother delivers not brother. Shall man
deliver?” ( Ps. xlix. 7 , LXX.) And Ezekiel has declared somewhat more than this, saying,
“Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters.” (
<note type="footnote">309 οὗτοι κἀκεῖνοι (G. T.).</note>

Ezek. xiv. 16.) For one defense311 only, that through works,312 is there, and he who is deprived
of that cannot be saved by any other means. Revolving these things, then, and reflecting
upon them continually, let us cleanse our life and make it lustrous, that we may see the
Lord with boldness, and obtain the promised good things; through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Spirit,
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><del>1.</del> Do we then run and labor in vain? Are we sowing upon the rocks? Does the seed
fall upon the rocks? Does the seed fall without our knowing it by the wayside, and among
thorns? I am greatly troubled and fear, lest our husbandry be unprofitable; not313 as though
I shall be a loser as well as you, touching the reward of this labor. For it is not with those
who teach as it is with husbandmen. Oftentimes the husbandman after his year’s toil, his
hard work and sweat, if the earth produce no suitable return for his pains, will be314 able
to find comfort for his labors from none else, but returns ashamed and downcast from his
barn to his dwelling, his wife and children, unable to require of any man a reward for his
lengthened toil. But in our case there is315 nothing like this. For even though the soil which
we cultivate bring forth no fruit, if we have shown all industry, the Lord of it and of us will
not suffer us to depart with disappointed hopes, but will give us a recompense; for, says St.
Paul, “Every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor” ( 1 Cor. iii. 8 ),
not according to the event of things. And that it is so, hearken: “And Thou,” he saith, “Son
of man, testify unto this people, if they will hear, and if they will understand.” ( Ezek. ii. 5
, not from LXX.) And Ezekiel says,316 “If the watchman give warning what it behooves to
flee from, and what to choose, he hath delivered his own soul, although there be none that
will take heed.” ( Ezek. iii. 18, and xxxiii. 9 ; not quoted from LXX.) Yet although we have
this strong consolation, and are confident of the recompense that shall be made us, still
when we see that the work in you does not go forward, our state is not better than the state
of those husbandmen who lament and mourn, who hide their faces and are ashamed. This
is the sympathy of a teacher, this is the natural care of a father. For Moses too, when it was
in his power to have been delivered from the ingratitude of the Jews, and to have laid the
more glorious foundation of another and far greater317 people, (“Let Me alone,” said God,
“that I may consume them,318 and make of thee a nation mightier than this”— Ex. xxxii.

he did not endure even to hearken to this word, but chose rather to perish with those who
had been once allotted to him, than without them to be saved and be in greater honor. Such
ought he to be who has the charge of souls. For it is a strange thing that any one who has
weak children, will not be called the father of any others than those who are sprung from
him, but that he who has had disciples placed in his hands should be continually changing
one flock for another, that we should be catching at the charge now of these, then of those,
then again of others,320 having no real affection for any one. May we never have cause to
suspect this of you. We trust that ye abound more in faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in
love to one another and towards all men. And this we say as desiring that your zeal may be
increased, and the excellence of your conversation321 farther advanced. For it is thus that
you will be able to bring your understandings down to the very depth of the words set before
us, if no film322 of wickedness darken the eyes of your intellect, and disturb its
clearsightedness and acuteness.</p>
<p>What then is it which is set before323 us to-day? “John bare witness of Him, and cried,
saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for
He was before me.” The Evangelist is very full in making frequent mention of John, and
often bearing about his testimony. And this he does not without a reason, but very wisely;
for all the Jews held the man in great admiration, (even Josephus imputes the war to his
death;324 and shows, that, on his account, what once was the mother city, is now no city at
all,325 and continues326 the words of his encomium to great length,) and therefore desiring
by his means to make the Jews ashamed, he continually reminds them of the testimony of
the forerunner. The other Evangelists make mention of the older prophets, and at each
successive thing that took place respecting Him refer the hearer to them. Thus when the
Child is born, they say, “Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by Esias the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a
Son” ( Matt. i. 22; Isa. vii. 14 ); and when He is plotted against and sought for everywhere
so diligently, that even tender infancy is slaughtered by327 Herod, they bring in Jeremy,
saying, “In Ramah was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning,

Rachel weeping for her children” ( Matt. ii. 18; Jer. xxxi. 15 ); and again, when He comes
up out of Egypt, they mention328 Hosea, saying, “Out of Egypt have I called My Son” ( Matt.
ii. 15; Hosea xi. 1 ); and this they do everywhere. But John providing testimony more clear
and fresh, and uttering a voice more glorious than the other, brings continually forward not
those only who had departed and were dead, but one also who was alive and present, who
pointed Him out and baptized Him, him he continually introduces, not desiring to gain
credit for the master 329 through the servant, but condescending to the infirmity of his
hearers.330 For as unless He had taken the form of a servant, He would not have been easily
received, so had He not by the voice of a servant prepared the ears of his fellow-servants,
the many (at any rate) of the Jews would not331 have received the Word.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> But besides this, there was another great and wonderful provision. For because to
speak any great words concerning himself, makes a man’s witness to be suspected, and is
often an obstacle to many hearers, another comes to testify of Him. And besides this the
many332 are in a manner wont to run more readily to a voice which is more familiar and
natural to them, as recognizing it more than other voices; and therefore the voice from
heaven was uttered333 once or twice, but that of John oftentimes and continually. For
those334 of the people who had surmounted the infirmity of their nature, and had been released
from all the things of sense, could hear the Voice from heaven, and had no great need
of that of man, but in all things obeyed335 that other, and were led by it; but they who yet
moved below, and were wrapt in many veils, needed that meaner (voice). In the same way
John, because he had snipped himself in every way of the336 things of sense, needed no
other instructors,337 but was taught from heaven. “He that sent me,” saith he, “to baptize
with water, the Same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit” of God “descending,
the same is He.” ( c. i. 33 ) But the Jews who still were children, and could not as yet reach
to that height, had a man for their teacher, a man who did not speak to them words of his
own, but brought them a message from above.</p>

<p>What then saith he? He “beareth witness concerning Him, and crieth, saying” What
means that word “crieth”? Boldly, he means, and freely, without any reserve,338 he proclaims.
What does he proclaim? to what does he “bear witness,” and “cry”? “This is He of whom I
said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for He was before me.” The testimony
is dark,339 and contains besides much that is lowly. For he does not say, “This is the Son of
God, the Only-begotten, the true Son”; but what? “He that cometh after me, is preferred
before me; for He was before me.” As the mother birds do not teach their young all at once
how to fly, nor finish their teaching in a single day, but at first lead them forth so as to be
just outside the nest, then after first allowing them to rest, set them again to flying, 340 and
on the next day continue a flight much farther, and so gently, by little and little, bring them
to the proper height; just so the blessed John did not immediately bring the Jews to high
things, but taught them for a while to fly up a little above the earth saying, that Christ was
greater than he. And yet this, even this was for the time no small thing, to have been able
to persuade341 the hearers that one who had not yet appeared nor worked any wonders was
greater than a man, (John, I mean,) so marvelous, so famous, to whom all ran, and whom
they thought to be an angel. For a while therefore he labored to establish this in the minds
of his hearers, that He to whom testimony was borne was greater than he who bore it; He
that came after, than he that came before, He who had not yet appeared, than he that was
manifest and famous. And observe how prudently he introduces his testimony; for he does
not only point Him out when He has appeared, but even before He appears, proclaims Him.
For the expression, “This is He of whom I spake,” is the expression of one declaring this.
As also Matthew says, that when all came to him, he said, “I indeed baptize you with water,
but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to unloose.”342 Wherefore then even before His appearance did he this? In order that when
He appeared, the testimony might readily be received, the minds of the hearers being already
prepossessed by what was said concerning Him, and the mean external appearance not
vitiating it.343 For if without having heard anything at all concerning Him they had seen
the Lord,344 and as they beheld Him had at the same time received the testimony of John’s
words, so wonderful and great, the meanness of His appearance345 would have straightway

been an objection to the grandeur of the expressions. For Christ took on Him an appearance
so mean and ordinary, that even Samaritan women, and harlots, and publicans, had confidence
boldly to approach and converse with Him. As therefore, I said, if they had at once
heard these words and seen Himself, they might perhaps have mocked at the testimony of
John; but now because even before Christ appeared, they had often heard and had been accustomed
to 346 what was said concerning Him, they were affected in the opposite way, not
rejecting the instruction of the words by reason of the appearance of Him who was witnessed
of, but from their belief of what had been already told them, esteeming Him even more
glorious.</p>
<p>The phrase, “that cometh after,” means, “that” preacheth “after me,” not “that” was
born “after me.” And this Matthew glances at when he says,347 “after me cometh a man,”
not speaking of His birth from Mary, but of His coming to preach (the Gospel), for had he
been speaking of the birth, he would not have said, “cometh,” but “is come”; since He was
born when John spake this. What then means “is before me”? Is more glorious, more honorable.
“Do not,” he saith, “because I came preaching first from this, suppose that I am
greater than He; I am much inferior, so much inferior that I am not worthy to be counted
in the rank of a servant.” This is the sense of “is before me,” which Matthew showing in a
different manner, saith,348 “The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.” ( Luke
iii. 16.) Again, that the phrase, “is before me,” does not refer to His coming into Being, is
plain from the sequel; for had he meant to say this, what follows, “for He was before me,”
would be superfluous. For who so dull and foolish as not to know that He who “was born
before”349 him “was before”350 him? Or if the words refer to His subsistence351 before the
ages, what is said is nothing else than that “He who cometh after me came into being before
me.” Besides, such a thing as this is unintelligible, and the cause is thrown in needlessly; for
he ought to have said the contrary, if he had wished to declare this, “that He who cometh
after me was before me, since also He was born before me.” For one might with reason assign
this, (the “being born before”) as the cause of “being before,” but not the “being before,” as
the cause of “being born.” While what we assert is very reasonable. Since you all at least
know this, that they are always things uncertain not things evident, that require their causes
to be assigned. Now if the argument related to the production of substance,352 it could not

have been uncertain that he who “was born” first must needs “be” first; but because he is
speaking concerning honor, he with reason explains what seems to be a difficulty. For many
might well enquire, whence and on what pretext He who came after, became before, that
is, appeared with great honor; in reply to this question therefore, he immediately assigns
the reason; and the reason is, His Being first. He does not say, that “by some kind of advancement
he cast me who has been first behind him, and so became before me,” but that “he
was before me,” even though he arrives after me.</p>
<p>But how, says one, if the Evangelist refers353 to His manifestation to men, and to the
glory which was to attend Him from them, does he speak of what was not yet accomplished,
as having already taken place? for he does not say, “shall be,” but “was.” Because this is a
custom among the prophets of old, to speak of the future as of the past. Thus Isaiah speaking
of His slaughter does not say, “He shall be led (which would have denoted futurity) as a
sheep to the slaughter”; but “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter” ( Isa. liii. 7 ); yet He was
not yet Incarnate, but the Prophet speaks of what should be as if it had come to pass. So
David, pointing to the Crucifixion, said not, “They shall pierce My hands and My feet,” but
“They pierced My hands and My feet, and parted My garments among them, and cast lots
upon My vesture” ( Ps. xxii. 16, 18 ); and discoursing of the traitor as yet unborn, he says,
“He which did eat of My bread, hath lifted up354 his heel against Me” ( Ps. xli. 9 ); and of
the circumstances of the Crucifixion, “They gave Me gall for meat, and in My thirst they
gave Me vinegar to drink.” ( Ps. lxix. 21.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Do you desire that we adduce more examples, or do these suffice? For my part, I
think they do; for if we have not dug over the ground in all its extent,355 we have at least
dug down to its bottom; and this last kind of work is not less laborious than the former; and
we fear lest by straining your attention immoderately we cause you to fall back.</p>
<p>Let us then give to our discourse a becoming conclusion. And what conclusion is becoming?
A suitable giving of glory to God; and that is suitable which is given, not by words only,
but much more by actions. For He saith, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may
see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.” ( Matt. v. 16.) Now
nothing is more full of light than a most excellent conversation. As one of the wise men has
said, “The paths of the just shine like the light” ( Prov. iv. 18 , LXX.); and they shine not for
them alone who kindle the flame by their works, and are guides in the way of righteousness,
but also for those who are their neighbors. Let us then pour oil into these lamps, that the
flame become higher,356 that rich light appear. For not only has this oil great strength now,

but even when sacrifices were at their height,357 it was far more acceptable than they could
be. “I will have mercy,”358 He saith, “and not sacrifice.” ( Matt. xii. 7; Hos. vi. 6.) And with
good reason; for that is a lifeless altar, this a living; and all that is laid on that altar becomes
the food of fire, and ends in dust, and it is poured forth as ashes, and the smoke of it is dissolved
into the substance of the air; but here there is nothing like this, the fruits which it
bears are different. As the words of Paul declare; for in describing the treasures of kindness
to the poor laid up by the Corinthians, he writes, “For the administration of this service not
only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God.”
( 2 Cor. ix. 12.) And again; “Whiles they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the
Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; and by their
prayer for you, which long after you.” Dost thou behold it 359 resolving itself into thanksgiving
and praise of God, and continual prayers of those who have been benefited, and more fervent
charity? Let us then sacrifice, beloved, let us sacrifice every day upon these altars. For this
sacrifice is greater than prayer and fasting, and many things beside, if only it come from
honest gain, and honest toils, and be pure from all covetousness, and rapine, and violence.
For God accepts such 360 offerings as these, but the others He turns away from and hates;
He will not be honored out of other men’s calamities, such sacrifice is unclean and profane,
and would rather anger God than appease Him. So that we must use all carefulness, that we
do not, in the place of service, insult Him whom we would honor. For if Cain for making a
second-rate offering,361 having done no other wrong, suffered extreme punishment, how
shall not we when we offer anything gained by rapine and covetousness, suffer yet more
severely. It is for this that God has shown to us the pattern362 of this commandment, that
we might have mercy, not be severe to our fellow-servants; but he who takes what belongs
to one and gives it to another, hath not shown mercy, but inflicted hurt, and done an extreme
injustice. As then a stone cannot yield oil, so neither can cruelty produce humanity; for alms
when it has such a root as this is alms363 no longer. Therefore I exhort that we look not to
this only, that we give to those that need, but also that we give not from other men’s plunder.
“When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear?” ( Ecclus. xxxiv.
24.) If we guide ourselves thus strictly, we shall be able by the grace of God to obtain much

<p>John i. 16</p>
<p>“And of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> I said the other day, that John, to resolve the doubts of those who should question
with themselves how the Lord, though He came after to the preaching, became before and
more glorious than he, added, “for He was before me.” And this is indeed one reason. But
not content with this, he adds again a second, which now he declares. What is it? “And of
his fullness,” says he, “have all we received, and grace for grace.” With these again he mentions
another. What is this? That</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>And what means that, saith he, “Of His fullness have all we received”? for to this we
must for a while direct our discourse. He possesseth not, says he, the gift by participation,365
but is Himself the very Fountain and very Root of all good, very Life, and very Light, and
very Truth, not retaining within Himself the riches of His good things, but overflowing with
them unto all others, and after the overflowing remaining full, in nothing diminished by
supplying others, but streaming ever forth, and imparting to others a share of these blessings,
He remains in sameness of perfection. What I possess is by participation, (for I received it
from another) and is a small portion of the whole, as it were a poor366 rain-drop compared
with the untold abyss or the boundless sea; or rather not even can this instance fully express
what we attempt to say, for if you take a drop from the sea, you have lessened the sea itself,367
though the diminution be imperceptible. But of that Fountain we cannot say this; how much
soever a man draw, It continues undiminished. We therefore must needs proceed to another
instance, a weak one also, and not able to establish what we seek, but which guides us better
than the former one to the thought now proposed to us.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that there is a fountain of fire; that from that fountain ten thousand
lamps are kindled, twice as many, thrice as many, ofttimes as many; does not the fire remain
at the same degree of fullness even after its imparting of its virtue to such members? It is
plain to every man that it does. Now if in the case of bodies which are made up of parts, and
are diminished by abstraction, one has been found of such a nature, that after supplying to

<note type="footnote">367 or, “just so much.”</note>

<pb n="101"/>
others something from itself it sustains no loss, much more will this take place with that
incorporeal and uncompounded Power. If in the instance given, that which is communicated
is substance and body, is divided yet does not suffer division, when our discourse is concerning
an energy, and an energy too of an incorporeal substance, it is much more probable that
this will undergo nothing of the sort. And therefore John said, “Of His fullness have all we
received,” and joins his own testimony to that of the Baptist; for the expression, “Of his
fulness have we all received,” belongs not to the forerunner but to the disciple; and its
meaning is something like this: “Think not,” he says, “that we, who long time companied
with Him, and partook of His food368 and table, bear witness through favor,” since even
John, who did not even know Him before, who had never even been with Him, but merely
saw Him in company with others when he was baptizing cried out, “He was before me,”
having from that source369 received all; and all we the twelve, the three hundred, the three
thousand, the five thousand, the many myriads of Jews, all the fullness of the faithful who
then were, and now are, and hereafter shall be, have “received of His fulness.” What have
we received? “grace for grace,” saith he. What grace, for what? For the old, the new. For
there was a righteousness, and again a righteousness, (“Touching the righteousness which
is in the law,” saith Paul “blameless.”) ( Philip. iii. 6.) There was a faith, there is a faith.
(“From faith to faith.”) ( Rom. i. 17.) There was an adoption, there is an adoption. (“To
whom pertaineth the adoption.”) ( Rom. ix. 4.) There was a glory, there is a glory. (“For if
that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.”) (
2 Cor. iii. 11.) There was a law, and there is a law. (“For the law of the Spirit of life hath
made me free.”) ( Rom. viii. 2.) There was a service, and there is a service. (“To whom pertaineth
the service”— Rom. ix. 4: and again: “Serving God in the Spirit.”) ( Philip. iii. 3.)
There was a covenant, and there is a covenant. (“I will make with you370 a new covenant,
not according to the covenant which I made with your371 fathers.”) ( Jer. xxxi. 31.) There
was a sanctification, and there is a sanctification: there was a baptism, and there is a Baptism:
there was a sacrifice, and there is a Sacrifice: there was a temple, and there is a temple: there
was a circumcision, and there is a circumcision; and so too there was a “grace,” and there
is a “grace.” But the words in the first case are used as types, in the second as realities, preserving
a sameness of sound, though not of sense. So in patterns and figures, the shape of
a man scratched with white lines372 upon a black ground is called a man as well as that
which has received the correct coloring; and in the case of statues, the figure whether formed

of gold or of plaster, is alike called a statue, though in the one case as a model, in the other
as a reality.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Do not then, because the same words are used, suppose that the things are identical,
nor yet diverse either; for in that they were models they did not differ from the truth; but
in that they merely preserved the outline, they were less than the truth. What is the difference
in all these instances? Will you that we take in hand and proceed to examine one or two of
the cases mentioned? thus the rest will be plain to you; and we shall see that the first were
lessons for children, the last for high-minded full-grown men; that the first laws were made
as for mortals, the latter as for angels.</p>
<p>Whence then shall we begin? From the sonship itself? What then is the distinction
between the first and second? The first is the honor of a name, in the second the thing goes
with it. Of the first the Prophet says, “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of
the Most High” ( Ps. lxxxii. 6 ); but of the latter, that they “were born of God.” How, and in
what way? By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. For they, even
after they had received the title of sons, retained the spirit of slavery, (for while they remained
slaves they were honored with this appellation,) but we being made free, received the honor,
not in name, but in deed. And this Paul has declared and said, “For ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father.” ( Rom. viii. 15.) For having been born again,373 and, as one may say, thoroughly
remade,374 we so are called “sons.” And if one consider the character of the holiness,
what the first was and what the second, he will find there also great375 difference. They when
they did not worship idols, nor commit fornication or adultery, were called by this name;
but we become holy, not by refraining from these vices merely, but by acquiring things
greater. And this gift we obtain first by means of the coming upon us of the Holy Ghost;
and next, by a rule of life far more comprehensive376 than that of the Jews. To prove that
these words are not mere boasting hear what He saith to them, “Ye shall not use divination,377
nor make purification of your children, for ye are a holy people.”378 So that holiness with
them consisted in being free from the customs of idolatry; but it is not so with us. “That
she may be holy,” saith Paul, “in body and spirit.” ( 1 Cor. vii. 34.) “Follow peace, and holiness,
without which no man shall see the Lord” ( Heb. xii. 14 ): and, “Perfecting holiness in
the fear of God.” ( 2 Cor. vii. 1.) For the word “holy” has not force to give the same meaning
<note type="footnote">373 or, “from above.”</note>

<pb n="103"/>
in every case to which it is applied; since God is called “Holy,” though not as we are. What,
for instance, does the Prophet say, when he heard that cry raised379 by the flying Seraphim?
“Woe is me! because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
lips” ( Isa. vi. 5 ); though he was holy and clean; but if we be compared with the holiness
which is above, we are unclean. Angels are holy, Archangels are holy, the Cherubim and
Seraphim themselves are holy, but of this holiness again there is a double difference; that
is, in relation to us, and to the higher powers.380 We might proceed to all the other points,
but then the discussion would become too long, and its extent too great. We will therefore
desist from proceeding farther, and leave it to you to take in hand the rest, for it is in your
power at home to put these things together, and examine their difference, and in the same
way to go over what remains. “Give,” saith one, “a starting place to the wise, and he becometh
wiser.” ( Prov. ix. 9 , LXX.) The beginning is from us, but the end will be from you. We must
now resume the connection.</p>
<p>After having said, “Of His fullness have all we received,” he adds, “and grace for grace.”
For by grace the Jews were saved: “I chose you,” saith God, “not because you were many in
number, but because of your fathers.” ( Deut. vii. 7 , LXX.) If now they were chosen by God
not for their own good deeds,381 it is manifest that by grace they obtained this honor. And
we too all are saved by grace, but not in like manner; not for the same objects, but for objects
much greater and higher. The grace then that is with us is not like theirs. For not only was
pardon of sins given to us, (since this we have in common with them, for all have sinned,)
but righteousness also, and sanctification, and sonship, and the gift of the Spirit far more
glorious382 and more abundant. By this grace we have become the beloved of God, no longer
as servants, but as sons and friends. Wherefore he saith, “grace for grace.” Since even the
things of the law were of grace, and the very fact of man383 being created from nothing, (for
we did not receive this as a recompense for past good deeds, how could we, when we even
were not? but from God who is ever the first to bestow His benefits,) and not only that we
were created from nothing, but that when created, we straightway learned what we must
and what we must not do, and that we received this law in our very nature, and that our
Creator entrusted to us the impartial rule of conscience, these I say, are proofs of the greatest
grace and unspeakable lovingkindness. And the recovery of this law after it had become
corrupt, by means of the written (Law), this too was the work of grace. For what might have

<note type="footnote">380 Morel. and ms. in Bodleian read the passage thus: “are holy, but the (Holiness) of God is greater than

been expected to follow was, that they who falsified384 the law once given should suffer
correction and punishments; but what actually took place was not this, but, on the contrary,
an amending of our nature, and pardon, not of debt, but given through mercy and grace.
For to show that it was of grace and mercy, hear what David saith; “The Lord executeth
righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed; He made known His ways unto
Moses, His acts unto the children of Israel” ( Ps. ciii. 6, 7 ): and again; “Good and upright
is the Lord, therefore will He give laws to them that are in the way.” ( Ps. xxv. 8.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Therefore that men received the law was of pity, mercies, and grace; and for this
reason he saith, “Grace for grace.” But striving yet more fervently385 to (express) the greatness
of the gifts, he goes on to say,</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>See ye how gently, by a single word and by little and little, both John the Baptist and
John the Disciple lead up their hearers to the highest knowledge, having first exercised them
in humbler things? The former having compared to himself Him who is incomparably superior
to all, thus afterwards shows His superiority, by saying, “is become before me,” and
then adding the words, “was before me”: while the latter has done much more than he,
though too little for the worthiness of the Only-Begotten, for he makes the comparison, not
with John, but with one reverenced by the Jews more than John, with Moses. “For the law,”
saith he, “was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Observe his wisdom. He makes enquiry not concerning the person, but the things; for
these being proved, it was probable that even the senseless would of necessity receive from
them a much higher judgment and notion respecting Christ. For when facts bear witness,
which cannot be suspected386 of doing so either from favor to any, or from malice, they afford
a means of judging which cannot be doubted even by the senseless; for they remain to open
view just as their actors may have arranged them, and therefore their evidence is the least
liable to suspicion of any. And see how he makes the comparison easy even to the weaker
sort; for he does not prove the superiority by argument, but points out the difference by the
bare words, opposing “grace and truth” to “law,” and “came” to “was given.” Between each
of these there is a great difference; for one, “was given,” belongs to something ministered,
when one has received from another, and given to whom he was commanded to give; but
the other, “grace and truth came,” befits a king forgiving all offenses, with authority, and
himself furnishing the gift. Wherefore He said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” ( Matt. ix. 2 );
and again, “But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins

<pb n="105"/>
(He saith to the sick of the palsy), Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.” ( Ibid.
v. 6.)</p>
<p>Seest387 thou how “grace” cometh by Him? look also to “truth.” His “grace” the instance
just mentioned, and what happened in the case of the thief, and the gift of Baptism, and the
grace of the Spirit given by Him388 declare, and many other things. But His “truth” we shall
more clearly know, if we understand the types. For the types like patterns anticipated and
sketched beforehand the dispensations389 which should be accomplished under the new
covenant, and Christ came and fulfilled them. Let us now consider the types in few words,
for we cannot at the present time go through all that relates to them; but when you have
learned some points from those (instances) which I shall set before you,390 you will know
the others also.</p>
<p>Will you then that we begin with the Passion itself? What then saith the type? “Take ye
a lamb for an house, and kill it, and do as he commanded and ordained.” ( Ex. xii. 3.) But
it is not so with Christ. He doth not command this to be done, but Himself becomes It,391
by offering Himself a Sacrifice and Oblation to His Father.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> See how the type was “given by Moses,” but the “Truth came by Jesus Christ.” ( Ex.
xvii. 12.)</p>
<p>Again, when the Amalekites warred in Mount Sinai, the hands of Moses were supported,
being stayed up by Aaron and Hur standing on either side of him ( Ex. xvii. 12 ); but when
Christ came, He of Himself stretched forth His Hands upon the Cross. Hast thou observed
how the type “was given,” but “the Truth came”?</p>
<p>Again, the Law said, “Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are
written in this book.” ( Deut. xxvii. 26 , LXX.) But what saith grace? “Come unto Me, all ye
that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” ( Matt. xi. 28 ); and Paul, “Christ
hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.” ( Gal. iii. 13.)</p>
<p>Since then we have enjoyed such “grace” and “truth,” I exhort you that we be not more
slothful by reason of the greatness of the gift; for the greater the honor of which we have
been deemed worthy, the greater our debt of excellence; for one who has received but small
benefits, even though he makes but small returns, does not deserve the same condemnation;
but he who has been raised to the highest summit of honor, and yet manifests groveling and
mean dispositions, will be worthy of much greater punishment. May I never have to suspect
this of you. For we trust in the Lord that you have winged your souls for heaven, that you

have removed from earth, that being in the world ye handle not the things of the world; yet
though so persuaded, we do not cease thus continually to exhort you. In the games of the
heathen, they whom all the spectators encourage are not those who have fallen and lie supine,
but those who are exerting themselves and running still; of the others, (since they would be
doing what would be of no use,392 and would not be able to raise up by their encouragements
men once for all severed from victory,) they cease to take any notice. But in this case some
good may be expected, not only of you who are sober, but even of those who have fallen, if
they would but be converted. Wherefore we use every means, exhorting, reproving, encouraging,
praising, in order that we may bring about your salvation. Be not then offended by
our continual admonishing concerning the Christian conversation, for the words are not
the words of one accusing you of sloth, but of one who has very excellent hopes respecting
you. And not to you alone, but to ourselves who speak them, are these words said, yea, and
shall be said, for we too need the same teaching; so though they be spoken by us, yet nothing
hinders their being spoken to us, (for the Word, when it finds a man in fault, amends him,
when clear and free, sets him as far off from it as possible,) and we ourselves are not pure
from transgressions. The course of healing is the same for all, the medicines are set forth
for all, only the application is not the same, but is made according to the choice of those
who use the medicines; for one who will handle the remedy as he ought, gains some benefit
from the application, while he who does not place it upon the wound, makes the evil
greater, and brings it to the most painful end. Let us then not fret when we are being healed,
but much rather rejoice, even though the system of discipline bring bitter pains, for hereafter
it will show to us fruit sweeter than any. Let us then do all to this end, that we may depart
to that world,393 cleared of the wounds and strokes which the teeth of sin make in the soul,
so that having become worthy to behold the countenance of Christ, we may be delivered in
that day, not to the avenging and cruel powers, but to those who are able to bring us to that
inheritance of the heavens which is prepared for them that love Him; to which may it come
to pass that we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 18</p>
<p>“No man hath seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
Father, He hath declared Him.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> God will not have us listen to the words and sentences contained in the Scriptures
carelessly, but with much attention. This is why the blessed David hath prefixed in many
places to his Psalms the title “for understanding,”394 and hath said, “Open Thou mine eyes,
that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy Law.” ( Ps. xxxii. 42, U+0026c.; Ps. cxix. 18.) And
after him his son again shows that we ought to “seek out wisdom as silver,395 and to make
merchandise of her rather than of gold.” ( Prov. ii. 4 and iii. 14 [partially quoted]; John v.
39.) And the Lord when He exhorts the Jews to “search the Scriptures,” the more urges us
to the enquiry, for He would not thus have spoken if it were possible to comprehend them
immediately at the first reading. No one would ever search for what is obvious and at hand,
but for that which is wrapt in shadow, and which must be found after much enquiry; and
so to arouse us to the search He calls them “hidden treasure.” ( Prov. ii. 4; Matt. xiii. 44.)
These words are said to us that we may not apply ourselves to the words of the Scriptures
carelessly or in a chance way, but with great exactness. For if any one listen to what is said
in them without enquiring into the meaning, and receive all so as it is spoken, according to
the letter, he will suppose many unseemly things of God, will admit of Him that He is a
man, that He is made of brass, is wrathful, is furious, and many opinions yet worse than
these. But if he fully learn the sense that lies beneath, he will be freed from all this unseemliness.
( Rev. i. 15.) The very text which now lies before us says, that God has a bosom, a
thing proper to bodily substances, yet no one is so insane as to imagine, that He who is
without body is a body. In order then that we may properly interpret the entire passage according
to its spiritual meaning, let us search it through from its beginning.</p>
<p>“No man hath seen God at any time.” By what connection of thought does the Apostle
come to say this? After showing the exceeding greatness of the gifts of Christ, and the infinite
difference between them and those ministered by Moses, he would add the reasonable cause
of the difference. Moses, as being a servant, was minister of lower things, but Christ being
Lord and King, and the King’s Son, brought to us things far greater, being ever with the
Father, and beholding Him continually; wherefore He saith, “No man hath seen God at any
time.” What then shall we answer to the most mighty of voice, Esaias, when he says, “I saw

the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up” ( Isa. vi. 1 ); and to John himself testifying
of Him, that “he said these things when he had seen His glory”? ( c. xii. 41.) What also to
Ezekiel? for he too beheld Him sitting above the Cherubim. ( Ezek. i. and x.) What to Daniel?
for he too saith, “The Ancient of days did sit” ( Dan. vii. 9.) What to Moses himself, saying,
“Show me Thy Glory, that I may see Thee so as to know Thee.” ( Ex. xxxiii. 13 , partly from
LXX.) And Jacob took his name from this very thing, being called396 “Israel”; for Israel is
“one that sees God.”397 And others have seen him. How then saith John, “No man hath seen
God at any time”? It is to declare, that all these were instances of (His) condescension, not
the vision of the Essence itself unveiled. For had they seen the very Nature, they would not
have beheld It under different forms, since that is simple, without form, or parts, or
bounding lines. It sits not, nor stands, nor walks: these things belong all to bodies. But how
He Is, He only knoweth. And this He hath declared by a certain prophet, saying, “I have
multiplied visions, and used similitudes398 by the hands of the prophets” ( Hos. xii. 10 ),
that is, “I have condescended, I have not appeared as I really was.” For since His Son was
about to appear in very flesh, He prepared them from old time to behold the substance of
God, as far as it was possible for them to see It; but what God really is, not only have not
the prophets seen, but not even angels nor archangels. If you ask them, you shall not hear
them answering anything concerning His Essence, but sending up,399 “Glory to God in the
Highest, on earth peace, good will towards men.” ( Luke ii. 14.) If you desire to learn
something from Cherubim or Seraphim, you shall hear the mystic song of His Holiness,
and that “heaven and earth are full of His glory.” ( Isa. vi. 3.) If you enquire of the higher
powers, you shall but find400 that their one work is the praise of God. “Praise ye Him,” saith
David, “all His hosts.” ( Ps. cxlviii. 2.) But the Son only Beholds Him, and the Holy Ghost.
How can any created nature even see the Uncreated? If we are absolutely unable clearly to
discern any incorporeal power whatsoever, even though created, as has been often proved
in the case of angels, much less can we discern the Essence which is incorporeal and uncreated.
Wherefore Paul saith, “Whom no man hath seen, nor can see.” ( 1 Tim. vi. 16.) Does
then this special attribute401 belong to the Father only, not to the Son? Away with the
thought. It belongs also to the Son; and to show that it does so, hear Paul declaring this
point, and saying, that He “is the Image of the invisible God.” ( Col. i. 15.) Now if He be the
Image of the Invisible, He must be invisible Himself, for otherwise He would not be an

“image.” And wonder not that Paul saith in another place, “God was manifested in the Flesh”
( 1 Tim. iii. 16 ); because the manifestation402 took place by means of the flesh, not according
to (His) Essence. Besides, Paul shows that He is invisible, not only to men, but also to the
powers above, for after saying, “was manifested in the Flesh,” he adds, “was seen of angels.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> So that even to angels He then became visible, when He put on the Flesh; but before
that time they did not so behold Him, because even to them His Essence was invisible.</p>
<p>“How then,” asks some one, “did Christ say, ‘Despise not one of these little ones, for I
tell you, that their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven’? ( Matt.
xviii. 10.) Hath then God a face, and is He bounded by the heavens?” Who so mad as to assert
this? What then is the meaning of the words? As when He saith, “Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God” ( Matt. v. 8 ), He means that intellectual vision which is possible
to us, and the having God in the thoughts; so in the case of angels, we must understand403
that by reason of their pure and sleepless404 nature they do nothing else, but always image
to themselves God. And therefore Christ saith, that “No man knoweth the Father, save the
Son.” ( Matt. x. 27.) What then, are we all in ignorance? God forbid; but none knoweth Him
as the Son knoweth Him. As then many405 have seen Him in the mode of vision permitted
to them, but no one has beheld His Essence, so many of us know God, but what His substance
can be none knoweth, save only He that was begotten of Him. For by “knowledge” He here
means an exact idea and comprehension, such as the Father hath of the Son. “As the Father
knoweth Me, even so know I the Father.” ( c. x. 15.)</p>
<p>Observe, therefore, with what fullness406 the Evangelist speaks; for having said that “no
man hath seen God at any time,” he does not go on to say, “that the Son who hath seen,
hath declared Him,” but adds something beyond “seeing” by the words, “Who is in the
bosom of the Father”; because, “to dwell407 in the bosom” is far more than “to see.” For he
that merely “seeth” hath not an in every way exact knowledge of the object, but he that
“dwelleth in the bosom” can be ignorant of nothing. Now lest when thou hearest that “none
knoweth the Father, save the Son,” thou shouldest assert that although He knoweth the
Father more than all, yet He knoweth not how great He is, the Evangelist says that He dwells
in the bosom of the Father; and Christ Himself declares, that He knoweth Him as much as
the Father knoweth the Son. Ask therefore the gainsayer, “Tell me, doth the Father know
the Son?” And if he be not mad, he will certainly answer “Yes.” Then ask again; “Doth He

<pb n="110"/>
see and know Him with exact vision and knowledge? Doth He know clearly what He Is?”
He will certainly confess this also. From this next collect the exact comprehension the Son
has of the Father. For He saith, “As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father” ( c.
x. 15 ); and in another place, “Not that any man hath seen the Father, save He which is of
God.” ( c. vi. 46.) Wherefore, as I said, the Evangelist mentions “the bosom,” to show all
this to us by that one word; that great is the affinity and nearness of the Essence, that the
knowledge is nowise different, that the power is equal. For the Father would not have in
His bosom one of another essence, nor would He have dared, had He been one amongst
many servants, to live408 in the bosom of his Lord, for this belongs only to a true Son, to
one who has409 much confidence towards His Father, and who is in nothing inferior to
Him.</p>
<p>Wouldest thou learn also His eternity? Hear what Moses saith concerning the Father.
When he asked what he was commanded to answer should the Jews enquire of him, “Who
it was that had sent him,” he heard these words: “Say, I AM hath sent me.” ( Ex. iii. 14.) Now
the expression “I AM,”410 is significative of Being ever, and Being without beginning, of
Being really and absolutely. And this also the expression, “Was in the beginning,” declares,
being indicative of Being ever; so that John uses this word to show that the Son Is from
everlasting to everlasting411 in the bosom of the Father. For that you may not from the
sameness of name, suppose that He is some one of those who are made sons by grace, first,
the article is added, distinguishing Him from those by grace. But if this does not content
you, if you still look earthwards, hear a name more absolute than this, “Only-Begotten.” If
even after this you still look below, “I will not refuse,” says he, (St. John,) “to apply to God
a term belonging to man, I mean the word ‘bosom,’ only suspect nothing degrading.” Dost
thou see the lovingkindness and carefulness of the Lord? God applies412 to Himself unworthy
expressions, that even so thou mayest see through them, and have some great and lofty
thought of Him; and dost thou tarry below? For tell me, wherefore is that gross and carnal
word “bosom” employed in this place? Is it that we may suppose God to be a body? Away,
he by no means saith so. Why then is it spoken? for if by it neither the genuineness of the
Son is established, nor that God is not a body, the word, because it serves no purpose, is
superfluously thrown in. Why then is it spoken? For I shall not desist from asking thee this

question. Is it not very plain, that it is for no other reason but that by it we might understand
the genuineness of the Only-Begotten, and His Co-eternity with the Father?</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “He hath declared Him,” saith John. What hath he declared? That “no man hath
seen God at any time”? That “God is one”? But this all the other prophets testify, and Moses
continually413 exclaims, “The Lord thy God is one Lord” ( Deut. vi. 4 ); and Esaias, “Before
Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.” ( Isa. xliii. 10.) What more
then have we learned from “the Son which is in the bosom of the Father”? What from “the
Only-Begotten”? In the first place, these very words were uttered by His working; in the
next place, we have received a teaching that is far clearer, and learned that “God is a spirit,
and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth” ( c. iv. 24 ); and again,
that it is impossible to see God; “that no man knoweth” Him, “save the Son” ( Matt. xi. 27
); that He is the Father of the true and Only-Begotten; and all other things that are told us
of Him. But the word “hath declared”414 shows the plainer and clearer teaching which He
gave not to the Jews only but to all the world, and established. To the prophets not even all
the Jews gave heed, but to the Only-Begotten Son of God all the world yielded and obeyed.
So the “declaration” in this place shows the greater clearness of His teaching, and therefore
also He is called “Word,” and “Angel415 of great Counsel.”416</p>
<p>Since then we have been vouchsafed a larger and more perfect teaching, God having no
longer spoken by the prophets, but “having in these last days spoken to us by His Son” (
Heb. i. 1 ), let us show forth a conversation far higher than theirs, and suitable to the honor
bestowed on us. Strange would it be that He should have so far lowered Himself, as to choose
to speak to us no longer by His servants, but by His own mouth, and yet we should show
forth nothing more than those of old. They had Moses for their teacher, we, Moses’ Lord.
Let us then exhibit a heavenly wisdom417 worthy of this honor, and let us have nothing to
do with earth. It was for this that He brought His teaching from heaven above, that He might
remove our thoughts thither, that we might be imitators of our Teacher according to our
power. But how may we become imitators of Christ? By acting in everything for the common
good, and not merely seeking our own. “For even Christ,” saith Paul, “pleased not Himself,
but as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.” ( Rom. xv. 3;
Ps. lxix. 9.) Let no one therefore seek his own. In truth, a man (really) seeks his own good
when he looks to that of his neighbor. What is their good is ours; we are one body, and parts
and limbs one of another. Let us not then be as though we were rent asunder. Let no one

say, “such a person is no friend of mine, nor relation, nor neighbor, I have nought to do
with him, how shall I approach, how address him?” Though he be neither relation nor friend,
yet he is a man, who shares the same nature with thee, owns the same Lord, is thy fellowservant,
and fellow-sojourner,418 for he is born in the same world. And if besides he partakes
of the same faith, behold he hath also become a member of thee: for what friendship could
work such union, as the relationship of faith? And our intimacy one with another must not
be such nearness only as friends ought to show to friends, but such as is between limb and
limb, because no man can possibly discover any intimacy greater than this sort of friendship
and fellowship.419 As then you cannot say, “Whence arises my intimacy and connection
with this limb?” (that would be ridiculous;) so neither can you say so in the case of your
brother. “We are all baptized into one body” ( 1 Cor. xii. 13 ), saith Paul. “Wherefore into
one body?” That we be not rent asunder, but preserve the just proportions of that one body
by our intercourse and friendship one with another.</p>
<p>Let us not then despise one another, lest we be neglectful of ourselves.420 “For no man
ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it.” ( Eph. v. 29.) And therefore
God hath given to us but one habitation, this earth, hath distributed all things equally, hath
lighted one sun for us all, hath spread above us one roof, the sky, made one table, the earth,
bear421 food for us. And another table hath He given far better than this, yet that too is one,
(those who share our mysteries understand my words,) one manner of birth He hath bestowed
on all, the spiritual, we all have one country, that in the heavens, of the same cup
drink we all. He hath not bestowed on the rich man a gift more abundant and more honorable,
and on the poor one more mean and small, but He hath called all alike. He hath given
carnal things with equal regard to all,422 and spiritual in like manner. Whence then proceeds
the great inequality of conditions in life? From the avarice and pride of the wealthy. But let
not, brethren, let not this any longer be; and when matters of universal interest and more
pressing necessity bring us together, let us not be divided by things earthly and insignificant:
I mean, by wealth and poverty, by bodily relationship, by enmity and friendship; for all these
things are a shadow, nay less substantial than a shadow, to those who possess the bond of
charity from above. Let us then preserve this unbroken, and none of those evil spirits423

<p>John i. 19</p>
<p>“And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, Who art thou?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A dreadful thing is envy, beloved, a dreadful thing and a pernicious, to the enviers,
not to the envied. For it harms and wastes them first, like some mortal venom deeply seated
in their souls; and if by chance it injure its objects, the harm it does is small and trifling, and
such as brings greater gain than loss. Indeed not in the case of envy only, but in every other,
it is not he that has suffered, but he that has done the wrong, who receives injury. For had
not this been so, Paul would not have enjoined the disciples rather to endure wrong than
to inflict it, when he says, “Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer
yourselves to be defrauded?” ( 1 Cor. vi. 7.) Well he knew, that destruction ever follows, not
the injured party, but the injuring. All this I have said, by reason of the envy of the Jews.
Because those who had flocked from the cities to John, and had condemned their own sins,
and caused themselves to be baptized, repenting as it were after Baptism, send to ask him,
“Who art thou?” Of a truth they were the offspring of vipers, serpents, and even worse if
possible than this. O evil and adulterous and perverse generation, after having been baptized,
do ye then become vainly curious, and question about the Baptist? What folly can be greater
than this of yours? How was it that ye came forth? that ye confessed your sins, that ye ran
to the Baptist? How was it that you asked him what you must do? when in all this you were
acting unreasonably, since you knew not the principle and purpose of his coming. Yet of
this the blessed John said nothing, nor does he charge or reproach them with it, but answers
them with all gentleness.</p>
<p>It is worth while to learn why he did thus. It was, that their wickedness might be manifest
and plain to all men. Often did John testify of Christ to the Jews, and when he baptized them
he continually made mention of Him to his company, and said, “I indeed baptize you with
water, but there cometh One after me who is mightier than I; He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost and with fire.” ( Matt. iii. 11.) With regard to him they were affected by a human
feeling; for, tremblingly attentive425 to the opinion of the world, and looking to “the outward
appearance” ( 2 Cor. x. 7 ), they deemed it an unworthy thing that he should be subject to
Christ. Since there were many things that pointed out John for an illustrious person. In the
first place, his distinguished and noble descent; for he was the son of a chief priest. Then
his conversation, his austere mode of life, his contempt of all human things; for despising
dress and table, and house and food itself, he had passed his former time in the desert. In
<note type="footnote">425 ἐ πτοημένοι.</note>

<pb n="115"/>
the case of Christ all was the contrary of this. His family was mean, (as they often objected
to Him, saying, “Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his
brethren James and Joses?”) ( Matt. xiii. 55 ); and that which was supposed to be His country
was held in such evil repute, that even Nathanael said, “Can there any good thing come out
of Nazareth?” ( c. i. 46.) His mode of living was ordinary, and His garments not better than
those of the many. For He was not girt with a leathern girdle, nor was His raiment of hair,
nor did He eat honey and locusts. But He fared like all others, and was present at the feasts
of wicked men and publicans, that He might draw them to Him. Which thing the Jews not
understanding reproached Him with, as He also saith Himself, “The Son of Man came eating
and drinking, and they say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners.” ( Matt. xi. 19.) When then John continually sent them from himself to Jesus,
who seemed to them a meaner person, being ashamed and vexed at this, and wishing rather
to have him for their teacher, they did not dare to say so plainly, but send to him, thinking
by their flattery to induce him to confess that he was the Christ. They do not therefore send
to him mean men, as in the case of Christ, for when they wished to lay hold on Him, they
sent servants, and then Herodians, and the like, but in this instance, “priests and Levites,”
and not merely “priests,” but those “from Jerusalem,” that is, the more honorable; for the
Evangelist did not notice this without a cause. And they send to ask, “Who art thou?” Yet
the manner of his birth was well known to all, so that all said, “What manner of child shall
this be?” ( Luke i. 66 ); and the report had gone forth into all the hill country. And afterwards
when he came to Jordan, all the cities were set on the wing, and came to him from Jerusalem,
and from all Judæa, to be baptized. Why then do they426 now ask? Not because they did not
know him, (how could that be, when he had been made manifest in so many ways?) but
because they wished to bring him to do that which I have mentioned.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Hear then how this blessed person answered to the intention with which they asked
the question, not to the question itself. When they said, “Who art thou?” he did not at once
give them what would have been the direct answer, “I am the voice of one crying in the
wilderness.” But what did he? He removed the suspicion they had formed; for, saith the
Evangelist, being asked, “Who art thou?”</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “He confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.”</p>
<p>Observe the wisdom of the Evangelist. He mentions this for the third time, to set forth
the excellency of the Baptist, and their wickedness and folly. And Luke also says, that when
the multitudes supposed him to be the Christ, he again removes their suspicion.427 This is
<note type="footnote">426 al. “these therefore.”</note>
<note type="footnote">427 Morel, “in like manner one may see in Luke, (iii. 16 ,) John saying to those who reasoned concerning
him whether he was the Christ, that “One mightier than I cometh,” and by his answer again removing such a
suspicion.”</note>

<pb n="116"/>
the part of an honest servant, not only not to take to himself his master’s honor, but also to
reject it428 when given to him by the many. But the multitudes arrived at this supposition
from simplicity and ignorance; these questioned him from an ill intention, which I have
mentioned, expecting, as I said, to draw him over to their purpose by their flattery. Had
they not expected this, they would not have proceeded immediately to another question,
but would have been angry with him for having given them an answer foreign to their enquiry,
and would have said, “Why, did we suppose that? did we come to ask thee that?” But
now as taken and detected in the fact, they proceed to another question, and say,</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “What then? art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.”</p>
<p>For they expected that Elias also would come, as Christ declares; for when His disciples
enquired, “How then do the scribes say that Elias must first come?” ( Matt. xvii. 10 ) He
replied, “Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.” Then they ask, “Art thou that
prophet? and he answered, No.” ( Matt. xvii. 10.) Yet surely he was a prophet. Wherefore
then doth he deny it? Because again he looks to the intention of his questioners. For they
expected that some especial prophet should come, because Moses said, “The Lord thy God
will raise up unto thee a Prophet of thy brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye harken.”
( Deut. xviii. 15.) Now this was Christ. Wherefore they do not say, “Art thou a prophet?”
meaning thereby one of the ordinary prophets; but the expression, “Art thou the prophet?”
with the addition of the article, means, “Art thou that Prophet who was foretold by Moses?”
and therefore he denied not that he was a prophet, but that he was “that Prophet.”</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them
that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?”</p>
<p>Observe them pressing him more vehemently, urging him, repeating their questions,
and not desisting; while he first kindly removes false opinions concerning himself, and then
sets before them one which is true. For, saith he,</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.”</p>
<p>When he had spoken some high and lofty words concerning Christ, as if (replying) to
their opinion, he immediately betook himself to the Prophet to draw from thence confirmation
of his assertion.</p>
<p>Ver. 24, 25. “And [saith the Evangelist] they who were sent were of the Pharisees. And
they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ,
neither Elias, neither that Prophet?”</p>
<p>Seest thou not without reason I said that they wished to bring him to this? and the
reason why they did not at first say so was, lest they should be detected by all men. And then
when he said, “I am not the Christ,” they, being desirous to conceal what they were plotting429
<note type="footnote">428 διακρούεσθαι.</note>
<note type="footnote">429 ἐ τύρευον.</note>

<pb n="117"/>
within, go on to “Elias,” and “that Prophet.” But when he said that he was not one of these
either, after that, in their perplexity, they cast aside the mask, and without any disguise show
clearly their treacherous intention, saying, “Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that
Christ?” And then again, wishing to throw some obscurity over the thing,430 they add the
others also, “Elias,” and “that Prophet.” For when they were not able to trip431 him by their
flattery, they thought that by an accusation they could compel him432 to say the thing that
was not.</p>
<p>What folly, what insolence, what ill-timed officiousness! Ye were sent to learn who and
whence he might be, not to433 lay down laws for him also. This too was the conduct of men
who would compel him to confess himself to be the Christ. Still not even now is he angry,
nor does he, as might have been expected, say to them anything of this sort, “Do you give
orders and make laws for me?” but again shows great gentleness towards them.</p>
<p>Ver. 26, 27. “I,” saith he, “baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom
ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I
am not worthy to unloose.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> What could the Jews have left to say to this? for even from this the accusation against
them cannot be evaded, the decision against them admits not of pardon, they have given
sentence against themselves. How? In what way? They deemed John worthy of credit, and
so truthful, that they might believe him not only when he testified of others, but also when
he spoke concerning himself. For had they not been so disposed, they would not have sent
to learn from him what related to himself. Because you know that the only persons whom
we believe, especially when speaking of themselves, are those whom we suppose to be more
veracious than any others. And it is not this alone which closes their mouths, but also the
disposition with which they had approached him; for they came forth to him at first with
great eagerness, even though afterwards they altered. Both which things Christ declared,
when He said, “He was a burning (and a shining) light, and ye were willing for a season to
rejoice in his light.” Moreover, his answer made him yet more worthy of credit. For (Christ)
saith, “He that seeketh not his own glory,434 the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in
him.” Now this man sought it not, but refers the Jews to another. And those who were sent
were of the most trustworthy among them, and of the highest rank, so that they could have
in no way any refuge or excuse, for the unbelief which they exhibited towards Christ.
Wherefore did ye not receive the things spoken concerning Him by John? you sent men

<note type="footnote">431 ὑ ποσκελίσαι.</note>

<pb n="118"/>
who held the first rank among you, you enquired by them, you heard what the Baptist
answered, they manifested all possible officiousness, sought into every point, named all the
persons you suspected him to be; and yet most publicly and plainly he confessed that he
was neither “Christ,” nor “Elias” nor “that Prophet.” Nor did he stop even there, but also
informed them who he was, and spoke of the nature of his own baptism, that it was but a
slight and mean thing, nothing more than some water, and told of the superiority of the
Baptism given by Christ; he also cited Esaias the prophet, testifying of old very long ago,
and calling Christ “Lord” ( Isa. xl. 3 ), but giving him the names of “minister and servant.”
What after this ought they to have done? Ought they not to have believed on Him who was
witnessed of, to have worshiped Him, to have confessed Him to be God? For the character
and heavenly wisdom of the witness showed that his testimony proceeded, not from flattery,
but from truth; which is plain also from this, that no man prefers his neighbor to himself,
nor, when he may lawfully give honor to himself, will yield it up to another, especially when
it is so great as that of which we speak. So that John would not have renounced435 this
testimony (as belonging) to Christ, had He not been God. For though he might have rejected
it for himself as being too great for his own nature, yet he would not have assigned it to another
nature that was beneath it.</p>
<p>“But there standeth One among you, whom ye know not.” Reasonable it was that Christ
should mingle among the people as one of the many, because everywhere He taught men
not to be puffed up and boastful. And in this place by “knowledge” the Baptist means a
perfect acquaintance with Him, who and whence He was. And immediately next to this he
puts, “Who cometh after me”; all but saying, “Think not that all is contained in my baptism,
for had that been perfect, Another would not have arisen after me to offer you a different
One, but this of mine is a preparation and a clearing the way for that other. Mine is but a
shadow and image, but One must come who shall add to this the reality. So that His very
coming ‘after me’ especially declares His dignity: for had the first been perfect, no place
would have been required for a second.” “Is436 before me,” is more honorable, brighter.
And then, lest they should imagine that His superiority was found by comparison, desiring
to establish His incomparableness, he says, “Whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose”;
that is, who is not simply “before me,” but before me in such a way, that I am not
worthy to be numbered among the meanest of His servants. For to loose the shoe is the office
of humblest service.</p>
<p>Now if John was not worthy to “unloose the latchet” ( Matt. xi. 11 ), John, than whom
“among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater,” where shall we rank
ourselves? If he who was equal to, or rather greater than, all the world,437 (for saith Paul,
<note type="footnote">435 ἐ ξέστη.</note>
<note type="footnote">436 “is preferred,” E.V.</note>
<note type="footnote">437 Morel. and ms. in Bodl. “for thus Paul speaks of the saints concerning whom he writes, ‘of whom,’ etc.”</note>

<pb n="119"/>
“the world was not worthy” of them— Heb. xi. 38 ,) declares himself not worthy to be
reckoned even among the meanest of those who should minister unto Him, what shall we
say, who are full of ten thousand sins, and are as far from the excellence of John, as earth
from heaven.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> He then saith that he himself is not “worthy so much as to unloose the latchet of
His shoe”; while the enemies of the truth are mad with such a madness, as to assert438 that
they are worthy to know Him even as He knows Himself. What is worse than such insanity,
what more frenzied than such arrogance? Well hath a wise man said, “The beginning of
pride is not to know the Lord.”439</p>
<p>The devil would not have been brought down and become a devil, not being a devil
before, had he not been sick of this disease. This it was that cast him out from that confidence,
440 this sent him to the pit of fire, this was the cause of all his woes. For it is enough of
itself to destroy every excellence of the soul, whether it find almsgiving, or prayer, or fasting,
or anything. For, saith the Evangelist, “That which is highly esteemed among men is impure
before the Lord.” ( Luke xvi. 15 —not quoted exactly.) Therefore it is not only fornication
or adultery that are wont to defile those who practice them, but pride also, and that far more
than those vices. Why? Because fornication though it is an unpardonable sin, yet a man may
plead the desire; but pride cannot possibly find any cause or pretext of any sort whatever
by which to obtain so much as a shadow of excuse; it is nothing but a distortion and most
grievous disease of the soul, produced from no other source but folly. For there is nothing
more foolish than a proud man, though he be surrounded with wealth, though he possess
much of the wisdom of this world, though he be set in royal place, though he bear about
with all things that among men appear desirable.</p>
<p>For if the man who is proud of things really good is wretched and miserable, and loses
the reward of all those things, must not he who is exalted by things that are nought, and
puffs himself up because of a shadow or the flower of the grass, (for such is this world’s
glory,) be more ridiculous than any, when he does just as some poor needy man might do,
pining all his time with hunger, yet if ever he should chance one night to see a dream of
good fortune, filled with conceit because of it?</p>
<p>O wretched and miserable! when thy soul is perishing by a most grievous disease, when
thou art poor with utter poverty, art thou high-minded because thou hast such and such a
number of talents of gold? because thou hast a multitude of slaves and cattle? Yet these are

not thine; and if thou dost not believe my words, learn from the experience of those who
have gone before441 thee. And if thou art so drunken, that thou canst not be instructed even
from what has befallen others, wait a little, and thou shalt know by what befalls thyself that
these things avail thee nothing, when gasping for life, and master not of a single hour, not
even of a little moment, thou shalt unwillingly leave them442 to those who are about thee,
and these perhaps those whom thou wouldest not. For many have not been permitted even
to give directions concerning them, but have departed suddenly,443 desiring to enjoy them,
but not permitted, dragged from them, and forced to yield them up to others, giving place
by compulsion to those to whom they would not. That this be not our case, let us, while we
are yet in strength and health, send forward our riches hence to our own city, for thus only
and in no other way shall we be able to enjoy them; so shall we lay them up in a place inviolate
and safe. For there is nothing, there is nothing there that can take them from us; no
death, no attested wills,444 no successors to inheritances,445 no false informations, no plottings
against us, but he who has departed hence bearing away great wealth with him may
enjoy it there for ever. Who then is so wretched as not to desire to revel in riches which are
his own throughout? Let us then transfer our wealth, and remove it thither. We shall not
need for such a removal asses, or camels, or carriages, or ships, (God hath relieved even us
from this difficulty,) but we only want the poor, the lame, the crippled, the infirm. These
are entrusted with this transfer, these convey our riches to heaven, these introduce the
masters of such wealth as this to the inheritance of goods everlasting. Which may it be that
we all attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and
with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 28, 29</p>
<p>“These things were done in Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. The next day
he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A great virtue is boldness and freedom of speech, and the making all things second
in importance to the confessing of Christ; so great and admirable, that the Only-begotten
Son of God proclaims such an one in the presence of the Father. ( Luke xii. 8.) Yet the recompense
is more than just, for thou confessest upon earth, He in heaven, thou in the
presence of men, He before the Father and all the angels.</p>
<p>Such an one was John, who regarded not the multitude, nor opinion, nor anything else
belonging to men, but trod all this beneath his feet, and proclaimed to all with becoming
freedom the things respecting Christ. And therefore the Evangelist marks the very place, to
show the boldness of the loud-voiced herald. For it was not in a house, not in a corner, not
in the wilderness, but in the midst of the multitude, after that he had occupied Jordan, when
all that were baptized by him were present, (for the Jews came upon him as he was baptizing,)
there it was that he proclaimed aloud that wonderful confession concerning Christ, full of
those sublime and great and mysterious doctrines, and that he was not worthy to unloose
the latchet of His shoe. Wherefore he saith,446 “These things were done in Bethany,” or, as
all the more correct copies have it, “in Bethabara.” For Bethany was not “beyond Jordan,”
nor bordering on the wilderness, but somewhere nigh to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He marks the places also for another reason. Since he was not about to relate matters
of old date, but such as had come to pass but a little time before, he makes those who were
present and had beheld, witnesses of his words, and supplies proof from the places themselves.
For confident that nothing was added by himself to what was said, but that he simply and
with truth described things as they were, he draws a testimony from the places, which, as I
said, would be no common demonstration of his veracity.</p>
<p>“The next day he seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world.”</p>
<p>The Evangelists distributed the periods amongst them; and Matthew having cut short
his notice of the time before John the Baptist was bound, hastens to that which follows,
while the Evangelist John not only does not cut short this period, but dwells most on it.
Matthew, after the return of Jesus from the wilderness, saying nothing of the intermediate
circumstances, as what John spake, and what the Jews sent and said, and having cut short
<note type="footnote">446 al. “how then doth he this? adding and saying.”</note>

<pb n="122"/>
all the rest, passes immediately to the prison. “For,” saith he, “Jesus having heard” that John
was betrayed, “departed thence.” ( Matt. xiv. 13.) But John does not so. He is silent as to the
journey into the wilderness, as having been described by Matthew; but he relates what followed
the descent from the mountain, and after having gone through many circumstances,
adds, “For John was not yet cast into prison.” ( c. iii. 24 .)</p>
<p>And wherefore, says one, does Jesus now come to him? why does he come not merely
once, but this second time also? For Matthew says that His coming was necessary on account
of Baptism: since Jesus adds, that “thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.” ( Matt.
iii. 15.) But John says that He came again after Baptism, and declares it in this place, for, “I
saw,” saith he, “the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and It abode upon Him.”
Wherefore then did He come to John? for He came not casually, but went expressly to him.
“John,” saith the Evangelist, “seeth Jesus coming unto him.” Then wherefore cometh He?
In order that since John had baptized Him with many (others), no one might suppose that
He had hastened to John for the same reason as the rest to confess sins, and to wash in the
river unto repentance. For this He comes, to give John an opportunity of setting this opinion
right again, for by saying, “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world,”
he removes the whole suspicion. For very plain it is that One so pure as to be able to wash
away447 the sins of others, does not come to confess sins, but to give opportunity to that
marvelous herald to impress what he had said more definitely on those who had heard his
former words, and to add others besides. The word “Behold” is used, because many had
been seeking Him by reason of what had been said, and for a long time. For this cause,
pointing Him out when present, he said, “Behold,” this is He so long sought, this is “the
Lamb.” He calls Him “Lamb,” to remind the Jews of the prophecy of Isaiah, and of the
shadow under the law of Moses, that he may the better lead them from the type to the reality.
That Lamb of Moses took not at once away the sin of any one; but this took away the sin of
all the world; for when it was in danger of perishing, He quickly delivered it from the wrath
of God.</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “This is He of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Seest thou here also how he interprets the word “before”? for having called Him
“Lamb,” and that He “taketh away the sin of the world,” then he saith that “He is preferred
before me, for He was before me”; declaring that this is the “before,” the taking upon Him
the sins of the world, “and the baptizing with the Holy Ghost.” “For my coming had no
farther object than to proclaim the common Benefactor of the world, and to afford the
baptism of water; but His was to cleanse all men, and to give them the power of the Comforter.”
“He is preferred before me,” that is to say, has appeared brighter than I, because
<note type="footnote">447 al. “to redeem.”</note>

<pb n="123"/>
“He was before me.” Let those who have admitted the madness of Paul of Samosata be
ashamed when they withstand so manifest a truth.</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “And I knew Him not,” he saith.</p>
<p>Here he renders his testimony free from suspicion, by showing that it was not from
human friendship, but had been caused by divine revelation. “I knew Him not,” he saith.
How then couldest thou be a trustworthy witness? How shalt thou teach others, while thou
thyself art ignorant? He did not say “I know Him not,” but, “I knew Him not”; so that in
this way he would be shown most trustworthy; for why should he have shown favor to one
of whom he was ignorant?</p>
<p>“But that He should be made manifest unto Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with
water.”</p>
<p>He then did not need baptism, nor had that laver any other object than to prepare for
all others a way to faith on Christ. For he did not say, “that I might cleanse those who are
baptized,” or, “that I might deliver them from their sins,” but, “that He should be made
manifest unto lsrael.” “And why, tell me, could he not without baptism have preached and
brought the multitudes to Him?” But in this way it would not have been by any means easy.
For they would not so all have run together, if the preaching had been without the baptism;
they would not by the comparison have learned His superiority. For the multitude came
together not to hear his words, but for what? To be “baptized, confessing their sins.” But
when they came, they were taught the matters concerning Christ, and the difference of His
baptism. Yet even this of John was of greater dignity than the Jewish, and therefore all ran
to it; yet even so it was imperfect.</p>
<p>“How then didst thou know Him?” “By the descent of the Spirit,” he saith. But again,
lest any one should suppose that he was in need of the Spirit as we are, hear how he removes
the suspicion, by showing that the descent of the Spirit was only to declare Christ. For having
said, “And I knew Him not,” he adds, “But He that sent me to baptize with water the Same
said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the
same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.” ( Ver. 33.)</p>
<p>Seest thou that this was the work of the Spirit, to point out Christ? The testimony of
John was indeed not to be suspected, but wishing to make it yet more credible, he leads it
up to God and the Holy Spirit. For when John had testified to a thing so great and wonderful,
so fit to astonish all his hearers, that He alone took on Him the sins of all the world, and
that the greatness of the gift sufficed for so great a ransom, afterwards he proves this assertion.
448 And the proof is that He is the Son of God, and that He needed not baptism, and that
the object of the descent of the Spirit was only to make Him known. For it was not in the
power of John to give the Spirit, as those who were baptized by him show when they say,
<note type="footnote">448 ἀ πόφασιν.</note>

<pb n="124"/>
“We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.” ( Acts xix. 2.) In truth,
Christ needed not baptism, neither his nor any other; 449 but rather baptism needed the
power of Christ. For that which was wanting was the crowning blessing of all, that he who
was baptized should be deemed worthy of the Spirit; this free gift450 then of the Spirit He
added when He came.</p>
<p>Ver. 32–34. “And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from the heaven
like a dove, and It abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize
with water, the Same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and
bare record that this is the Son of God.”</p>
<p>He puts the “I knew Him not” repeatedly.451 On what account, and wherefore? He was
His kinsman according to the flesh. “Behold,” saith the angel, “thy cousin Elisabeth, she also
hath received a son.” ( Luke i. 36.) That therefore he might not seem to favor Him because
of the relationship, he repeats the “I knew Him not.” And this happened with good reason;
for he had passed all his time in the wilderness away from his father’s house.</p>
<p>How then, if he knew Him not before the descent of the Spirit, and if he then for the
first time recognized Him, did he forbid Him before baptism, saying, “I have need to be
baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?” ( Matt. iii. 14 ), since this was a proof that he
knew Him very well. Yet he knew Him not before or for a long time, and with good cause;
for the marvels which took place when He was a child, as the circumstances of the Magi and
others the like, had happened long before, while John himself was very young, and since
much time had elapsed in the interval, He was naturally unknown to all. For had He been
known, John would not have said, “That He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore
am I come baptizing.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Hence it remains clear to us, that the miracles which they say belong to Christ’s
childhood, are false, and the inventions of certain who bring them into notice. For if He
had begun from His early age to work wonders, neither could John have been ignorant of
Him, nor would the multitude have needed a teacher to make Him known. But now he says,
that for this he is come, “that He might be made manifest to Israel”; and for this reason he
said again, “I have need to be baptized of Thee.” Afterwards, as having gained more exact
knowledge of Him, he proclaimed Him to the multitude, saying, “This is He of whom I said,
After me cometh a Man which is preferred before me.” For “He who sent me to baptize with
water,” and sent me for this end, “that He should be made manifest to Israel,” Himself revealed
Him even before the descent of the Spirit. Wherefore even before He came, John
<note type="footnote">449 or, “of any other man.”</note>
<note type="footnote">450 χορηγία.</note>
<note type="footnote">451 συνεχῶς.</note>

<pb n="125"/>
said, “One cometh after me who is preferred before me.” He knew Him not before he came
to Jordan and baptized all men, but when He was about to be baptized, then he knew Him;
and this from the Father revealing Him to the Prophet, and the Spirit showing Him when
He was being baptized to the Jews, for whose sake indeed the descent of the Spirit took place.
For that the witness of John might not be despised who said, that “He was before me,” and
that “He baptizeth with the Spirit,” and that “He judgeth the world,” the Father utters a
Voice proclaiming the Son, and the Spirit descends, directing452 that Voice to the Head of
Jesus. For since one was baptizing, the other receiving baptism, the Spirit comes to correct
the idea which some of those present might form, that the words were spoken of John. So
that when he says, “I knew Him not,” he speaks of former time, not that near to His baptism.
Otherwise how could he have forbidden Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized of Thee”?
How could he have said such words concerning Him?</p>
<p>“But,” says one, “how then did not the Jews believe? for it was not John only that saw
the Spirit in the likeness of a dove.” It was, because, even if they did see, such things require
not only the eyes of the body, but more than these, the vision of the understanding, to prevent
men from supposing the whole to be a vain illusion. For if when they saw Him working
wonders, touching with His own hands the sick and the dead, and so bringing them back
to life and health, they were so drunk with malice as to declare the contrary of what they
saw; how could they shake off their unbelief by the descent of the Spirit only? And some
say, that they did not all see it, but only John and those of them who were better453 disposed.
Because even though it were possible with fleshly eyes to see the Spirit descending as in the
likeness of a dove, still not for this was it absolutely necessary that the circumstance should
be visible to all. For Zacharias saw many things in a sensible form, as did Daniel and Ezekiel,
and had none to share in what they saw; Moses also saw many things such as none other
hath seen; nor did all the disciples enjoy454 the view of the Transfiguration on the mount,
nor did they all alike behold Him at the time of the Resurrection. And this Luke plainly
shows, when he says, that He showed Himself “to witnesses chosen before of God.” ( Acts
x. 41.)</p>
<p>“And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.”</p>
<p>Where did he “bear record that this is the Son of God?” he called Him indeed “Lamb,”
and said that He should “baptize with the Spirit,” but nowhere did he say of Him, “Son of
God.” But the other Evangelists do not write that He said anything after the baptism, but
having been silent as to the time intervening, they mention the miracles of Christ which
were done after John’s captivity,455 whence we may reasonably conjecture that these and
<note type="footnote">452 ἔ πελκον.</note>
<note type="footnote">453 εὐγνωμονέστερον.</note>
<note type="footnote">454 al. “were thought worthy.”</note>
<note type="footnote">455 σύλληψιν.</note>

<pb n="126"/>
many others are omitted. And this our Evangelist himself has declared, at the end of his
narrative. For they were so far from inventing anything great concerning Him, that the
things which seem to bring reproach, these they have all with one voice456 and with all exactness
set down, and you will not find one of them omitting one of such circumstances;
but of the miracles, part some have left for the others to relate,457 part all have passed over
in silence.</p>
<p>I say not this without cause, but to answer the shamelessness of the heathen.458 For this
is a sufficient proof of their truth-loving disposition, and that they say nothing for favor.
And thus as well as in other ways you may arm yourselves for trial of argument459 with
them. But take heed. Strange were it that the physician, or the shoemaker, or the weaver, in
short all artists, should be able each to contend correctly for his own art, but that one calling
himself Christian should not be able to give a reason for his own faith; yet those things if
overlooked bring only loss to men’s property, these if neglected destroy our very souls. Yet
such is our wretched disposition, that we give all our care to the former, and the things
which are necessary, and which are the groundwork460 of our salvation, as though of little
worth, we despise.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> That it is which prevents the heathen from quickly deriding his own error. For when
they, though established in a lie, use every means to conceal the shamefulness of their
opinions, while we, the servants of the truth, cannot even open our mouths, how can they
help condemning the great weakness of our doctrine? how can they help suspecting our
religion to be fraud and folly? how shall they not blaspheme Christ as a deceiver, and a cheat,
who used the folly of the many to further his fraud? And we are to blame for this blasphemy,
because we will not be wakeful in arguments for godliness, but deem these things superfluous,
and care only for the things of earth. He who admires a dancer or a charioteer, or one who
contends with beasts, uses every exertion and contrivance not to come off worst in any disputes
concerning him, and they string together long panegyrics, as they compose their defense
against those who find fault with them, and cast sneers without number at their opponents:
but when arguments for Christianity are proposed, they all hang their heads, and scratch
themselves, and gape, and retire at length the objects of contempt.</p>
<p>Must not this deserve excessive wrath, when Christ is shown to be less honorable in
your estimation than a dancer? since you have contrived ten thousand defenses for the
things they have done, though more disgraceful than any, but of the miracles of Christ,

though they have drawn to Him the world, you cannot bear even to think or care at all. We
believe in the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, in the Resurrection of bodies, and
in Life everlasting. If now any heathen say, “What is this Father, what this Son, what this
Holy Ghost? How do you who say that there are three Gods, charge us with having many
Gods?” What will you say? What will you answer? How will you repel the attack of these
arguments? But what if when you are silent, the unbeliever should again propose this other
question, and ask, “What in a word is resurrection? Shall we rise again in this body? or in
another, different from this? If in this, what need that it be dissolved?” What will you answer?
And what, if he say, “Why did Christ come now and not in old time? Has it seemed good
to Him now to care for men, and did He despise us during all the years that are past?” Or
if he ask other questions besides, more than these? for I must not propose many questions,
and be silent as to the answers to them, lest, in so doing, I harm the simpler among you.
What has been already said is sufficient to shake off your slumbers. Well then, if they ask
these questions, and you absolutely cannot even listen to the words, shall we, tell me, suffer
trifling punishment only, when we have been the cause of such error to those who sit in
darkness? I wished, if you had sufficient leisure, to bring before you all the book of a certain
impure heathen philosopher written against us, and that of another of earlier date, that so
at least I might have roused you, and led you away from your exceeding slothfulness. For if
they were wakeful that they might say these things against us, what pardon can we deserve,
if we do not even know how to repel the attacks made upon us? For what purpose have we
been brought forward?461 Dost thou not hear the Apostle say, “Be ready to give an answer
to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you”? ( 1 Pet. iii. 15.) And Paul
exhorts in like manner, saying, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.” ( Col. iii. 16.)
What do they who are more slothful462 than drones reply to this? “Blessed is every simple
soul,” and, “he that walketh simply463 walketh surely.” ( Prov. x. 8.) For this is the cause of
all sorts of evil, that the many do not know how to apply rightly even the testimony of the
Scriptures. Thus in this place, the writer does not mean (by “simple”) the man who is foolish,
or who knows nothing, but him who is free from wickedness, who is no evil-doer, who is
wise. If it were not so, it would have been useless to say,464 “Be ye wise as serpents, and
harmless as doves.” ( Matt. x. 16.) But why should I name these things, when the discourse
comes in quite out of place? For besides the things already mentioned, other matters are
not right with us, those, I mean, which concern our life and conversation. We are in every
way wretched and ridiculous, ever ready to find fault with each other, but slow to correct

in ourselves things for which we blame and accuse our neighbor. Wherefore I exhort you,
that now at least we attend to ourselves, and stop not at the finding fault, (this is not enough
to appease God;) but that we show forth a change in every way most excellent, in order that
having lived here to the glory of God, we may enjoy the glory to come; which may it come
to pass that we will all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 35–37</p>
<p>“Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; and looking upon Jesus as He
walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speak, and
they followed Jesus.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The nature of man is somehow a thing slothful, and easily declining to perdition,
not by reason of the constitution of the nature itself, but by reason of that sloth which is of
deliberate choice. Wherefore it needs much reminding. And for this cause Paul, writing to
the Philippians, said, “To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but
for you it is safe.” ( Philip. iii. 1 .)</p>
<p>The earth when it has once received the seed, straightway gives forth its fruits, and needs
not a second sowing; but with our souls it is not so, and one must be content, after having
sown many times, and manifested much carefulness, to be able once to receive fruit. For in
the first place, what is said settles in the mind with difficulty, because the ground is very
hard, and entangled with thorns innumerable, and there are many which lay plots, and carry
away the seed; afterwards, when it has been fixed and has taken root, it still needs the same
attention, that it may come to maturity, and having done so may remain uninjured, and
take no harm from any. For in the case of seeds, when the ear is fully formed and has gained
its proper strength, it easily despises rust, and drought, and every other thing; but it is not
so with doctrines; in their case after all the work has been fully done, one storm and flood
often comes on, and either by the attack of unpleasant circumstances, or by the plots of men
skilled to deceive, or by various other temptations brought against them, brings them to
ruin.</p>
<p>I have not said this without cause, but that when you hear John repeating the same
words, you may not condemn him for vain talking;465 nor deem him impertinent or
wearisome. He desired to have been heard by once speaking, but because not many gave
heed to what was spoken from the first, by reason of deep sleep, he again rouses them by
this second call. Now observe; he had said, “He that cometh after me, is preferred before
me”: and that “I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe”; and that “He baptizeth
with the Holy Ghost, and with fire”; and that he “saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and
it abode upon Him,” and he “bare record that this is the Son of God.” No one gave heed,
nor asked, nor said, “Why sayest thou these things? in whose behalf? for what reason?”
Again he had said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”; yet
not even so did he touch their insensibility. Therefore, after this he is compelled to repeat
<note type="footnote">465 al. “want of taste.”</note>

<pb n="130"/>
the same words again, as if softening by tillage 466 some hard and stubborn soil, and by his
word as by a467 plow, disturbing the mind which had hardened into clods,468 so as to put
in the seed deep. For this reason he does not make his discourse a long one either; because
he desired one thing only, to bring them over and join them to Christ. He knew that as soon
as they had received this saying, and had been persuaded, they would not afterwards need
one to bear witness unto Him. As also it came to pass. For, if the Samaritans could say to
the woman after hearing Him, “Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we know that
this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world,” the disciples would be much more quickly
subdued,469 as was the case. For when they had come and heard Him but one evening, they
returned no more to John, but were so nailed to Him, that they took upon them the ministry
of John, and themselves proclaimed Him. For, saith the Evangelist, “He findeth his own
brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted,
the Christ.” And observe, I pray you, this, how, when he said, “He that cometh after me is
preferred before me”; and that, “I am not worthy to unloose the lachet of His shoe”; he
caught no one, but when he spoke of the Dispensation, and lowered his discourse to a
humbler tone, then the disciples followed Him.</p>
<p>And we may remark this, not only in the instance of the disciples, but that the many
are not so much attracted when some great and sublime thing is said concerning God, as
when some act of graciousness and lovingkindness, something pertaining to the salvation
of the hearers, is spoken of. They heard that “He taketh away the sin of the world,” and
straightway they ran to Him. For, said they, “if it is possible to wash away470 the charges
that lie against us, why do we delay? here is One who will deliver us without labor of ours.
Is it not extreme folly to put off accepting the Gift?” Let those hear who are Catechumens,
and are putting off their salvation471 to their latest breath.</p>
<p>“Again,” saith the Evangelist, “John stood, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God.” Christ
utters no word, His messenger saith all. So it is with a bridegroom. He saith not for a while
anything to the bride, but is there in silence, while some show him to the bride, and others
give her into his hands; she merely appears, and he departs not having taken her himself,
but when he has received her from another who gives her to him. And when he has received
her thus given, he so disposes her, that she no more remembers those who betrothed her.

<note type="footnote">471 i.e. their baptism.</note>

<pb n="131"/>
So it was with Christ. He came to join to Himself the Church; He said nothing, but merely
came. It was His friend, John, who put into His the bride’s right hand, when by his discourses
he gave into His hand the souls of men. He having received them, afterwards so disposed
them, that they departed no more to John who had committed them to Him.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And here we may remark, not this only, but something besides. As at a marriage
the maiden goes not to the bridegroom, but he hastens to her, though he be a king’s son,
and though he be about to espouse some poor and abject person, or even a servant, so it
was here. Man’s nature did not go up,472 but contemptible and poor as it was, He came to
it, and when the marriage had taken place, He suffered it no longer to tarry here, but having
taken it to Himself, transported it to the house of His Father.</p>
<p>“Why then doth not John take his disciples apart, and converse with them on these
matters, and so deliver them over to Christ, instead of saying publicly to them in common
with all the people, ‘Behold the Lamb of God’?” That it may not seem to be a matter of arrangement;
for had they gone away from him to Christ after having been privately admonished
by him, and as though to do him a favor, they would perhaps soon have started away
again; but now, having taken upon them the following Him, from teaching which had been
general, they afterwards remained His firm disciples, as not having followed Him in order
to gratify the teacher, but as looking purely to their own advantage.</p>
<p>The Prophets and Apostles then all preached Him absent; the Prophets before His
coming according to the flesh, the Apostles after He was taken up; John alone proclaimed
Him present. Wherefore he calls himself the “friend of the Bridegroom” ( c. iii. 29 ), since
he alone was present at the marriage, he it was that did and accomplished all, he made a
beginning of the work. And “looking upon Jesus walking, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
God.” Not by voice alone, but with his eyes also he bore witness to, and expressed his admiration
of, Christ, rejoicing and glorying. Nor does he for awhile address any473 word of exhortation
to his followers, but only shows wonder and astonishment at Him who was present,
and declares to all the Gift which He came to give, and the manner of purification. For “the
Lamb” declares both these things. And he said not, “Who shall take,” or “Who hath taken”;
but, “Who taketh away the sins of the world”; because this He ever doth. He took them not
then only when He suffered, but from that time even to the present doth He take them away,
not being repeatedly474 crucified, (for He offered One Sacrifice for sins,) but by that One
continually purging them. As then The Word shows us His pre-eminence,475 and The Son
His superiority in comparison with others, so “The Lamb, The Christ, that Prophet, the
<note type="footnote">472 al. “depart.”</note>
<note type="footnote">473 al. “even any.”</note>

<note type="footnote">475 τὸ ἐξαίρετον.</note>

<pb n="132"/>
True Light, the Good Shepherd,” and whatever other names are applied to Him with the
addition of the article, mark a great difference. For there were many “Lambs,” and “Prophets,”
and “Christs,” and “sons,” but from all these John separates Him by a wide interval. And
this he secured not by the article only, but by the addition of “Only-Begotten”; for He had
nothing in common with the creation.</p>
<p>If it seems to any unseasonable that these things should be spoken at “the tenth hour”
(that was the time of day, for he says, “It was about the tenth hour”—( v. 39 ), such an one
seems to me to be much mistaken. In the case indeed of the many, and those who serve the
flesh, the season after feasting is not very suitable for any matters of pressing moment, because
their hearts476 are burdened with meats: but here was a man who did not even partake of
common food, and who at evening was as sober as we are at morning, (or rather much more
so; for often the remains of our evening food that are left within us, fill our souls with imaginations,
but he loaded his vessel with none of these things;) he with good reason spake
late in the evening of these matters. Besides, he was tarrying in the wilderness by Jordan,
where all came to his baptism with great fear, and caring little at that time for the things of
this life; as also they continued with Christ three days, and had nothing to eat. ( Matt. xv.
32.) For this is the part of a zealous herald and a careful husbandman, not to desist before
he see that the planted seed has got a firm hold.477 “Why then did he not go about all the
parts of Judæa preaching Christ, rather than stand by the river waiting for Him to come,
that he might point Him out when He came?” Because he wished that this should be effected
by His works; his own object being in the mean time only to make Him known, and to
persuade some to hear of eternal life. But to Him he leaves the greater testimony, that of
works, as also He saith, “I receive not testimony of men. The works which My Father hath
given Me, the same bear witness of Me.” ( c. v. 34, 36.) Observe how much more effectual
this was; for when he had thrown in a little spark, at once the blaze rose on high. For they
who before had not even given heed to his words, afterwards say, “All things which John
spake were true.” ( c. x. 41.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Besides, if he had gone about saying these things, what was being done would have
seemed to be done from some human motive, and the preaching to be full of suspicion.478</p>
<p>“And the two disciples heard him, and followed Jesus.”</p>
<p>Yet John had other disciples, but they not only did not “follow Jesus,” but were even
jealously disposed towards him. “Rabbi,” says one, “He that was with thee beyond Jordan,
to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come unto him.” ( c.
iii. 26.) And again479 they appear bringing a charge against him; “Why do we fast, but thy
<note type="footnote">476 or, “stomachs.”</note>
<note type="footnote">477 al. “is retained.”</note>
<note type="footnote">478 Morel. reads: καὶ ὑποψίας ἦν μετὰ τὸ κήρυγμα λοιπόν.</note>

<pb n="133"/>
disciples fast not?” ( Matt. ix. 14.) But those who were better than the rest had no such feeling,
but heard, and at once followed; followed, not as despising their teacher, but as being most
fully persuaded by him, and producing the strongest proof that they acted thus from a right
judgment of his reasonings. For they did not do so by his advice, that might have appeared
suspicious; but when he merely foretold what was to come to pass, that “He should baptize
with the Holy Ghost, <del>and with fire,</del>” they followed. They did not then desert their teacher,
but rather desired to learn what Christ brought with Him more than John. And observe
zeal combined with modesty. They did not at once approach and question Jesus on necessary
and most important matters, nor were they desirous to converse with Him publicly, while
all were present, at once and in an off-hand manner, but privately; for they knew that the
words of their teacher proceeded not from humility, but from truth.</p>
<p>Ver. 40. “One of the two who heard, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s
brother.”</p>
<p>Wherefore then has he not made known the name of the other also? Some say, because
it was the writer himself that followed; others, not so, but that he was not one of the distinguished
disciples; it behooved not therefore to say more than was necessary. For what would
it have advantaged us to learn his name, when the writer does not mention the names even
of the seventy-two? St. Paul also did the same.480 “We have sent,” says he, “with him the
brother,” (who has often in many things been forward,) “whose praise is in the Gospel.” (
2 Cor. viii. 18.) Moreover, he mentions Andrew for another reason. What is this? It is, that
when you are informed that Simon having in company with him heard, “Follow Me, and I
will make you fishers of men” ( Matt. iv. 19 ), was not perplexed at so strange a promise,
you may learn that his brother had already laid down within him the beginnings of the faith.
Ver. 38. “Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek
ye?”</p>
<p>Hence we are taught, that God does not prevent our wills by His gifts, but that when
we begin, when we provide the being willing, then He gives us many opportunities of salvation.
“What seek ye?” How is this? He who knoweth the hearts of men, who dwelleth481 in
our thoughts, doth He ask? He doth; not that He may be informed; how could that be? but
that by the question He may make them more familiar, and impart to them greater boldness,
and show them that they are worthy to hear Him; for it was probable that they would blush
and be afraid, as being unknown to him, and as having heard such accounts of Him from
the testimony of their teacher. Therefore to remove all this, their shame and their fear, he
questions them, and would not let them come all the way to the house in silence. Yet the
event would have been the same had He not questioned them; they would have remained
<note type="footnote">480 Morel. and ms. in Bodl. “this also may be seen with Paul.”</note>
<note type="footnote">481 ἐ υβατεύων.</note>

<pb n="134"/>
by following Him, and walking in His steps would have reached His dwelling. Why then
did He ask? To effect that which I said, to calm their minds,482 yet disturbed with shame
and anxiety, and to give them confidence.</p>
<p>Nor was it by their following only that they showed their earnest desire, but by their
question also: for when they had not as yet learned or even heard anything from Him, they
call Him, “Master”; thrusting themselves as it were among His disciples, and declaring what
was the cause of their following, that they might hear somewhat profitable. Observe their
wisdom also. They did not say, “Teach us of Thy doctrines, or some other thing that we
need to know”; but what? “Where dwellest Thou?” Because, as I before said, they wished in
quiet to say somewhat to Him, and to hear somewhat from Him, and to learn. Therefore
they did not defer the matter, nor say, “We will come to-morrow by all means, and hear
thee speak in public”; but showed the great eagerness they had to hear Him, by not being
turned back even by the hour, for the sun was already near its setting, (“it was,” saith John,
“about the tenth hour.”) And therefore Christ does not tell them the marks of His abode,
nor its situation, but rather induces them to follow Him by showing them that He had accepted
them. For this reason He did not say anything of this kind to them, “It is an unseasonable
time now for you to enter into the house, to-morrow you shall hear if you have any
wish, return home now”;483 but converses with them as with friends, and those who had
long been with Him.</p>
<p>How then saith He in another place, “But the Son of Man hath not where to lay His
head” ( Luke ix. 58 ), while here He saith, “Come and see” ( v. 39 ) where I abide? Because
the expression “hath not where to lay His head,” signifies that He had no dwelling place of
His own, not that He did not abide in a house. And this too is the meaning of the comparison.
484 The Evangelist has mentioned that “they abode with Him that day,” but has not added
wherefore, because the reason was plain; for from no other motive did they follow Christ,
and He draw them to Him, but only that they might have instruction; and this they enjoyed
so abundantly and eagerly even in a single night, that they both proceeded straightway to
the capture485 of others.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us then also learn hence to consider all things secondary486 to the hearing the
word of God, and to deem no season unseasonable, and, though a man may even have to
go into another person’s house, and being a person unknown to make himself known to
great men, though it be late in the day, or at any time whatever, never to neglect this traffic.

Let food and baths and dinners and the other things of this life have their appointed time;
but let the teaching of heavenly philosophy have no separate time, let every season belong
to it. For Paul saith, “In season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort” ( 2 Tim. iv. 2 ); and
the Prophet too saith,487 “In His law will he meditate day and night” ( Ps. i. 3 ); and Moses
commanded the Jews to do this always. For the things of this life, baths, I mean, and dinners,
even if they are necessary, yet being continually repeated, render the body feeble;488 but the
teaching of the soul the more it is prolonged, the stronger it renders the soul which receives
it. But now we portion out all our time for trifles and unprofitable silly talking, and we sit
together idly during the morning and afternoon,489 midday and evening besides, and we
have appointed places for this; but hearing the divine doctrines twice or thrice in the week
we become sick,490 and thoroughly sated. What is the reason? We are in a bad state of soul;
its faculty of desiring and reaching after these things we have relaxed altogether. And
therefore it is not strong enough to have an appetite for spiritual food. And this among
others is a great proof of weakness, not to hunger nor thirst, but to be disinclined to both.
Now if this, when it takes place in our bodies, is a sure sign of grievous disease, and productive
of weakness, much more is it so in the soul.</p>
<p>“How then,” says one, “shall we be able to renew it, thus fallen and relaxed, to strength?
what doing, what saying?” By applying ourselves to the divine words of the prophets, of the
Apostles, of the Gospels, and all the others; then we shall know that it is far better to feed
on these than on impure food, for so we must term our unseasonable idle talking and assemblies.
For which is best, tell me, to converse on things relating to the market, or things in
the law courts, or in the camp, or on things in heaven, and on what shall be after our departure
hence? Which is best, to talk about our neighbor and our neighbor’s affairs, to busy
ourselves in what belongs to other people, or to enquire into the things of angels, and into
matters which concern ourselves? For a neighbor’s affairs are not thine at all; but heavenly
things are thine. “But,” says some one, “a man may by once speaking finish these subjects
altogether.” Why do you not think this in matters on which you converse uselessly and idly,
why though ye waste your lives on this have ye never exhausted the subject? And I have not
yet named what is far more vile than this. These are the things about which the better sort
converse one with the other; but the more indifferent and careless carry about in their talk
players and dancers and charioteers, defiling men’s ears, corrupting their souls, and driving
their nature into mad excesses by these narratives, and by means of this discourse introducing
every kind of wickedness into their own imagination. For as soon as the tongue has uttered

the name of the dancer, immediately the soul has figured to itself his looks, his hair, his
delicate clothing, and himself more effeminate than all. Another again fans the flame in
another way, by introducing some harlot into the conversation, with her words, and attitudes,
and glances, her languishing looks and twisted locks, the smoothness of her cheeks, and her
painted eyelids.491 Were you not somewhat affected when I gave this description? Yet be
not ashamed, nor blush, for the very necessity of nature requires this, and so disposes the
soul according as the tendency of what is said may be. But if, when it is I that speak, you,
standing in the church, and at a distance from these things, were somewhat affected at the
hearing, consider how it is likely that they are disposed, who sit in the theater itself, who are
totally free from dread, who are absent from this venerable and awful assembly, who both
see and hear those things with much shamelessness. “And why then,” perhaps one of those
who heed not may say, “if the necessity of nature so disposes the soul, do you let go that,
and blame us?” Because, to be softened492 when one hears these things, is nature’s work;
but to hear them is not a fault of nature, but of deliberate choice. For so he who meddles
with fire must needs be injured, so wills the weakness of our nature; yet nature does not
therefore draw us to the fire and to the injury thence arising; this can be only from deliberate
perversity. I beseech you, therefore, to remove and correct this fault, that you may not of
your own accord cast yourself down the precipice, nor thrust yourselves into the pits of
wickedness, nor run of yourselves to the blaze, lest we place ourselves in jeopardy of the fire
prepared for the devil. May it come to pass, that we all being delivered both from this fire
and from that, may go to the very bosom of Abraham, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and Holy Ghost, be glory
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 41, 42</p>
<p>“He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias,
which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> When God in the beginning made man, He did not suffer him to be alone, but gave
him woman for a helpmate, and made them to dwell together, knowing that great advantage
would result from this companionship. What though the woman did not rightly employ
this benefit? still if any one make himself fully acquainted with the nature of the matter, he
will see, that to the wise great advantage arises from this dwelling together; not in the cause
of wife or husband only, but if brothers do this, they also shall enjoy the benefit. Wherefore
the Prophet hath said, “What is good, what is pleasant, but that brethren should dwell together?”
( Ps. cxxxiii. 1 , LXX.) And Paul exhorted not to neglect the assembling of ourselves
together. ( Heb. x. 25.) In this it is that we differ from beasts, for this we have built cities,
and markets, and houses, that we may be united one with another, not in the place of our
dwelling only, but by the bond of love. For since our nature came imperfect493 from Him
who made it, and is not self-sufficient,494 God, for our advantage, ordained that the want
hence existing should be corrected by the assistance arising from mutual intercourse; so
that what was lacking in one should be supplied by another,495 and the defective nature
thus be rendered self-sufficient; as, for instance, that though made mortal,496 it should by
succession for a long time maintain immortality. I might have gone into this argument at
greater length, to show what advantages arise to those who come together from genuine
and pure497 intercourse with each other: but there is another thing which presses now, that
on account of which we have made these remarks.</p>
<p>Andrew, after having tarried with Jesus and learned what He did, kept not the treasure
to himself, but hastens and runs quickly to his brother, to impart to him of the good things
which he had received.498 But wherefore has not John said on what matters Christ conversed
with them? Whence is it clear that it was for this that they “abode with Him”?499 It was

proved by us the other day; but we may learn it from what has been read today as well. Observe
what Andrew says to his brother; “We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted,
the Christ.” You see how, as far as he had learned in a short time, he showed500 the
wisdom of the teacher who persuaded them, and their own zeal, who cared for these things
long ago,501 and from the beginning. For this word, “we have found,” is the expression of
a soul which travails502 for His presence, and looks for His coming from above, and is made
overjoyed when the looked-for thing has happened,503 and hastens to impart to others the
good tidings. This is the part of brotherly affection, of natural friendship, of a sincere disposition,
to be eager to stretch out the hand to each other in spiritual things. Hear him besides
speak with the addition of the article; for he does not say “Messias,” but “the Messias”; thus
they were expecting some one Christ,504 having nothing in common with the others. And
behold, I beg of you, the mind of Peter obedient and tractable from the very beginning; he
ran to Him without any delay; “He brought him,” saith St. John, “to Jesus.” Yet let no one
blame his easy temper if he received the word without much questioning, because it is
probable that his brother had told him these things more exactly and at length; but the
Evangelists from their care for conciseness constantly cut many things short. Besides, it is
not said absolutely that “he believed,” but that “he brought him to Jesus,” to give him up
for the future to Him, so that from Him he might learn all; for the other disciple also was
with him, and contributed to this. And if John the Baptist, when he had said that He was
“the Lamb,” and that He “baptized with the Spirit,” gave them over to learn the clearer
doctrine concerning this thing from Him, much more would Andrew have done this, not
deeming him self sufficient to declare the whole, but drawing him to the very fount of light
with so much zeal and joy, that the other505 neither deferred nor delayed at all.506</p>
<p>Ver. 42. “And when Jesus beheld him,” saith the Evangelist, “He said, Thou art Simon,
the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a stone.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> He begins from this time forth to reveal the things belonging to His Divinity, and
to open It out little by little by predictions. So He did in the case of Nathaniel and the
Samaritan woman. For prophecies bring men over not less than miracles; and are free from
the appearance of boasting. Miracles may possibly be slandered among foolish men, (“He
casteth out devils,” said they, “by Beelzebub”— Matt. xii. 24 ), but nothing of the kind has

ever been said of prophecy. Now in the case of Nathaniel and Simon He used this method
of teaching, but with Andrew and Philip He did not so. Why was this? Because those507
(two) had the testimony of John, no small preparation, and Philip received a credible evidence
of faith, when he saw those who had been present.</p>
<p>“Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas.” By the present, the future is guaranteed; for it is
clear that He who named Peter’s father foreknew the future also. And the prediction is attended
with praise; but the object was not to flatter, but to foretell something future. Hear508
at least in the case of the Samaritan woman, how He utters a prediction with severe reproofs;
509 “Thou hast had,” he saith, “five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy
husband.” ( c. iv. 18.) So also His Father makes great account of prophecy, when He sets
Himself against the honor paid to idols: “Let them declare to you,” saith He, “what shall
come upon you” ( Isa. xlvii. 13 ); and again, “I have declared, and have saved, and there was
no foreign God amongst you” ( Isa. xliii. 12 , LXX.); and He brings this forward through
all prophecy. Because prophecy is especially the work of God, which devils cannot even
imitate, though they strive exceedingly. For in the case of miracles there may be delusion;
but exactly to foretell the future belongs to that pure Nature alone. Or if devils ever have
done so, it was by deceiving the simpler sort; whence their oracles are always easily detected.</p>
<p>But Peter makes no reply to these words; as yet he knew nothing clearly, but still was
learning. And observe, that not even the prediction is fully set forth; for Jesus did not say,
“I will change thy name to Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church,” but, “Thou
shalt be called Cephas.” The former speech would have expressed too great authority510
and power; for Christ does not immediately nor at first declare all His power, but speaks
for a while in a humbler tone; and so, when He had given the proof of His Divinity, He puts
it more authoritatively, saying,511 “Blessed art thou, Simon, because My Father hath revealed
it to thee”; and again, “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church.” ( Matt.
xvi. 17, 18.) Him therefore He so named, and James and his brother He called “sons of
thunder.” ( Mark iii. 17.) Why then doth He this? To show that it was He who gave the old
covenant, that it was He who altered names, who called Abram “Abraham,” and Sarai
“Sarah,” and Jacob “Israel.” To many he assigned names even from their birth, as to Isaac,
and Samson, and to those in Isaiah and Hosea ( Isa. viii. 3; Hos. i. 4, 6, 9 ); but to others He
gave them after they had been named by their parents, as to those we have mentioned, and

to Joshua the son of Nun. It was also a custom of the Ancients to give names from things,
which in fact Leah also has done;512 and this takes place not without cause, but in order
that men may have the appellation to remind them of the goodness of God, that a perpetual
memory of the prophecy conveyed by the names may sound in the ears of those who receive
it. Thus too He named John early,513 because they whose virtue was to shine forth from
their early youth, from that time received their names; while to those who were to become
great514 at a later period, the title also was given later.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But then they received each a different name, we now have all one name, that which
is greater than any, being called515 “Christians,” and “sons of God,” and (His) “friends,”
and (His) “Body.” For the very term itself is able more than all those others to rouse us, and
make us more zealous516 for the practice of virtue. Let us not then act unworthily of the
honor belonging to the title, considering517 the excess of our dignity, we who are called
Christ’s; for so Paul hath named us. Let us bear in mind and respect the grandeur of the
appellation. ( 1 Cor. iii. 23.) For if one who is said to be descended from some famous general,
or one otherwise distinguished, is proud to be called this or that man’s son, and deems
the name a great honor, and strives in every way so as not to affix, by remissness of his own,
reproach to him after whom he is called; shall not we who are called after the name, not of
a general, nor any of the princes upon earth, nor Angel, nor Archangel, nor Seraphim, but
of the King of these Himself, shall not we freely give even our very life, so as not to insult
Him who has honored us? Know ye not what honor the royal bands of shield-bearers and
spearmen that are about the king enjoy? So let us who have been deemed worthy to be near
Him, and much closer, and as much nearer than those just named, as the body is closer to
the head than they, let us, I say, use every means to be imitators of Christ.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “The foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the
Son of man hath not where to lay His head.” ( Luke ix. 58.) Now if I demand this of you, it
will seem perhaps to most of you grievous and burdensome; because therefore of your infirmity
I speak not of518 such perfection, but desire you not to be nailed to riches; and as I,
because of the infirmity of the many, retire somewhat from (demanding) the excess of virtue,

I desire that you do so and much more on the side of vice. I blame not those who have
houses, and lands, and wealth, and servants, but wish them to possess519 these things in a
safe and becoming way. And what is “a becoming way”? As masters, not as slaves; so that
they rule them, be not ruled by them; that they use, not abuse them. This is why they are
called, “things to be used,”520 that we may employ them on necessary services, not hoard
them up; this is a domestic’s office, that a master’s; it is for the slave to keep them, but for
the lord and one who has great authority to expend. Thou didst not receive thy wealth to
bury, but to distribute. Had God desired riches to be hoarded, He would not have given
them to men, but would have let them remain as they were in the earth; but because He
wishes them to be spent, therefore He has permitted us to have them, that we may impart
them to each other. And if we keep them to ourselves, we are no longer masters of them.
But if you wish to make them greater and therefore keep them shut up, even in this case the
best plan of all is to scatter and distribute them in all directions; because there can be no
revenue without an outlay, no wealth without expenditure. One may see that it is so even
in worldly matters. So it is with the merchant, so with the husbandman, who put forth the
one his wealth, the other his seed; the one sails the sea to disperse his wares, the other labors
all the year putting in and tending his seed. But here there is no need of any one of these
things, neither to equip a vessel, nor to yoke oxen, nor to plough land, nor to be anxious
about uncertain weather, nor to dread a fall of hail; here are neither waves nor rocks; this
voyage and this sowing needs one thing only, that we cast forth our possessions; all the rest
will that Husbandman do, of whom Christ saith, “My Father is the Husbandman.” ( c. xv.
1.) Is it not then absurd to be sluggish and slothful where we may gain all without labor,
and where there are many toils and many521 troubles and cares, and after all, an uncertain
hope, there to display all eagerness? Let us not, I beseech you, let us not be to such a degree
senseless about our own salvation, but let us leave the more troublesome task, and run to
that which is most easy and more profitable, that we may obtain also the good things that
are to come; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to
the Father and the Holy and quickening Spirit be glory, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p>John i. 43, 44</p>
<p>“The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philip, and saith unto him,
Follow Me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “To every careful thinker there is a gain”522 ( Prov. xiv. 23 , LXX.), saith the proverb;
and Christ implied more than this, when He said, “He that seeketh findeth.” ( Matt. vii. 8.)
Wherefore it does not occur to me any more to wonder how Philip followed Christ. Andrew
was persuaded when he had heard from John, and Peter the same from Andrew, but Philip
not having learned anything from any but Christ who said to him only this, “Follow Me,”
straightway obeyed, and went not back, but even became a preacher to others. For he ran
to Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and the
Prophets did write.” Seest thou what a thoughtful523 mind he had, how assiduously he
meditated on the writings of Moses, and expected the Advent? for the expression, “we have
found,” belongs always to those who are in some way seeking. “The day following Jesus
went forth into Galilee.” Before any had joined Him, He called no one; and He acted thus
not without cause, but according to his own wisdom and intelligence. For if, when no one
came to Him spontaneously, He had Himself drawn them, they might perhaps have started
away; but now, having chosen this of themselves, they afterwards remained firm. He calls
Philip, one who was better acquainted with Him; for he, as having been born and bred in
Galilee, knew Him more than others. Having then taken the disciples, He next goes to the
capture of the others, and draws to Him Philip and Nathanael. Now in the case of Nathanael
this was not so wonderful, because the fame of Jesus had gone forth into all Syria. ( Matt.
iv. 24 .) But the wonderful thing was respecting Peter and James and Philip, that they believed,
not only before the miracles, but that they did so being of Galilee, out of which “ariseth no
prophet,” nor “can any good thing come”; for the Galilæans were somehow of a more
boorish and dull disposition than others; but even in this Christ displayed forth His power,
by selecting from a land which bore no fruit His choicest disciples. It is then probable that
Philip having seen Peter and Andrew, and having heard what John had said, followed; and
it is probable also that the voice of Christ wrought in him somewhat; for He knew those
who would be serviceable. But all these points the Evangelist cuts short. That Christ should
come, he knew; that this was Christ, he knew not, and this I say that he heard either from
<note type="footnote">522 παντὶ τῷ μεριμνῶντι ἔνεστί περισσόν. In the next sentence Morel. Ben. and most mss. read ὅ θεν καὶ

Peter or John. But John mentions his village also, that you may learn that “God hath chosen
the weak things of the world.” ( 1 Cor. i. 27 .)</p>
<p>Ver. 45. “Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found Him of whom
Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”</p>
<p>He says this, to make his preaching credible, which it must be if it rests on Moses and
the Prophets besides, and by this to abash his hearer. For since Nathanael was an exact524
man, and one who viewed all things with truth, as Christ also testified and the event showed,
Philip with reason refers him to Moses and the Prophets, that so he might receive Him who
was preached. And he not troubled though he called Him “the son of Joseph”; for still he
was supposed to be his son. “And whence, O Philip, is it plain that this is He? What proof
dost thou mention to us? for it is not enough merely to assert this. What sign hast thou seen,
what miracle? Not without danger is it to believe without cause in such matters. What proof
then hast thou?” “The same as Andrew,” he replies; for he though unable to produce the
wealth which he had found, or to describe his treasure in words, when he had discovered
it, led his brother to it. So too did Philip. How this is the Christ, and how the prophets proclaimed
Him beforehand, he said not; but he draws him to Jesus, as knowing that he would
not afterwards fall off, if he should once taste His words and teaching.</p>
<p>Ver. 46, 47. “And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and
saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.”</p>
<p>He praises and approves the man, because he had said, “Can any good thing come out
of Nazareth?” and yet he ought to have been blamed. Surely not; for the words are not those
of an unbeliever, nor deserving blame, but praise. “How so, and in what way?” Because
Nathanael had considered the writings of the Prophets more than Philip. For he had heard
from the Scriptures, that Christ must come from Bethlehem, and from the village in which
David was. This belief at least prevailed among the Jews, and the Prophet had proclaimed
it of old, saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means the least among the princes of
Judah, for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall feed525 My people Israel.” ( Matt.
ii. 6; Mic. v. 2.) And so when he heard that He was “from Nazareth,” he was confounded,
and doubted, not finding the announcement of Philip to agree with the prediction of the
Prophet.</p>
<p>But observe his wisdom and candor even in his doubting. He did not at once say, “Philip,
thou deceivest me, and speakest falsely, I believe thee not, I will not come; I have learned
from the prophets that Christ must come from Bethlehem, thou sayest ‘from Nazareth’;
therefore this is not that Christ.” He said nothing like this; but what does he? He goes to
<note type="footnote">524 ἀ κριβὴς.</note>
<note type="footnote">525 or, “rule.”</note>

<pb n="144"/>
Him himself; showing, by not admitting that Christ was “of Nazareth,” his accuracy respecting
the Scriptures, and a character not easily deceived; and by not rejecting him who brought
the tidings, the great desire which he felt for the coming of Christ. For he thought within
himself that Philip was probably mistaken about the place.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And observe, I pray you, his manner of declining, how gentle he has made it, and
in the form of a question. For he said not, “Galilee produces no good”; but how said he?
“Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip also was very prudent; for he is not as
one perplexed, angry, and annoyed, but perseveres, wishing to bring over the526 man, and
manifesting to us from the first of his preaching527 the firmness528 which becomes an
Apostle. Wherefore also Christ saith, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.” So
that there is such a person as a false Israelite; but this is not such an one; for his judgment,
Christ saith, is impartial, he speaks nothing from favor, or from ill-feeling. Yet the Jews,
when they were asked where Christ should be born, replied, “In Bethlehem” ( Matt. ii. 5 ),
and produced the evidence, saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means the least among
the princes of Judah.” ( Mic. v. 2.) Before they had seen Him they bore this witness, but
when they saw Him in their malice they concealed the testimony, saying, “But as for this
fellow, we know not whence He is.” ( c. ix. 29.) Nathanael did not so, but continued to retain
the opinion which he had from the beginning, that He was not “of Nazareth.”</p>
<p>How then do the prophets call Him a Nazarene? From His being brought up and abiding
there. And He omits to say, “I am not ‘of Nazareth,’ as Philip hath told thee, but of Bethlehem,”
that He may not at once make the account seem questionable; and besides this, because,
even if He had gained belief, He would not have given sufficient proof that He was the Christ.
For what hindered Him without being Christ, from being of Bethlehem, like the others who
were born there? This then He omits; but He does that which has most power to bring him
over, for He shows that He was present when they were conversing. For when Nathanael
had said,</p>
<p>Ver. 48. “Whence knowest Thou me?” He replies, “Before that Philip called thee, when
thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.”</p>
<p>Observe a man firm and steady.529 When Christ had said, “Behold an Israelite indeed,
he was not made vain by this approbation, he ran not after this open praise, but continues
seeking and searching more exactly, and desires to learn something certain. He still enquired

as of a man,530 but Jesus answered as God. For He said, “I have known thee from the first,”531
(him and the candor532 of his character,533 this He knew not as a man, from having closely
followed him, but as God from the first,) “and but now I saw thee by the fig-tree”; when
there was no one present there but only Philip and Nathanael who said all these things in
private. It is mentioned, that having seen him afar off, He said, “Behold an Israelite indeed”;
to show,534 that before Philip came near, Christ spoke these words, that the testimony might
not be suspected. For this reason also He named the time, the place, and the tree; because
if He had only said, “Before Philip came to thee, I saw thee,” He might have been suspected
of having sent him, and of saying nothing wonderful; but now, by mentioning both the place
where he was when addressed by Philip, and the name of the tree, and the time of the conversation,
He showed that His foreknowledge535 was unquestionable.</p>
<p>And He did not merely show to him His foreknowledge, but instructed him also in another
way. For He brought him to a recollection of what they then had said; as, “Can there
any good thing come out of Nazareth?” And it was most especially on this account that
Nathanael received Him, because when he had uttered these words, He did not condemn,
but praised and approved him. Therefore he was assured that this was indeed the Christ,
both from His foreknowledge, and from His having exactly searched out his sentiments,
which was the act of One who would show that He knew what was in his mind; and besides,
from His not having blamed, but rather praised him when he had seemed to speak against
Himself. He said then, that Philip had “called” him; but what Philip had said to him or he
to Philip, He omitted, leaving it to his own conscience, and not desiring farther to rebuke
him.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Was it then only “before Philip called him” that He “saw” him? did He not see him
before this with His sleepless eye? He saw him, and none could gainsay it; but this is what
it was needful to say at the time. And what did Nathanael? When he had received an unquestionable
proof of His foreknowledge, he hastened to confess Him, showing by his previous
delay his caution,536 and his fairness by his assent afterwards. For, said the Evangelist,</p>
<p>Ver. 49. “He answered and saith unto Him, Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art
the King of Israel:”</p>

<p>Seest thou how his soul is filled at once with exceeding joy, and embraces Jesus with
words? “Thou art,” saith he, “that expected, that sought-for One.” Seest thou how he is
amazed, how he marvels? how he leaps and dances with delight?</p>
<p>So ought we also to rejoice, who have been thought worthy to know the Son of God; to
rejoice, not in thought alone, but to show it also by our actions. And what must they do who
rejoice? Obey Him who has been made known to them; and they who obey, must do whatever
He willeth. For if we are going to do what angers Him, how shall we show that we rejoice?
See ye not in our houses when a man entertains one whom he loves, how gladly he exerts
himself, running about in every direction, and though it be needful to spend all that he has,
sparing nothing so that he please his visitor? But if one who invites should not attend to his
guest,537 and not do such things as would procure him ease, though he should say ten
thousand times that he rejoices at his coming, he could never be believed by him. And justly;
for this should be shown by actions. Let us then, since Christ hath come to us, show that we
rejoice, and do nothing that may anger him; let us garnish the abode to which He has come,
for this they do who rejoice; let us set before Him the meal538 which He desires to eat, for
this they do who hold festival. And what is this meal? He saith Himself; “My meat is, that I
may do the will of Him that sent me.” ( c. iv. 34.) When He is hungry, let us feed Him; when
He is thirsty, let us give Him drink: though thou give Him but a cup of cold water, He receives
it; for He loves thee, and to one who loves, the offerings of the beloved, though they be small,
appear great. Only be not thou slothful; though thou cast in but two farthings, He refuses
them not, but receives them as great riches. For since He is without wants, and receives
these offerings, not because He needs them, it is reasonable that all distinction should be
not in the quantity of the gifts, but the intention539 of the giver. Only show that thou lovest
Him who is come, that for His sake thou art giving all diligence, that thou rejoicest at His
coming. See how He is disposed toward thee. He came for thee, He laid down His life for
thee, and after all this He doth not refuse even to entreat thee. “We are ambassadors,” saith
Paul, “for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” ( 2 Cor. v. 20.) “And who is so
mad,” saith some one, “as not to love his own Master?” I say so too, and I know that not
one of us would deny this in words or intention; but one who is beloved desires love to be
shown, not by words only, but by deeds also. For to say that we love, and not to act like
lovers, is ridiculous, not only before God, but even in the sight of men. Since then to confess
Him in word only, while in deeds we oppose Him, is not only unprofitable, but also hurtful
to us; let us, I entreat you, also make confession by our works; that we also may obtain a
confession from Him in that day, when before His Father He shall confess those who are

<head>Homily XXI.
John i. 49, 50</head>
<p>“Nathanael answered and saith unto Him, Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King
of Israel. Jesus answered, and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under
the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, we need much care, much watchfulness, to be able to look into the depth
of the Divine Scriptures. For it is not possible to discover their meaning in a careless way,
or while we are asleep, but there needs close search, and there needs earnest prayer, that we
may be enabled to see some little way into the secrets of the divine oracles. To-day, for instance,
here is no trifling question proposed to us, but one which requires much zeal and
enquiry. For when Nathanael said, “Thou art the Son of God,” Christ replies, “Because I
said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things
than these.”</p>
<p>Now what is the question arising from this passage? It is this.540 Peter, when after so
many miracles and such high doctrine he confessed that, “Thou art the Son of God” ( Matt.
xvi. 16 ), is called “blessed,” as having received the revelation from the Father; while Nathanael,
though he said the very same thing before seeing or hearing either miracles or doctrine,
had no such word addressed to him, but as though he had not said so much as he ought to
have said, is brought 541 to things greater still. What can be the reason of this? It is, that
Peter and Nathanael both spoke the same words, but not both with the same intention. Peter
confessed Him to be “The Son of God” but as being Very God; Nathanael, as being mere
man. And whence does this appear? From what he said after these words; for after, “Thou
art the Son of God,” he adds, “Thou art the King of Israel.” But the Son of God is not “King
of Israel” only, but of all the world.</p>
<p>And what I say is clear, not from this only, but also from what follows. For Christ added
nothing more to Peter, but as though his faith were perfect, said, that upon this confession
of his He would build the Church; but in the other case He did nothing like this, but the
contrary. For as though some large, and that the better, part were wanting to his confession
He added what follows. For what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 51. “Verily, verily I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the Angels
of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</p>
<note type="footnote">540 Morel. and ms. in Bodleian read the passage thus: πολλοὶ τῶν ἀναγινωσκόντων τὸ ῥητὸν τοῦτο
διαποροῦντες φάσι· τί δήποτε Πέτρος κ.τ.λ.</note>
<note type="footnote">541 al. “led forward.”</note>

<pb n="149"/>
<p>Seest thou how He leads him up by little and little from the earth, and causes him no
longer to imagine Him a man merely? for One to whom Angels minister, and on whom
Angels ascend and descend, how could He be man? For this reason He said, “Thou shalt
see greater things than these.” And in proof of this, He introduces the ministry of Angels.
And what He means is something of this kind: “Doth this, O Nathanael, seem to thee a great
matter, and hast thou for this confessed me to be King of Israel? What then wilt thou say,
when thou seest the Angels ascending and descending upon Me?” Persuading him by these
words to own Him Lord also of the Angels. For on Him as on the King’s own Son, the royal
ministers ascended and descended, once at the season of the Crucifixion, again at the time
of the Resurrection and the Ascension, and before this also, when they “came and ministered
unto Him” ( Matt. iv. 11 ), when they proclaimed the glad tidings of His birth, and cried,
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace” ( Luke ii. 14 ), when they came to Mary,
when they came to Joseph.</p>
<p>And He does now what He has done in many instances; He utters two predictions, gives
present proof of the one, and confirms that which has to be accomplished by that which is
so already. For of His sayings some had been proved, such as, “Before Philip called thee,
under the fig-tree I saw thee”; others had yet to come to pass, and had partly done so, namely,
the descending and ascending of the Angels, at the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the
Ascension; and this He renders credible by His words even before the event. For one who
had known His power by what had gone before, and heard from Him of things to come,
would more readily receive this prediction too.</p>
<p>What then does Nathanael? To this he makes no reply. And therefore at this point Christ
stopped His discourse with him, allowing him to consider in private what had been said;
and not choosing to pour forth all at once, having cast seed into fertile ground, He then
leaves it to shoot at leisure. And this He has shown in another place, where He saith, “The
kingdom of heaven is like to a man that soweth good seed, but while he slept, his enemy
cometh, and soweth tares among the wheat.”542</p>
<p>Chap. ii. ver. 1, 2. “On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And Jesus
was called to the marriage. And the mother of Jesus was there, and His brethren.”543</p>
<p>I said before that He was best known in Galilee; therefore they invite Him to the marriage,
and He comes; for He looked not to His own honor, but to our benefit. He who disdained
not to “take upon Him the form of a servant” ( Philip. ii. 7 ), would much less disdain to be
present at the marriage of servants; He who sat down “with publicans and sinners” ( Matt.
ix. 13 ), would much less refuse to sit down with those present at the marriage. Assuredly
they who invited Him had not formed a proper judgment of Him, nor did they invite Him
<note type="footnote">542 Matt. xiii. 24, 25 , slightly varying from G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">543 The reading is different in G. T.</note>

<pb n="150"/>
as some great one, but merely as an ordinary acquaintance; and this the Evangelist has hinted
at, when he says, “The mother of Jesus was there, and His brethren.” Just as they invited her
and His brethren, they invited Jesus.</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “And when they wanted wine, His mother saith unto Him, They have no wine.”</p>
<p>Here it is worth while to enquire whence it came into His mother’s mind to imagine
anything great of her Son; for He had as yet done no miracle, since the Evangelist saith,
“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.” ( c. ii. 11.)</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Now if any say that this is not a sufficient proof that it was the “beginning of His
miracles,” because there is added simply “in Cana of Galilee,” as allowing it to have been
the first done there, but not altogether and absolutely the first, for He probably might have
done others elsewhere, we will make answer to him of that which we have said before. And
of what kind? The words of John (the Baptist); “And I knew Him not; but that He should
be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come, baptizing with water.” Now if He had
wrought miracles in early age, the Israelites would not have needed another to declare Him.
For He who came among men, and by His miracles was so made known, not to those only
in Judæa, but also to those in Syria and beyond, and who did this in three years only, or
rather who did not need even these three years to manifest Himself ( Matt. iv. 24 ), for immediately
and from the first His fame went abroad everywhere; He, I say, who in a short
time so shone forth by the multitude of His miracles, that His name was well known to all,
was much less likely, if while a child He had from an early age wrought miracles, to escape
notice so long. For what was done would have seemed stranger as done by a boy, and there
would have been time for twice or thrice as many, and much more. But in fact He did
nothing while He was a child, save only that one thing to which Luke has testified ( Luke ii.
46 ), that at the age of twelve years He sat hearing the doctors, and was thought admirable
for His questioning. Besides, it was in accordance with likelihood and reason that He did
not begin His signs at once from an early age; for they would have deemed the thing a delusion.
For if when He was of full age many suspected this, much more, if while quite young
He had wrought miracles, would they have hurried Him sooner and before the proper time
to the Cross, in the venom of their malice; and the very facts of the Dispensation would have
been discredited.</p>
<p>“How then,” asks some one, “came it into the mind of His mother to imagine anything
great of Him?” He was now beginning to reveal Himself, and was plainly discovered by the
witness of John, and by what He had said to His disciples. And before all this, the Conception
itself and all its attending circumstances544 had inspired her with a very great opinion of
the Child; “for,” said Luke, “she heard all the sayings concerning the Child, and kept them
<note type="footnote">544 al. “and all that took place after His birth.”</note>

<pb n="151"/>
in her heart.”545 “Why then,” says one, “did not she speak this before?”546 Because, as I said,
it was now at last that He was beginning to manifest Himself. Before this time He lived as
one of the many, and therefore His mother had not confidence to say any such thing to
Him; but when she heard that John had come on His account, and that he had borne such
witness to Him as he did, and that He had disciples, after that she took confidence, and
called Him, and said, when they wanted wine, “They have no wine.” For she desired both
to do them a favor, and through her Son to render herself more conspicuous; perhaps too
she had some human feelings, like His brethren, when they said, “Show thyself to the world”
( c. xvii. 4 ), desiring to gain credit from His miracles. Therefore He answered somewhat
vehemently,547 saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.”</p>
<p>To prove that He greatly respected His mother, hear Luke relate how He was “subject
to” His parents ( Luke ii. 51 ), and our own Evangelist declare how He had forethought for
her at the very season of the Crucifixion. For where parents cause no impediment or
hindrance in things belonging to God, it is our bounden duty to give way to them, and there
is great danger in not doing so; but when they require anything unseasonably, and cause
hindrance in any spiritual matter, it is unsafe to obey. And therefore He answered thus in
this place, and again elsewhere, “Who is My mother, and who are My brethren?” ( Matt.
xii. 48 ), because they did not yet think rightly of Him; and she, because she had borne Him,
claimed, according to the custom of other mothers, to direct Him in all things, when she
ought to have reverenced and worshiped Him. This then was the reason why He answered
as He did on that occasion. For consider what a thing it was, that when all the people high
and low were standing round Him, when the multitude was intent on hearing548 Him, and
His doctrine had begun to be set forth, she should come into the midst and take Him away
from the work of exhortation, and converse with Him apart, and not even endure to come
within, but draw Him outside merely to herself. This is why He said, “Who is My mother
and My brethren?” Not to insult her who had borne Him, (away with the thought!) but to
procure her the greatest benefit, and not to let her think meanly of Him. For if He cared for
others, and used every means to implant in them a becoming opinion of Himself, much
more would He do so in the case of His mother. And since it was probable that if these
words had been addressed to her by her Son, she would not readily have chosen even then
<note type="footnote">545 This is the common reading, but the passage ( Luke ii. 51 ) is not so found in G. T.; Morel. and ms. in
Bodleian read: τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Λουκᾶς ἡμῖν δείκνυσι λέγων· ἡ δὲ Μαριὰμ συνετήρει τὰ ῥήματα πάντα συμβάλλουσα

<pb n="152"/>
to be convinced, but would in all cases have claimed the superiority as being His mother,
therefore He replied as He did to them who spake to Him; otherwise He could not have led
up her thoughts from His present lowliness to His future exaltation, had she expected that
she should always be honored by Him as by a son, and not that He should come as her
Master.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> It was then from this motive that He said in this place, “Woman, what have I to do
with thee?” and also for another reason not less pressing. What was that? It was, that His
miracles might not be suspected. The request ought to have come from those who needed,
not from His mother. And why so? Because what is done at the request of one’s friends,
great though it be, often causes offense to the spectators; but when they make the request
who have the need, the miracle is free from suspicion, the praise unmixed, the benefit great.
So if some excellent physician should enter a house where there were many sick, and be
spoken to by none of the patients or their relations, but be directed only by his own mother,
he would be suspected549 and disliked by the sufferers, nor would any of the patients or
their attendants deem him able to exhibit anything great or remarkable. And so this was a
reason why He rebuked her on that occasion, saying, “Woman, what have I to do with thee?”
instructing her for the future not to do the like; because, though He was careful to honor
His mother, yet He cared much more for the salvation of her soul, and for the doing good
to the many, for which He took upon Him the flesh.</p>
<p>These then were the words, not of one speaking rudely to his mother, but belonging to
a wise dispensation, which brought her into a right frame of mind, and provided that the
miracles should be attended with that honor which was meet. And setting other things aside,
this very appearance which these words have of having been spoken chidingly, is amply
enough to show that He held her in high honor, for by His displeasure He showed that He
reverenced her greatly; in what manner, we will say in the next discourse. Think of this then,
and when you hear a certain woman saying, “Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the
paps which Thou hast sucked,” and Him answering, “rather blessed are they that do the will
of my Father”550 ( Luke xi. 27 ), suppose that those other words also were said with the same
intention. For the answer was not that of one rejecting his mother, but of One who would
show that her having borne Him would have nothing availed her, had she not been very
good and faithful. Now if, setting aside the excellence of her soul, it profited Mary nothing
that the Christ was born of her, much less will it be able to avail us to have a father or a
brother, or a child of virtuous and noble disposition, if we ourselves be far removed from
his virtue. “A brother,” saith David, “doth not redeem, shall man redeem?” ( Ps. xlix. 7 ,
LXX.) We must place our hopes of salvation in nothing else, but only in our own righteous
<note type="footnote">549 [and tiresome] Morel.</note>

<pb n="153"/>
deeds (done) after551 the grace of God. For if this by itself could have availed,552 it would
have availed the Jews, (for Christ was their kinsman according to the flesh,) it would have
availed the town in which He was born, it would have availed His brethren. But as long as
His brethren cared not for themselves, the honor of their kindred availed them nothing, but
they were condemned with the rest of the world, and then only were approved, when they
shone by their own virtue; and the city fell, and was burnt, having gained nothing from this;
and His kinsmen according to the flesh were slaughtered and perished very miserably,
having gained nothing towards being saved from their relationship to Him, because they
had not the defense of virtue. The Apostles, on the contrary, appeared greater than any,
because they followed the true and excellent way of gaining relationship with Him, that by
obedience. And from this we learn that we have always need of faith, and a life shining and
bright, since this alone will have power to save us. For though His relations were for a long
time everywhere held in honor, being called the Lord’s kinsmen,553 yet now we do not even
know their names, while the lives and names of the Apostles are everywhere celebrated.</p>
<p>Let us then not be proud of nobleness of birth554 according to the flesh, but though we
have ten thousand famous ancestors, let us use diligence ourselves to go beyond their excellences,
knowing that we shall gain nothing from the diligence of others to help us in the
judgment that is to come; nay, this will be the more grievous condemnation, that though
born of righteous parents and having an example at home, we do not, even thus, imitate
our teachers. And this I say now, because I see many heathens, 555 when we lead them to
the faith and exhort them to become Christians, flying to their kinsmen and ancestors and
house, and saying, “All my relations and friends and companions are faithful Christians.”
What is that to thee, thou wretched and miserable? This very thing will be especially thy
ruin, that thou didst not respect the number of those around thee, and run to the truth.
Others again who are believers but live a careless life, when exhorted to virtue make the very
same defense, and say, “my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather were very
pious and good men.” But this will assuredly most condemn thee, that being descended
from such men, thou hast acted unworthily of the root from whence thou art sprung. For
hear what the Prophet says to the Jews, “Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept
(sheep)” ( Hos. xii. 12 ); and again Christ, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day,
and he saw it, and was glad.” ( c. viii. 56.) And everywhere they bring forward556 to them

the righteous acts of their fathers, not only to praise them, but also to make the charge
against their descendants more heavy. Knowing then this, let us use every means that we
may be saved by our own works, lest having deceived ourselves by vain trusting on others,
we learn that we have been deceived when the knowledge of it will profit us nothing. “In
the grave,” saith David, “who shall give thee thanks?” ( Ps. vi. 5.) Let us then repent here,
that we may obtain the everlasting goods, which may God grant we all do, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost
be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John ii. 4</p>
<p>“Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> In preaching the word there is some toil, and this Paul declares when he says, “Let
the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in
the word and doctrine.” ( 1 Tim. v. 17.) Yet it is in your power to make this labor light or
heavy; for if you reject our words, or if without actually rejecting them you do not show
them forth in your works, our toil will be heavy, because we labor uselessly and in vain:
while if ye heed them and give proof of it by your works, we shall not even feel the toil, because
the fruit produced by our labor will not suffer the greatness of that labor to appear.
So that if you would rouse our zeal, and not quench or weaken it, show us, I beseech you,
your fruit, that we may behold the fields waving557 with corn, and being supported by hopes
of an abundant crop, and reckoning up your558 riches, may not be slothful559 in carrying
on this good traffic.</p>
<p>It is no slight question which is proposed to us also to-day. For first, when the mother
of Jesus says, “They have no wine,” Christ replies, “Woman, what have I to do with thee?
Mine, hour is not yet come.” And then, having thus spoken, He did as His mother had said;
an action which needs enquiry no less than the words. Let us then, after calling upon Him
who wrought the miracle, proceed to the explanation.</p>
<p>The words are not used in this place only, but in others also; for the same Evangelist
says, “They could not lay hands on Him,560 because His hour was not yet come” ( c. viii. 20
); and again, “No man laid hands on Him, because His hour was not yet come” ( c. vii. 30
); and again, “The hour is come, glorify Thy Son.” ( c. xvii. 1.) What then do the words
mean? I have brought together more instances, that I may give one explanation of all. And
what is that explanation? Christ did not say, “Mine hour is not yet come,” as being subject
to the necessity of seasons, or the observance of an “hour”; how can He be so, who is Maker
of seasons, and Creator of the times and the ages? To what else then did He allude? He desires
to show561 this; that He works all things at their convenient season, not doing all at once;
because a kind of confusion and disorder would have ensued, if, instead of working all at

to Judgment. Observe this; creation was to be, yet not all at once; man and woman were to
be created, yet not even these together; mankind were to be condemned to death, and there
was to be a resurrection, yet the interval between the two was to be great; the law was to be
given, but not grace with it, each was to be dispensed at its proper time. Now Christ was
not subject to the necessity of seasons, but rather settled their order, since He is their Creator;
and therefore He saith in this place, “Mine hour is not yet come.” And His meaning is, that
as yet He was not manifest562 to the many, nor had He even His whole company of disciples;
Andrew followed Him, and next to563 him Philip, but no one else. And moreover, none of
these, not even His mother nor His brethren, knew Him as they ought; for after His many
miracles, the Evangelist says of His brethren, “For neither did His brethren believe in Him.”
( c. vii. 5.) And those at the wedding did not know Him either, for in their need they would
certainly have come to and entreated Him. Therefore He saith, “Mine hour is not yet come”;
that is, “I am not yet known to the company, nor are they even aware that the wine has
failed; let them first be sensible of this. I ought not to have been told it from thee; thou art
My mother, and renderest the miracle suspicious. They who wanted the wine should have
come and besought Me, not that I need this, but that they might with an entire assent accept
the miracle. For one who knows that he is in need, is very grateful when he obtains assistance;
but one who has not a sense of his need, will never have a plain and clear sense of the benefit.”</p>
<p>Why then after He had said, “Mine hour is not yet come,” and given her a denial, did
He what His mother desired? Chiefly it was, that they who opposed Him, and thought that
He was subject to the “hour,” might have sufficient proof that He was subject to no hour;
for had He been so, how could He, before the proper “hour” was come, have done what He
did? And in the next place, He did it to honor His mother, that He might not seem entirely
to contradict and shame her that bare Him in the presence of so many; and also, that He
might not be thought to want power,564 for she brought the servants to Him.</p>
<p>Besides, even while saying to the Canaanitish woman, “It is not meet to take the children’s
bread, and to give565 it unto dogs” ( Matt. xv. 26 ), He still gave the bread, as considering
her perseverance; and though after his first reply, He said, “I am not sent save unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel,” yet even after saying this, He healed the woman’s daughter.
Hence we learn, that although we be unworthy, we often by perseverance make ourselves
worthy to receive. And for this reason His mother remained by, and openly 566 brought to

Him the servants, that the request might be made by a greater number; and therefore she
added,</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.”</p>
<p>For she knew that His refusal proceeded not from want of power, but from humility,
and that He might not seem without cause567 to hurry to568 the miracle; and therefore she
brought the servants.569</p>
<p>Ver. 6, 7. “And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the
purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus said unto them, Fill the
waterpots with water; and they filled them up to the brim.”</p>
<p>It is not without a reason that the Evangelist says, “After the manner of the purifying
of the Jews,” but in order that none of the unbelievers might suspect that lees having been
left in the vessels, and water having been poured upon and mixed with them, a very weak
wine had been made. Therefore he says, “after the manner of the purifying of the Jews,” to
show that those vessels were never receptacles for wine. For because Palestine is a country
with but little water, and brooks and fountains were not everywhere to be found, they always
used to fill waterpots with water, so that they might not have to hasten to the rivers if at any
time they were defiled, but might have the means of purification at hand.</p>
<p>“And why was it, that He did not the miracle before they filled them, which would have
been more marvelous by far? for it is one thing to change given matter to a different quality,
and another to create matter out of nothing.” The latter would indeed have been more
wonderful, but would not have seemed so credible to the many. And therefore He often
purposely lessens570 the greatness of His miracles, that it may be the more readily received.</p>
<p>“But why,” says one, “did not He Himself produce the water which He afterwards showed
to be wine, instead of bidding the servants bring it?” For the very same reason; and also,
that He might have those who drew it out to witness that what had been effected was no
delusion since if any had been inclined to be shameless, those who ministered might have
said to them, “We drew the water, we filled the vessels.” And besides what we have mentioned,
He thus overthrows those doctrines which spring up against the Church. For since there
are some who say that the Creator of the world is another, and that the things which are
seen are not His works, but those of a certain other opposing god, to curb these men’s
madness He doth most of His miracles on matter found at hand.571 Because, had the creator
of these been opposed to Him, He would not have used what was another’s to set forth His

own power. But now to show that it is He who transmutes water in the vine plants, and who
converts the rain by its passage through the root into wine, He effected that in a moment
at the wedding which in the plant is long in doing. When they had filled the waterpots, He
said,</p>
<p>Ver. 8–10. “Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast; and they bare it.
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence
it was, (but the servants which drew the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the
bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and
when men have well drunk, then that which is worst; but thou hast kept the good wine until
now.”</p>
<p>Here again some mock,572 saying, “this was an assembly of drunken men, the sense of
the judges was spoilt, and not able to taste573 what was made, or to decide on what was
done, so that they did not know whether what was made was water or wine: for that they
were drunk,” it is alleged, “the ruler himself has shown by what he said.” Now this is most
ridiculous, yet even this suspicion the Evangelist has removed. For he does not say that the
guests gave their opinion on the matter, but “the ruler of the feast,” who was sober, and had
not as yet tasted anything. For of course you are aware, that those who are entrusted with
the management574 of such banquets are the most sober, as having this one business, to
dispose all things in order and regularity; and therefore the Lord called such a man’s sober
senses to testify to what was done. For He did not say, “Pour forth to them that sit at meat,”
but, “Bear unto the governor of the feast.”</p>
<p>“And when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew
not whence it was, (but the servants knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom.”
“And why did he not call the servants? for so the miracle would have been revealed.” Because
Jesus had not Himself revealed what had been done, but desired that the power of His miracles
should be known gently, little by little. And suppose that it had then been mentioned,
575 the servants who related it would never have been believed, but would have been thought
mad to bear such testimony to one who at that time seemed to the many a mere man; and
although they knew the certainty of the thing by experience, (for they were not likely to
disbelieve their own hands,) yet they were not sufficient to convince others. And so He did
not reveal it to all, but to him who was best able to understand what was done, reserving
the clearer knowledge of it for a future time; since after the manifestation of other miracles
this also would be credible. Thus when he was about to heal the nobleman’s son, the Evan-

<note type="footnote">574 διακονίαν.</note>
<note type="footnote">575 al. “examined.”</note>

<pb n="159"/>
gelist has shown that it had already become more clearly known; for it was chiefly because
the nobleman had become acquainted with the miracle that he called upon Him, as John
incidentally shows when he says, “Jesus came into Cana of Galilee, where He made the water
wine.” ( c. iv. 46.) And not wine simply, but the best.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> For such are the miraculous works of Christ, they are far more perfect and better
than the operations of nature. This is seen also in other instances; when He restored any
infirm member of the body, He made576 it better than the sound.</p>
<p>That it was wine then, and the best of wine, that had been made, not the servants only,
but the bridegroom and the ruler of the feast would testify; and that it was made by Christ,
those who drew the water; so that although the miracle were not then revealed, yet it could
not in the end be passed in silence, so many and constraining testimonies had He provided
for the future. That He had made the water wine, He had the servants for witnesses; that
the wine was good that had been made, the ruler of the feast and the bridegroom.</p>
<p>It might be expected that the bridegroom would reply to this, (the ruler’s speech,) and
say something, but the Evangelist, hastening to more pressing matters, has only touched
upon this miracle, and passed on. For what we needed to learn was, that Christ made the
water wine, and that good wine; but what the bridegroom said to the governor he did not
think it necessary to add. And many miracles, at first somewhat obscure, have in process of
time become more plain, when reported more exactly by those who knew them from the
beginning.</p>
<p>At that time, then, Jesus made of water wine, and both then and now He ceases not to
change our weak and unstable577 wills. For there are, yes, there are men who in nothing
differ from water, so cold, and weak, and unsettled. But let us bring those of such disposition
to the Lord, that He may change their will to the quality of wine, so that they be no longer
washy,578 but have body,579 and be the cause of gladness in themselves and others. But who
can these cold ones be? They are those who give their minds to the fleeting things of this
present life, who despise not this world’s luxury, who are lovers of glory and dominion: for
all these things are flowing waters, never stable, but ever rushing violently down the steep.
The rich to-day is poor tomorrow, he who one day appears with herald, and girdle, and
chariot, and numerous attendants, is often on the next the inhabitant of a dungeon, having
unwillingly quitted all that show to make room for another. Again, the gluttonous and dissipated580

<pb n="160"/>
day the supply582 conveyed by his delicacies, but when that is dispersed, in order to renew
it he is obliged to put in more, differing in nothing from a torrent. For as in the torrent when
the first body of water is gone, others in turn succeed; so in gluttony, when one repast is
removed, we again require another. And such is the nature and the lot of earthly things,
never to be stable, but to be always pouring and hurrying by; but in the case of luxury, it is
not merely the flowing and hastening by; but many other things that trouble us. By the violence
of its course it wears away583 the strength of the body, and strips the soul of its manliness,
and the strongest currents of rivers do not so easily eat away their banks and make
them sink down, as do luxury and wantonness sweep away all the bulwarks of our health;
and if you enter a physician’s house and ask him, you will find that almost all the causes of
diseases arise from this. For frugality and a plain584 table is the mother of health, and
therefore physicians585 have thus named it; for they have called the not being satisfied
“health,” (because not to be satisfied with food is health,) and they have spoken of sparing
diet as the “mother of health.” Now if the condition of want586 is the mother of health, it is
clear that fullness is the mother of sickness and debility, and produces attacks which are
beyond the skill even of physicians. For gout in the feet, apoplexy, dimness of sight, pains
in the hands, tremors, paralytic attacks, jaundice, lingering and inflammatory fevers, and
other diseases many more than these, (for we have not time to go over them all,) are the
natural offspring, not of abstinence and moderate587 diet, but of gluttony and repletion.
And if you will look to the diseases of the soul that arise from them, you will see that feelings
of coveting, sloth, melancholy, dullness, impurity, and folly of all kinds, have their origin
here. For after such banquets the souls of the luxurious become no better than asses, being
torn to pieces by such wild beasts as these (passions). Shall I say also how many pains and
displeasures they have who wait upon luxury? I could not enumerate them all, but by a
single principal point I will make the whole clear. At a table such as I speak of, that is, a
sumptuous one, men never eat with pleasure; for abstinence is the mother of pleasure as
well as health, while repletion is the source and root not only of diseases, but of displeasure.
For where there is satiety there desire cannot be, and where there is no desire, how can there
be pleasure? And therefore we should find that the poor are not only of better understanding
and healthier than the rich, but also that they enjoy a greater degree of pleasure. Let us, when
we reflect on this, flee drunkenness and luxury, not that of the table alone, but all other

<p>John ii. 11</p>
<p>“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Frequent and fierce is the devil in his attacks, on all sides besieging our salvation;
we therefore must watch and be sober, and everywhere fortify ourselves against his assault,
for if he but gain some slight vantage ground,588 he goes on to make for himself a broad
passage, and by degrees introduces all his forces. If then we have any care at all for our salvation,
let us not allow him to make his approaches even in trifles, that thus we may check
him beforehand in important matters; for it would be the extreme of folly, if, while he displays
such eagerness to destroy our souls, we should not bring even an equal amount in defense
of our own salvation.</p>
<p>I say not this without a cause, but because I fear lest that wolf be even now standing
unseen by us in the midst of the fold,589 and some sheep become a prey to him, being led
astray from the flock and from hearkening by its own carelessness and his craft. Were the
wounds590 sensible, or did the body receive the blows, there would be no difficulty in discerning
his plots; but since the soul is invisible, and since that it is which receives the wounds,
we need great watchfulness that each may prove himself; for none knoweth the things of a
man as the spirit of a man that is in him. ( 1 Cor. ii. 11.) The word is spoken indeed to all,
and is offered as a general remedy to those who need it, but it is the business of every individual
hearer to take what is suited to his complaint. I know not who are sick, I know not
who are well. And therefore I use every sort of argument, and introduce remedies suited to
all maladies,591 at one time condemning covetousness, after that touching on luxury, and
again on impurity, then composing something in praise of and exhortation to charity, and
each of the other virtues in their turn. For I fear lest when my arguments are employed on
any one subject, I may without knowing it be treating you for one disease while you are ill
of others. So that if this congregation were but one person, I should not have judged it so
absolutely necessary to make my discourse varied; but since in such a multitude there are
probably also many maladies, I not unreasonably diversify my teaching, since my discourse
will be sure to attain its object when it is made to embrace you all. For this cause also

dresses itself to the nature of mankind in common, and in such a multitude all the passions
of the soul must needs be; though all be not in each. Let us then cleanse ourselves of these,
and so listen to the divine oracles, and with contrite heart593 hear what has been this day
read to us.</p>
<p>And what is that? “This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.” I told you
the other day, that there are some who say that this is not the beginning. “For what,” says
one, “if ‘Cana of Galilee’ be added? This shows that this was ‘the beginning’ He made ‘in
Cana.’”594 But on these points I would not venture to assert anything exactly. I before have
shown that He began His miracles after His Baptism, and wrought no miracle before it; but
whether of the miracles done after His Baptism, this or some other was the first, it seems to
me unnecessary to assert positively.</p>
<p>“And manifested forth His glory.”</p>
<p>“How?” asks one, “and in what way? For only the servants, the ruler of the feast, and
the bridegroom, not the greater number of those present, gave heed to what was done.”
How then did he “manifest forth His glory”? He manifested it at least for His own part, and
if all present hear not of the miracle at the time, they would hear of it afterwards, for unto
the present time it is celebrated, and has not been unnoticed. That all did not know it on
the same day is clear from what follows, for after having said that He “manifested forth His
glory,” the Evangelist adds,</p>
<p>“And His disciples believed on Him.”</p>
<p>His disciples, who even before this regarded Him with wonder.595 Seest thou that it was
especially necessary to work the miracles at times when men were present of honest minds,
and who would carefully give heed to what was done? for these would more readily believe,
and attend more exactly to the circumstances. “And how could He have become known
without miracles?” Because His doctrine and prophetic powers were sufficient to cause
wonder in the souls of His hearers, so that they took heed to what He did with a right disposition,
their minds being already well affected towards Him. And therefore in many other
places the Evangelists say, that He did no miracle on account of the perversity of the men
who dwelt there. ( Matt. xii. 38; ch. xiii. 58 , U+0026c.)</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “After this He went down to Capernaum, He, and His mother, and His brethren,
and His disciples; and they continued there not many days.”</p>

<p>Wherefore comes He with “His mother to Capernaum”? for He hath done no miracle
there, and the inhabitants of that city were not of those who were rightminded towards Him,
but of the utterly corrupt. And this Christ declared when He said, “And thou, Capernaum,
which are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.” ( Luke x. 15.) Wherefore then
goes He? I think it was, because He intended a little after to go up to Jerusalem, that He then
went to Capernaum, to avoid leading about596 everywhere with Him, His mother and His
brethren. And so, having departed and tarried a little while to honor His mother, He again
commences His miracles after restoring to her home her who had borne Him. Therefore
the Evangelist says, After “not many days,”</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “He went up to Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>He received baptism then a few days before the passover. But on going up to Jerusalem,
what did He, a deed full of high authority; for He cast out of the Temple those dealers and
money changers, and those who sold doves, and oxen, and sheep, and who passed their time
there for this purpose.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Another Evangelist writes, that as He cast them out, He said, Make not my Father’s
house597 “a den of thieves,” but this one,</p>
<p>Ver. 16. (“Make not My Father’s house) an house of merchandise.”</p>
<p>They do not in this contradict each other, but show that he did this a second time, and
that both these expressions were not used on the same occasion, but that He acted thus once
at the beginning of His ministry, and again when He had come to the very time of His Passion.
Therefore, (on the latter occasion,) employing more strong expressions, He spoke of
it as598 (being made) “a den of thieves,” but here at the commencement of His miracles He
does not so, but uses a more gentle rebuke; from which it is probable that this took place599
a second time.</p>
<p>“And wherefore,” says one, “did Christ do this same, and use such severity against these
men, a thing which He is nowhere else seen to do, even when insulted and reviled, and called
by them ‘Samaritan’ and ‘demoniac’? for He was not even satisfied with words only, but
took a scourge, and so cast them out.” Yes, but it was when others were receiving benefit,
that the Jews accused and raged against Him; when it was probable that they would have
been made savage by His rebukes, they showed no such disposition towards Him, for they
neither accused nor reviled Him. What say they?</p>

<p>Seest thou their excessive malice, and how the benefits done to others incensed them
more (than reproofs)?</p>
<p>At one time then He said, that the Temple was made by them “a den of thieves,” showing
that what they sold was gotten by theft, and rapine, and covetousness, and that they were
rich through other men’s calamities; at another, “a house of merchandise,” pointing to their
shameless traffickings. “But wherefore did He this?” Since he was about to heal on the Sabbath
day, and to do many such things which were thought by them transgressions of the Law, in
order that He might not seem to do this as though He had come to be some rival God600
and opponent of His Father, He takes occasion hence to correct any such suspicion of theirs.
For One who had exhibited so much zeal for the House was not likely to oppose Him who
was Lord of the House, and who was worshiped in it. No doubt even the former years during
which He lived according to the Law, were sufficient to show His reverence for the Legislator,
and that He came not to give contrary laws; yet since it was likely that those years were forgotten
through lapse of time, as not having been known to all because He was brought up
in a poor and mean dwelling, He afterwards does this in the presence of all, (for many were
present because the feast was nigh at hand,) and at great risk. For he did not merely “cast
them out,” but also “overturned the tables,” and “poured out the money,” giving them by
this to understand, that He who threw Himself into danger for the good order of the House
could never despise his Master. Had He acted as He did from hypocrisy, He should only
have advised them; but to place Himself in danger was very daring. For it was no light thing
to offer Himself to the anger of so many market-folk,601 to excite against Himself a most
brutal mob of petty dealers by His reproaches and His blows, this was not the action of a
pretender, but of one choosing to suffer everything for the order of the House.</p>
<p>And therefore not by His actions only, but by His words, He shows his agreement with
the Father;602 for He saith not “the Holy House,” but “My Father’s House.” See, He even
calls Him, “Father,” and they are not wroth; they thought He spoke in a general way:603 but
when He went on and spoke more plainly, so as to set before them the idea of His Equality,
then they become angry.</p>
<p>And what say they? “What sign showest Thou unto us, seeing that Thou doest these
things?” Alas for their utter madness! Was there need of a sign before they could cease their
evil doings, and free the house of God from such dishonor? and was it not the greatest sign
of His Excellence that He had gotten such zeal for that House? In fact, the well-disposed604
were distinguished by this very thing, for “They,” His disciples, it says,</p>

<p>Ver. 17. “Remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.”</p>
<p>But the Jews did not remember the Prophecy, and said, “What sign showest Thou unto
us?” ( Ps. lxix. 9 ), both grieving that their shameful traffic was cut off, and expecting by
these means to stop Him, and also desiring to challenge Him to a miracle, and to find fault
with what He was doing. Wherefore He will not give them a sign; and before, when they
came and asked Him, He made them the same answer, “A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.”
( Matt. xvi. 4.) Only then the answer was clear, now it is more ambiguous. This He doth on
account of their extreme insensibility; for He who prevented605 them without their asking,
and gave them signs, would never when they asked have turned away from them, had He
not seen that their minds were wicked and false, and their intention treacherous.606 Think
how full of wickedness the question itself was at the outset. When they ought to have applauded
Him for His earnestness and zeal, when they ought to have been astonished that
He cared so greatly for the House, they reproach Him, saying, that it was lawful to traffic,
and unlawful for any to stop their traffic, except he should show them a sign. What saith
Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</p>
<p>Many such sayings He utters which were not intelligible to His immediate hearers, but
which were to be so to those that should come after. And wherefore doth He this? In order
that when the accomplishment of His prediction should have come to pass, He might be
seen to have foreknown from the beginning what was to follow; which indeed was the case
with this prophecy. For, saith the Evangelist,</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “When He was risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said
this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.”</p>
<p>But at the time when this was spoken, the Jews were perplexed as to what it might mean,
and cast about to discover, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “Forty and six years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in
three days?”</p>
<p>“Forty and six years,” they said, referring to the latter building, for the former was finished
in twenty years’ time. ( Ezra vi. 15.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Wherefore then did He not resolve the difficulty and say, “I speak not of that Temple,
but of My flesh”? Why does the Evangelist, writing the Gospel at a later period, interpret
the saying, and Jesus keep silence at the time? Why did He so keep silence? Because they
would not have received His word; for if not even the disciples were able to understand the
saying, much less were the multitudes. “When,” saith the Evangelist, “He was risen from
<note type="footnote">605 al. “took to Him.”</note>
<note type="footnote">606 ὕ πουλον.</note>

<pb n="167"/>
the dead, then they remembered, and believed the Scripture and His word.” There were two
things that hindered607 them for the time, one the fact of the Resurrection, the other, the
greater question whether He was God608 that dwelt within; of both which things He spake
darkly when He said, “Destroy this Temple, and I will rear it up in three days.” And this St.
Paul declares to be no small proof of His Godhead, when he writes, “Declared to be the Son
of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead.”
( Rom. i. 4.)</p>
<p>But why doth He both there, and here, and everywhere, give this for a sign, at one time
saying,609 “When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then ye shall know that I Am” ( c. viii.
28 ); at another, “There shall no sign be given you610 but the sign of the prophet Jonas” (
Matt. xii. 39 ); and again in this place, “In three days I will raise it up”? Because what especially
showed that He was not a mere man, was His being able to set up a trophy of victory over
death, and so quickly to abolish His long enduring tyranny, and conclude that difficult war.
Wherefore He saith, “Then ye shall know.” “Then.” When? When after My Resurrection I
shall draw (all) the world to Me, then ye shall know that I did these things as God, and Very
Son of God, avenging the insult offered to My Father.</p>
<p>“Why then, instead of saying, ‘What need is there of “signs” to check evil deeds?’ did
He promise that He would give them a sign?” Because by so doing He would have the more
exasperated them; but in this way He rather astonished them. Still they made no answer to
this, for He seemed to them to say what was incredible, so that they did not stay even to
question Him upon it, but passed it by as impossible. Yet had they been wise, though it
seemed to them at the time incredible, still when He wrought His many miracles they would
then have come and questioned Him, would then have intreated that the difficulty might
be resolved to them; but because they were foolish, they gave no heed at all to part of what
was said, and part they heard with evil frame of mind. And therefore Christ spoke to them
in an enigmatical way.</p>
<p>The question still remains, “How was it that the disciples did not know that He must
rise from the dead?” It was, because they had not been vouchsafed the gift of the Spirit; and
therefore, though they constantly heard His discourses concerning the Resurrection, they
understood them not, but reasoned with themselves what this might be. For very strange
and paradoxical was the assertion that one could raise himself, and would raise himself in
such wise. And so Peter was rebuked, when, knowing nothing about the Resurrection, he
said, “Be it far from Thee.” ( Matt. xvi. 22.) And Christ did not reveal it clearly to them before

the event, that they might not be offended at the very outset, being led to distrust His words
on account of the great improbability of the thing, and because they did not yet clearly know
Him, who He was. For no one could help believing what was proclaimed aloud by facts,
while some would probably disbelieve what was told to them in words. Therefore He at first
allowed the meaning of His words to be concealed; but when by their experience He had
verified His sayings, He after that gave them understanding of His words, and such gifts of
the Spirit that they received them all at once. “He,” saith Jesus, “shall bring all things to your
remembrance.” ( c. xiv. 26.) For they who in a single night cast off all respect for Him, and
fled from and denied that they even knew Him, would scarcely have remembered what He
had done and said during the whole time, unless they had enjoyed much grace of the Spirit.</p>
<p>“But,” says one, “if they were to hear from the Spirit, why needed they to accompany
Christ when they would not retain His words?” Be cause the Spirit taught them not, but
called to their mind what Christ had said before; and it contributes not a little to the glory
of Christ, that they were referred to the remembrance of the words He had spoken to them.
At the first then it was of the gift of God that the grace of the Spirit lighted upon them so
largely and abundantly; but after that, it was of their own virtue that they retained the Gift.
For they displayed a shining life, and much wisdom, and great labors, and despised this
present life, and thought nothing of earthly things, but were above them all; and like a sort
of light-winged eagle, soaring high by their works; reached611 to heaven itself, and by these
possessed the unspeakable grace of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let us then imitate them, and not quench our lamps, but keep them bright by almsdoing,
for so is the light of this fire preserved. Let us collect the oil into our vessels whilst
we are here, for we cannot buy it when we have departed to that other place, nor can we
procure it elsewhere, save only at the hands of the poor. Let us therefore collect it thence
very abundantly, if, at least, we desire to enter in with the Bridegroom. But if we do not this,
we must remain without the bridechamber, for it is impossible, it is impossible, though we
perform ten thousand other good deeds, to enter the portals of the Kingdom without almsdoing.
Let us then show forth this very abundantly, that we may enjoy those ineffable
blessings; which may it come to pass that we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXIV.</head>
<p>John ii. 23</p>
<p>“Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the feast, many believed on Him.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Of the men of that time some clung to their error, others laid hold on the truth,
while of these last, some having retained it for a little while again fell off from it. Alluding
to these, Christ compared them to seeds not deeply sown, but having their roots upon the
surface of the earth; and He said that they should quickly perish. And these the Evangelist
has here pointed out to us, saying,</p>
<p>“When He was in Jerusalem, at the Passover, in the feast, many believed on Him,612
when they saw the miracles which He did.”</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.”</p>
<p>For they were the more perfect613 among His disciples, who came to Him not only because
of His miracles, but through His teaching also. The grosser sort the miracles attracted,
but the better reasoners His prophecies and doctrines; and so they who were taken by His
teaching were more steadfast than those attracted by His miracles. And Christ also called
them “blessed,” saying, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” ( c. xx.
29 .) But that these here mentioned were not real disciples, the following passage shows, for
it saith, “Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.” Wherefore?</p>
<p>“Because He knew all things,”614</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “And needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.”</p>
<p>The meaning is of this kind. “He who dwells in men’s hearts, and enters into their
thoughts, took no heed of outward words; and knowing well that their warmth was but for
a season, He placed not confidence in them as in perfect disciples, nor committed all His
doctrines to them as though they had already become firm believers.” Now, to know what
is in the heart of men belongs to God alone, “who hath fashioned hearts one by one” ( Ps.
xxxiii. 15 , LXX.), for, saith Solomon, “Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts” ( 1 Kings
viii. 39 ); He therefore needed not witnesses to learn the thoughts of His own creatures, and
so He felt no confidence in them because of their mere, temporary belief. Men, who know
neither the present nor the future, often tell and entrust all without any reserve to persons
who approach them deceitfully and who shortly will fall off from them; but Christ did not
so, for well He knew all their secret thoughts.</p>

<pb n="170"/>
<p>And many such now there are, who have indeed the name of faith, but are unstable,615
and easily led away; wherefore neither now doth Christ commit Himself to them, but concealeth
from them many things; and just as we do not place confidence in mere acquaintances
but in real friends, so also doth Christ. Hear what He saith to His disciples, “Henceforth I
call you not servants, ye are My friends.” ( c. xv. 14, 15.) Whence is this and why? “Because
all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you.” And therefore He
gave no signs to the Jews who asked for them, because they asked tempting Him. Indeed
the asking for signs is a practice of tempters both then and now; for even now there are
some that seek them and say, “Why do not miracles take place also at this present time?” If
thou art faithful, as thou oughtest to be, and lovest Christ as thou oughtest to love Him,
thou hast no need of signs, they are given to the unbelievers. “How then,” asks one, “were
they not given to the Jews?” Given they certainly were; and if there were times when though
they asked they did not receive them, it was because they asked them not that they might
be delivered from their unbelief, but in order the more to confirm their wickedness.</p>
<p>Chap. iii. 1, 2. “And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus. The same
came to Jesus by night.”</p>
<p>This man appears also in the middle of the Gospel, making defense for Christ; for he
saith, “Our law judgeth no man616 before it hear him” ( c. vii. 51 ); and the Jews in anger
replied to him, “Search and look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” Again after the
crucifixion he bestowed great care upon the burial of the Lord’s body: “There came also,”
saith the Evangelist, “Nicodemus, which came to the Lord617 by night, and brought a mixture
of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.” ( c. xix. 39.) And even now he was
disposed towards Christ,618 but not as he ought, nor with proper sentiments respecting
Him, for he was as yet entangled in Jewish infirmity. Wherefore he came by night, because
he feared to do so by day. Yet not for this did the merciful God reject or rebuke him, or deprive
him of His instruction, but even with much kindness conversed with him and disclosed
to him very exalted doctrines, enigmatically indeed, but nevertheless He disclosed them.
For far more deserving of pardon was he than those who acted thus through wickedness.
They are entirely without excuse; but he, though he was liable to condemnation, yet was
not so to an equal degree. “How then does the Evangelist say nothing of the kind concerning
him?” He has said in another place, that “of the rulers also many believed on Him, but because
of the Jews619 they did not confess (Him), lest they should be put out of the synagogue” (

c. xii. 42 ); but here he has implied the whole by mentioning his coming “by night.” What
then saith Nicodemus?</p>
<p>“Rabbi, we know that Thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do the miracles
that Thou doest, except God be with him.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Nicodemus yet lingers620 below, has yet human thoughts concerning Him, and
speaks of Him as of a Prophet, imagining nothing great from His miracles. “We know,” he
says, “that Thou art a Teacher come from God.” “Why then comest thou by night and
secretly, to Him that speaketh the things of God, to Him who cometh from God? Why
conversest thou not with Him openly?” But Jesus said nothing like this to him, nor did He
rebuke him; for, saith the Prophet, “A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax
shall he not quench; He shall not strive nor cry” ( Isa. xlii. 2, 3; as quoted Matt. xii. 19, 20 ):
and again He saith Himself, “I came not to condemn the world, but to save the world.” ( c.
xii. 47.)</p>
<p>“No man can do these miracles, except God be with him.”</p>
<p>Still here Nicodemus speaks like the heretics, in saying, that He hath a power working
within Him,621 and hath need of the aid of others to do as He did. What then saith Christ?
Observe His exceeding condescension. He refrained for a while from saying, “I need not
the help of others, but do all things with power, for I am the Very Son of God, and have the
same power as My Father,” because this would have been too hard for His hearer; for I say
now what I am always saying, that what Christ desired was, not so much for a while to reveal
His own Dignity, as to persuade men that He did nothing contrary to His Father. And
therefore in many places he appears in words confined by limits,622 but in His actions He
doth not so. For when He worketh a miracle, He doth all with power, saying, “I will, be thou
clean.” ( Matt. viii. 3.) “Talitha, arise.” ( Mark v. 41 ; not verbally quoted.) “Stretch forth thy
hand.” ( Mark iii. 5.) “Thy sins be forgiven thee.” ( Matt. ix. 2.) “Peace, be still.” ( Mark iv.
39.) “Take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.” ( Matt. ix. 6.) “Thou foul spirit, I say unto
thee, come out of him.” ( Mark ix. 25 ; not verbally quoted.) “Be it unto thee even as thou
wilt.” ( Matt. xv. 28.) “If any one say (aught) unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of
him.” ( Mark xi. 3.) “This day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.” ( Luke xxiii. 43 .) “Ye have
heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; but I say unto you, that
whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment.” (
Matt. v. 21, 22.) “Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” ( Mark i. 17.) And

<pb n="172"/>
everywhere we observe that His authority is great; for in His actions no one could find fault
with what was done. How was it possible? Had His words not come to pass, nor been accomplished
as He commanded, any one might have said that they were the commands of a
madman; but since they did come to pass, the reality of their accomplishment stopped men’s
mouths even against their will. But with regard to His discourses, they might often in their
insolence charge Him with madness. Wherefore now in the case of Nicodemus, He utters
nothing openly, but by dark sayings leads him up from his low thoughts, teaching him, that
He has sufficient power in Himself to show forth miracles; for that His Father begat Him
Perfect and All-sufficient, and without any imperfection.</p>
<p>But let us see how He effects this. Nicodemus saith, “Rabbi, we know that Thou art a
Teacher come from God, for no man can do the miracles that Thou doest, except God be
with him.” He thought he had said something great when he had spoken thus of Christ.
What then saith Christ? To show that he had not yet set foot even on the threshold of right
knowledge, nor stood in the porch, but was yet wandering somewhere without the palace,
both he and whoever else should say the like, and that he had not so much as glanced towards
true knowledge when he held such an opinion of the Only-Begotten, what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>That is, “Unless thou art born again and receivest the right doctrines, thou art wandering
somewhere without, and art far from the Kingdom of heaven.” But He does not speak so
plainly as this. In order to make the saying less hard to bear, He does not plainly direct it at
him, but speaks indefinitely, “Except a man be born again”: all but saying, “both thou and
any other, who may have such opinions concerning Me, art somewhere without the Kingdom.”
Had He not spoken from a desire to establish this, His answer would have been
suitable to what had been said. Now the Jews, if these words had been addressed to them,
would have derided Him and departed; but Nicodemus shows here also his desire of instruction.
623 And this is why in many places Christ speaks obscurely, because He wishes to rouse
His hearers to ask questions, and to render them more attentive. For that which is said
plainly often escapes the hearer, but what is obscure renders him more active and zealous.
Now what He saith, is something like this: “If thou art not born again, if thou partakest not
of the Spirit which is by the washing624 of Regeneration, thou canst not have a right opinion
of Me, for the opinion which thou hast is not spiritual, but carnal.”625 ( Tit. iii. 5.) But He
did not speak thus, as refusing to confound626 one who had brought such as he had, and
<note type="footnote">623 al. “of truth.”</note>
<note type="footnote">624 or, “laver.”</note>
<note type="footnote">625 ψυχικὴ, “belonging to the natural life,” opposed in N.T. to πνευματική.</note>
<note type="footnote">626 or, “strike.”</note>

<pb n="173"/>
who had spoken to the best of his ability; and He leads him unsuspectedly up to greater
knowledge, saying, “Except a man be born again.” The word “again,”627 in this place, some
understand to mean “from heaven,” others, “from the beginning.” “It is impossible,” saith
Christ, “for one not so born to see the Kingdom of God”; in this pointing to Himself, and
declaring that there is another beside the natural sight, and that we have need of other eyes
to behold Christ. Having heard this,</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “Nicodemus saith, How can a man be born when he is old?”</p>
<p>Callest thou Him “Master,” sayest thou that He is “come from God,” and yet receivest
thou not His words, but usest to thy Teacher a manner of speaking which expresses628 much
perplexity? For the “How,” is the doubting question of those who have no strong belief, but
who are yet of the earth. Therefore Sarah laughed when she had said, “How?” And many
others having asked this question, have fallen from the faith.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And thus heretics continue in their heresy, because they frequently make this enquiry,
saying, some of them, “How was He begotten?” others, “How was He made flesh?” and
subjecting that Infinite Essence to the weakness of their own reasonings.629 Knowing which,
we ought to avoid this unseasonable curiosity, for they who search into these matters shall,
without learning the “How,” fall away from the right faith. On this account Nicodemus,
being in doubt, enquires the manner in which this can be, (for he understood that the words
spoken referred to himself,) is confused, and dizzy,630 and in perplexity, having come as to
a man, and hearing more than man’s words, and such as no one ever yet had heard; and for
a while he rouses himself at the sublimity of the sayings, but yet is in darkness, and unstable,
borne about in every direction, and continually falling away from the faith. And therefore
he perseveres in proving the impossibility, so as to provoke Him to clearer teaching.</p>
<p>“Can a man,” he saith, “enter into his mother’s womb, and be born?”</p>
<p>Seest thou how when one commits spiritual things to his own reasonings, he speaks ridiculously,
seems to be trifling, or to be drunken, when he pries into what has been said
beyond what seems good to God, and admits not the submission of faith? Nicodemus heard
of the spiritual Birth, yet perceived it not as spiritual, but dragged down the words to the
lowness of the flesh, and made a doctrine so great and high depend upon physical consequence.
And so he invents frivolities, and ridiculous difficulties. Wherefore Paul said,
“The natural631 man receiveth not the things of the Spirit.” ( 1 Cor. ii. 14.) Yet even in this
he preserved his reverence for Christ, for he did not mock at what had been said, but,
<note type="footnote">627 ἄ νωθεν (“again,” or “from above”).</note>

<pb n="174"/>
deeming it impossible, held his peace. There were two difficulties; a Birth of this kind, and
the Kingdom; for neither had the name of the Kingdom ever been heard among the Jews,
nor of a Birth like this. But he stops for a while at the first, which most astonished 632 his
mind.</p>
<p>Let us then, knowing this, not enquire into things relating to God by reasoning, nor
bring heavenly matters under the rule of earthly consequences, nor subject them to the necessity
of nature; but let us think of all reverently, believing as the Scriptures have said; for
the busy and curious person gains nothing, and besides not finding what he seeks, shall
suffer extreme punishment. Thou hast heard, that (the Father) begat (the Son): believe what
thou hast heard; but do ask not, “How,” and so take away the Generation; to do so would
be extreme folly. For if this man, because, on hearing of a Generation, not that ineffable
Generation, but this which is by grace, he conceived nothing great concerning it, but human
and earthly thoughts, was therefore darkened and in doubt, what punishment must they
deserve, who are busy and curious about that most awful Generation, which transcends all
reason and intellect? For nothing causes such dizziness633 as human reasoning, all whose
words are of earth, and which cannot endure to be enlightened from above. Earthly reasonings
are full of mud, and therefore need we streams from heaven, that when the mud has
settled, the clearer portion may rise and mingle with the heavenly lessons; and this comes
to pass, when we present an honest soul and an upright life. For certainly it is possible for
the intellect to be darkened, not only by unseasonable curiosity, but also by corrupt manners;
wherefore Paul hath said to the Corinthians, “I have fed you with milk, and not with meat;
for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able, for ye are yet carnal; for
whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal?” ( 1 Cor.
iii. 2.) And also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in many places, one may see Paul asserting
that this is the cause of evil doctrines; for that the soul possessed by passions634 cannot behold
anything great or noble, but as if darkened by a sort of film635 suffers most grievous dimsightedness.</p>
<p>Let us then cleanse ourselves, let us kindle the light of knowledge, let us not sow among
thorns. What the thorns are, ye know, though we tell you not; for often ye have heard Christ
call the cares of this present life, and the deceitfulness of riches, by this name. ( Matt. xiii.
22.) And with reason. For as thorns are unfruitful, so are these things; as thorns tear those
that handle them, so do these passions; as thorns are readily caught by the fire, and hateful
by the husbandman, so too are the things of the world; as in thorns, wild beasts, and snakes,

and scorpions hide themselves, so do they in the deceitfulness of riches. But let us kindle
the fire of the Spirit, that we may consume the thorns, and drive away the beasts, and make
the field clear for the husbandman; and after cleansing it, let us water it with the streams of
the Spirit, let us plant the fruitful olive, that most kindly of trees, the evergreen, the lightgiving,
the nutritious, the wholesome. All these qualities hath almsgiving, which is, as it
were, a seal on636 those that possess it. This plant not even death when it comes causes to
wither, but ever it stands enlightening the mind, feeding the sinews637 of the soul, and rendering
its strength mightier. And if we constantly possess it, we shall be able with confidence
to behold the Bridegroom, and to enter into the bridal chamber; to which may we all attain,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“Verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Little children who go daily to their teachers receive their lessons, and repeat638
them, and never cease from this kind of acquisition, but sometimes employ nights as well
as days, and this they are compelled639 to do for perishable and transient things. Now we
do not ask of you who are come to age such toil as you require of your children; for not
every day, but two days only in the week do we exhort you to hearken to our words, and
only for a short portion of the day, that your task may be an easy one. For the same reason
also we divide640 to you in small portions what is written in Scripture, that you may be able
easily to receive and lay them up in the storehouses of your minds, and take such pains to
remember them all, as to be able exactly to repeat them to others yourselves, unless any one
be sleepy, and dull, and more idle than a little child.</p>
<p>Let us now attend to the sequel of what has been before said. When Nicodemus fell into
error and wrested the words of Christ to the earthly birth, and said that it was not possible
for an old man to be born again, observe how Christ in answer more clearly reveals the
manner of the Birth, which even thus had difficulty for the carnal enquirer, yet still was able
to raise the hearer from his low opinion of it. What saith He? “Verily I say unto thee, Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” What
He declares is this: “Thou sayest that it is impossible, I say that it is so absolutely possible
as to be necessary, and that it is not even possible otherwise to be saved.” For necessary
things God hath made exceedingly easy also. The earthly birth which is according to the
flesh, is of the dust, and therefore heaven641 is walled against it, for what hath earth in
common with heaven? But that other, which is of the Spirit, easily unfolds to us the arches642
above. Hear, ye as many as are unilluminated,643 shudder, groan, fearful is the threat, fearful
the sentence.644 “It is not (possible),” He saith, “for one not born of water and the Spirit, to
enter into the Kingdom of heaven”; because he wears the raiment of death, of cursing, of

perdition, he hath not yet received his Lord’s token,645 he is a stranger and an alien, he hath

<p>Yet even thus Nicodemus did not understand. Nothing is worse than to commit spiritual
things to argument; it was this that would not suffer him to suppose anything sublime and
great. This is why we are called faithful, that having left the weakness of human reasonings
below,646 we may ascend to the height of faith, and commit most of our blessings to her647
teaching;648 and if Nicodemus had done this, the thing would not have been thought by
him impossible. What then doth Christ? To lead him away from his groveling imagination,
and to show that He speaks not of the earthly birth, He saith, “Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven.” This He spoke, willing
to draw him to the faith by the terror of the threat, and to persuade him not to deem the
thing impossible, and taking pains to move him from his imagination as to the carnal birth.
“I mean,” saith He, “another Birth, O Nicodemus. Why drawest thou down the saying to
earth? Why subjectest thou the matter to the necessity of nature? This Birth is too high for
such pangs as these; it hath nothing in common with you; it is indeed called ‘birth,’ but in
name only has it aught in common, in reality it is different. Remove thyself from that which
is common and familiar; a different kind of childbirth bring I into the world; in another
manner will I have men to be generated: I have come to bring a new manner of Creation. I
formed (man) of earth and water; but that which was formed was unprofitable, the vessel
was wrenched awry;649 I will no more form them of earth and water, but ‘of water’ and ‘of
the Spirit.’”</p>
<p>And if any one asks, “How of water?” I also will ask, How of earth? How was the clay
separated into different parts? How was the material uniform, (it was earth only,) and the
things made from it, various and of every kind? Whence are the bones, and sinews, and ar-
teries, and veins? Whence the membranes, and vessels of the organs, the cartilages, the tissues,
the liver, spleen, and heart? whence the skin, and blood, and mucus, and bile? whence
so great powers, whence such varied colors? These belong not to earth or clay. How does
the earth, when it receives the seeds, cause them to shoot, while the flesh receiving them
wastes them? How does the earth nourish what is put into it, while the flesh is nourished
by these things, and does not nourish them? The earth, for instance, receives water, and
makes it wine; the flesh often receives wine, and changes it into water. Whence then is it

clear that these things are formed of earth, when the nature of the earth is, according to
what has been said,650 contrary to that of the body? I cannot discover by reasoning, I accept
it by faith only. If then things which take place daily, and which we handle, require faith,
much more do those which are more mysterious and more spiritual than these. For as the
earth, which is soulless and motionless, was empowered by the will of God, and such wonders
were worked in it; much more when the Spirit is present with the water, do all those things
so strange and transcending reason, easily take place.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Do not then disbelieve these things, because thou seest them not; thou dost not see
thy soul, and yet thou believest that thou hast a soul, and that it is a something different
besides651 the body.</p>
<p>But Christ led him not in by this example, but by another; the instance of the soul,
though it is incorporeal, He did not adduce for that reason, because His hearer’s disposition
was as yet too dull. He sets before him another, which has no connection with the density
of solid bodies, yet does not reach so high as to the incorporeal natures; that is, the movement
of wind. He begins at first with water, which is lighter than earth, but denser than air. And
as in the beginning earth was the subject material,652 but the whole653 was of Him who
molded it; so also now water is the subject material, and the whole654 is of the grace of the
Spirit: then, “man became a living soul,” ( Gen. ii. 7 ); now he becomes “a quickening Spirit.”
But great is the difference between the two. Soul affords not life to any other than him in
whom it is; Spirit not only lives, but affords life to others also. Thus, for instance, the Apostles
even raised the dead. Then, man was formed last, when the creation had been accomplished;
now, on the contrary, the new man is formed before the new creation; he is born first, and
then the world is fashioned anew. ( 1 Cor. xv. 45.) And as in the beginning He formed him
entire, so He creates him entire now. Then He said, “Let us make for him a help” ( Gen. ii.
18 , LXX.), but here He said nothing of the kind. What other help shall he need, who has
received the gift of the Spirit? What further need of assistance has he, who belongs to 655
the Body of Christ? Then He made man in the image of God, now He hath united656 him
with God Himself; then He bade him rule over the fishes and beasts, now He hath exalted
our first-fruits above the heavens; then He gave him a garden for his abode,657 now He hath

opened heaven to us; then man was formed on the sixth day, when the world658 was almost
finished; but now on the first, at the very beginning, at the time when light was made before.
From all which it is plain, that the things accomplished belonged to659 another and a better
life, and to a condition660 having no end.</p>
<p>The first creation then, that of Adam, was from earth; the next, that of the woman, from
his rib; the next, that of Abel, from seed; yet we cannot arrive at the comprehension of661
any one of these, nor prove the circumstances by argument, though they are of a most earthly
nature;662 how then shall we be able to give account of the unseen663 generation664 by
Baptism, which is far more exalted than these, or to require arguments665 for that strange
and marvelous Birth?666 Since even Angels stand by while that Generation takes place, but
they could not tell the manner of that marvelous working, they stand by only, not performing
anything, but beholding what takes place. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, worketh
all. Let us then believe the declaration of God; that is more trustworthy than actual seeing.
The sight often is in error, it is impossible that God’s Word should fail; let us then believe
it; that which called the things that were not into existence may well be trusted when it
speaks of their nature. What then says it? That what is effected is a Generation. If any ask,
“How,” stop his mouth with the declaration of God,667 which is the strongest and a plain
proof. If any enquire, “Why is water included?” let us also in return ask, “Wherefore was
earth employed at the beginning in the creation of man?” for that it was possible for God
to make man without earth, is quite plain to every one. Be not then over-curious.</p>
<p>That the need of water is absolute and indispensable,668 you may learn in this way. On
one occasion, when the Spirit had flown down before the water was applied, the Apostle
did not stay at this point, but, as though the water were necessary and not superfluous, ob-

serve what he says; “Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which
have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?” ( Acts x. 47.)</p>
<p>What then is the use of the water? This too I will tell you hereafter, when I reveal to you
the hidden mystery.669 There are also other points of mystical teaching connected with the
matter, but for the present I will mention to you one out of many. What is this one? In
Baptism are fulfilled the pledges of our covenant with God;670 burial and death, resurrection
and life; and these take place all at once. For when we immerse our heads in the water, the
old man is buried as in a tomb below, and wholly sunk forever;671 then as we raise them
again, the new man rises in its stead.672 As it is easy for us to dip and to lift our heads again,
so it is easy for God to bury the old man, and to show forth the new. And this is done thrice,
that you may learn that the power of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost fulfilleth all
this. To show that what we say is no conjecture, hear Paul saying, “We are buried with Him
by Baptism into death”: and again, “Our old man is crucified with Him”: and again, “We
have been planted together in the likeness of His death.” ( Rom. vi. 4, 5, 6.) And not only is
Baptism called a “cross,” but the “cross” is called “Baptism.” “With the Baptism,” saith
Christ, “that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized” ( Mark x. 39 ): and, “I have a Baptism
to be baptized with” ( Luke xii. 50 ) (which ye know not); for as we easily dip and lift our
heads again, so He also easily died and rose again when He willed or rather much more
easily, though He tarried the three days for the dispensation of a certain mystery.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then who have been deemed worthy of such mysteries show forth a life worthy
of the Gift, that is, a most excellent conversation;673 and do ye who have not yet been deemed
worthy, do all things that you may be so, that we may be one body, that we may be brethren.
For as long as we are divided in this respect, though a man be father, or son, or brother, or
aught else, he is no true kinsman, as being cut off from that relationship which is from above.
What advantageth it to be bound by the ties of earthly family, if we are not joined by those
of the spiritual? what profits nearness of kin on earth, if we are to be strangers in heaven?
For the Catechumen is a stranger to the Faithful. He hath not the same Head, he hath not
the same Father, he hath not the same City, nor Food, nor Raiment, nor Table, nor House,
but all are different; all are on earth to the former, to the latter all are in heaven. One has
Christ for his King; the other, sin and the devil; the food674 of one is Christ, of the other,

that meat which decays and perishes; one has worms’ work for his raiment, the other the
Lord of angels; heaven is the city of one, earth of the other. Since then we have nothing in
common, in what, tell me, shall we hold communion? Did we remove the same pangs,675
did we come forth from the same womb? This has nothing to do with that most perfect relationship.
Let us then give diligence that we may become citizens of the city which is above.
How long do we tarry over the border,676 when we ought to reclaim our ancient country?
We risk no common danger; for if it should come to pass, (which God forbid!) that through
the sudden arrival of death we depart hence uninitiated,677 though we have ten thousand
virtues, our portion will be no other than hell, and the venomous worm, and fire unquenchable,
and bonds indissoluble. But God grant that none of those who hear these words experience
that punishment! And this will be, if having been deemed worthy of the sacred mysteries,
we build upon that foundation gold, and silver, and precious stones; for so after our
departure hence we shall be able to appear in that place rich, when we leave not our riches
here, but transport them to inviolable treasuries by the hands of the poor, when we lend to
Christ. Many are our debts there, not of money, but of sins; let us then lend Him our riches,
that we may receive pardon for our sins; for He it is that judgeth. Let us not neglect Him
here when He hungereth, that He may ever feed us there. Here let us clothe Him, that He
leave us not bare of the safety which is from Him. If here we give Him drink, we shall not
with the rich man say, “Send Lazarus, that with the tip of his finger he may drop water on
my broiling678 tongue.” If here we receive Him into our house, there He will prepare many
mansions for us; if we go to Him in prison, He too will free us from our bonds; if we take
Him in when He is a stranger, He will not suffer us to be strangers to the Kingdom of
heaven, but will give us a portion in the City which is above; if we visit Him when He is sick,
He also will quickly deliver us from our infirmities.</p>
<p>Let us then, as receiving great things though we give but little, still give the little that
we may gain the great. While it is yet time, let us sow, that we may reap. When the winter
overtakes us, when the sea is no longer navigable, we are no longer masters of this traffic.
But when shall the winter be? When that great and manifest Day is at hand. Then we shall
cease to sail this great and broad sea, for such the present life resembles. Now is the time of
sowing, then of harvest and of gain. If a man puts not in his seed at seed time and sows in
harvest, besides that he effects nothing, he will be ridiculous. But if the present is seed time,
it follows that it is a time not for gathering together, but for scattering; let us then scatter,
that we may gather in, and not seek to gather in now, lest we lose our harvest; for, as I said,

this season summons us to sow, and spend, and lay out, not to collect and lay by. Let us not
then give up the opportunity, but let us put in abundant seed, and spare none of our stores,
that we may receive them again with abundant recompense, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXVI.
John iii. 6</head>
<p>“That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great mysteries are they, of which the Only-begotten Son of God has counted us
worthy; great, and such as we were not worthy of, but such as it was meet for Him to give.
For if one reckon our desert, we were not only unworthy of the gift, but also liable to punishment
and vengeance; but He, because He looked not to this, not only delivered us from
punishment, but freely gave us a life much more bright679 than the first, introduced us into
another world, made us another creature; “If any man be in Christ,” saith Paul, “he is a new
creature.” ( 2 Cor. v. 17.) What kind of “new creature”? Hear Christ Himself declare; “Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” Paradise
was entrusted to us, and we were shown unworthy to dwell even there, yet He hath exalted
us to heaven. In the first things we were found unfaithful, and He hath committed to us
greater; we could not refrain from a single tree, and He hath provided for us the delights680
above; we kept not our place in Paradise, and He hath opened to us the doors of heaven.
Well said Paul, “O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!” (
Rom. xi. 33.) There is no longer a mother, or pangs, or sleep, or coming together, and embracings
of bodies; henceforth all the fabric681 of our nature is framed above, of the Holy
Ghost and water. The water is employed, being made the Birth to him who is born; what
the womb is to the embryo, the water is to the believer; for in the water he is fashioned and
formed. At first it was said, “Let the waters bring forth the creeping things that have life” (
Gen. i. 20 , LXX.); but from the time that the Lord entered the streams of Jordan, the water
no longer gives forth the “creeping thing that hath life,” but reasonable and Spirit-bearing
souls; and what has been said of the sun, that he is “as a bridegroom coming out of his
chamber” ( Ps. xviii. 6 ), we may now rather say of the faithful, for they send forth rays far
brighter than he. That which is fashioned in the womb requires time, not so that in water,
but all is done in a single moment. Here our life is perishable, and takes its origin from the
decay of other bodies; that which is to be born comes slowly, (for such is the nature of
bodies, they acquire perfection by time,) but it is not so with spiritual things. And why?
Because the things made are formed perfect from the beginning.</p>
<p>When Nicodemus still hearing these things was troubled, see how Christ partly opens
to him the secret of this mystery, and makes that clear which was for a while obscure to him.

“That which is born,” saith He, “of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit.” He leads him away from all the things of sense, and suffers him not vainly to pry
into the mysteries revealed with his fleshly eyes; “We speak not,” saith He, “of flesh, but of
Spirit, O Nicodemus,” (by this word He directs him heavenward for a while,) “seek then
nothing relating to things of sense; never can the Spirit appear to those eyes, think not that
the Spirit bringeth forth the flesh.” “How then,” perhaps one may ask, “was the Flesh of the
Lord brought forth?” Not of the Spirit only, but of flesh; as Paul de clares, when he says,
“Made of a woman, made under the Law” ( Gal. iv. 4 ); for the Spirit fashioned Him not indeed
out of nothing, (for what need was there then of a womb?) but from the flesh of a
Virgin. How, I cannot explain unto you; yet it was done, that no one might suppose that
what was born is alien to our nature. For if even when this has taken place there are some
who disbelieve in such a birth, into what impiety would they not have fallen had He not
partaken of the Virgin’s flesh.</p>
<p>“That which is born682 of the Spirit is spirit.” Seest thou the dignity of the Spirit? It appears
performing the work of God; for above he said of some, that, “they were begotten of
God,” ( c. i. 13 ,) here He saith, that the Spirit begetteth them.</p>
<p>“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” His meaning is of this kind; “He that is born683
of the Spirit is spiritual.” For the Birth which He speaks of here is not that according to essence,
684 but according to honor and grace. Now if the Son is so born also, in what shall He
be superior to men so born? And how is He, Only-begotten? For I too am born of God,
though not of His Essence, and if He also is not of His Essence, how in this respect does He
differ from us? Nay, He will then be found to be inferior to the Spirit; for birth of this kind
is by the grace of the Spirit. Needs He then the help of the Spirit that He may continue a
Son? And in what do these differ from Jewish doctrines?</p>
<p>Christ then having said, “He that is born of the Spirit is spirit,” when He saw him again
confused, leads His discourse to an example from sense, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 7, 8. “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.685 The wind bloweth
where it listeth.”</p>
<p>For by saying, “Marvel not,” He indicates the confusion of his soul, and leads him to
something lighter than body. He had already led him away from fleshly things, by saying,
“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit”; but when Nicodemus knew not what “that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit” meant, He next carries him to another figure, not bringing him
to the density of bodies, nor yet speaking of things purely incorporeal, (for had he heard he

<note type="footnote">683 or, “begotten.”</note>

could not have received this,) but having found a something between what is and what is
not body, namely, the motion of the wind, He brings him to that next. And He saith of it,</p>
<p>“Thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
goeth.”</p>
<p>Though He saith, “it bloweth where it listeth,” He saith it not as if the wind had any
power of choice, but declaring that its natural motion cannot be hindered, and is with power.
For Scripture knoweth how to speak thus of things without life, as when it saith, “The
creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly.” ( Rom. viii. 20.) The expression therefore,
“bloweth where it listeth,” is that of one who would show that it cannot be restrained, that
it is spread abroad everywhere, and that none can hinder its passing hither and thither, but
that it goes abroad with great might, and none is able to turn aside its violence.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “And thou hearest its voice,”686 (that is, its rustle, its noise,) “but canst not tell
whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>Here is the conclusion of the whole matter. “If,” saith He, “thou knowest not how to
explain the motion nor the path of this wind687 which thou perceivest by hearing and touch,
why art thou over-anxious about the working of the Divine Spirit, when thou understandest
not that of the wind, though thou hearest its voice?” The expression, “bloweth where it
listeth,” is also used to establish the power of the Comforter; for if none can hold the wind,
but it moveth where it listeth, much less will the laws of nature, or limits of bodily generation,
or anything of the like kind, be able to restrain the operations of the Spirit.</p>
<p>That the expression, “thou hearest its voice,” is used respecting the wind, is clear from
this circumstance; He would not, when conversing with an unbeliever and one unacquainted
with the operation of the Spirit, have said, “Thou hearest its voice.” As then the wind is not
visible, although it utters a sound, so neither is the birth of that which is spiritual visible to
our bodily eyes; yet the wind is a body, although a very subtle one; for whatever is the object
of sense is body. If then you do not complain because you cannot see this body, and do not
on this account disbelieve, why do you, when you hear of “the Spirit,” hesitate and demand
such exact accounts, although you act not so in the case of a body? What then doth
Nicodemus? still he continues in his low Jewish opinion, and that too when so clear an example
has been mentioned to him. Wherefore when he again says doubtingly,</p>
<p>Ver. 9, 10. “How can these things be?” Christ now speaks to him more chidingly; “Art
thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?”</p>
<note type="footnote">686 φωνὴν.</note>
<note type="footnote">687 or, “spirit.”</note>

<pb n="186"/>
<p>Observe how He nowhere accuses the man of wickedness, but only of weakness and
simplicity. “And what,” one may ask, “has this birth in common with Jewish matters?” Tell
me rather what has it that is not in common with them? For the first-created man, and the
woman formed from his side, and the barren women, and the things accomplished by water,
I mean what relates to the fountain on which Elisha made the iron tool to swim, to the Red
Sea which the Jews passed over, to the pool which the Angel troubled, to Naaman the Syrian
who was cleansed in Jordan, all these proclaimed beforehand, as by a figure, the Birth and
the purification which were to be. And the words of the Prophet allude to the manner of
this Birth, as, “It shall be announced unto the Lord a generation which cometh, and they
shall announce His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath
made” ( Ps. xxii. 30; xxx. 31 , LXX.); and, “Thy youth shall be renewed as an eagle’s” ( Ps.
ciii. 5 , LXX.); and, “Shine, O Jerusalem; behold, Thy King cometh!” ( Isa. lx. 1; Zech. ix. 9
); and, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.” ( Ps. xxxii. 1 , LXX.) Isaac also was
a type of this Birth. For tell me, Nicodemus, how was he born? was it according to the law
of nature? By no means; the mode of his generation was midway between this of which we
speak and the natural; the natural, because he was begotten by cohabitation; the other, because
he was begotten not of blood,688 (but by the will of God.) I shall show that these figures689
proclaimed beforehand not only this birth, but also that from the Virgin. For, because no
one would easily have believed that a virgin could bear a child, barren women first did so,
then such as were not only barren, but aged also. That a woman should be made from a rib
was indeed far more wonderful than that the barren should conceive; but because that was
of early and old time, another figure, new and fresh, was given, that of the barren women;
to prepare the way for belief in the Virgin’s travail. To remind him then of these things, Jesus
said, “Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?”</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “We speak that We do know, and testify that We have seen, and none receiveth690
Our witness.”</p>
<p>This He added, making His words credible by another argument, and condescending
in His speech to the other’s infirmity.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And what is this that He saith, “We speak that We do know, and testify that We
have seen”? Because with us the sight is the most trustworthy of the senses, and if we desire
to gain a person’s belief, we speak thus, that we saw it with our eyes, not that we know it by
hearsay; Christ therefore speaks to him rather after the manner of men, gaining belief for
His words by this means also. And that this is so, and that He desires to establish nothing
else, and refers not to sensual vision, is clear from this; after saying, “That which is born of
<note type="footnote">688 lit “of bloods,” as in c. i. 13.</note>

the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,” He adds, “We speak that we
do know, and testify that we have seen.” Now this (of the Spirit) was not yet born691 ; how
then saith He, “what we have seen”? Is it not plain that He speaks of a knowledge not otherwise
than exact?</p>
<p>“And none receiveth our witness.” The expression “we know,” He uses then either
concerning Himself and His Father, or concerning Himself alone; and “no man receiveth,”
is the expression not of one displeased, but of one who declares a fact: for He said not, “What
can be more senseless than you who receive not what is so exactly declared by us?” but displaying
all gentleness, both by His works and His words, He uttered nothing like this; mildly
and kindly He foretold what should come to pass, so guiding us too to all gentleness, and
teaching us when we converse with any and do not persuade them, not to be annoyed or
made savage; for it is impossible for one out of temper to accomplish his purpose, he must
make him to whom he speaks still more incredulous. Wherefore we must abstain from anger,
and make our words in every way credible by avoiding not only wrath, but also loud
speaking692 for loud speaking is the fuel of passion.</p>
<p>Let us then bind693 the horse, that we may subdue the rider; let us clip the wings of our
wrath, so the evil shall no more rise to a height. A keen passion is anger, keen, and skillful
to steal our souls; therefore we must on all sides guard against its entrance. It were strange
that we should be able to tame wild beasts, and yet should neglect our own savage minds.
Wrath is a fierce fire, it devours all things; it harms the body, it destroys the soul, it makes
a man deformed 694 and ugly to look upon; and if it were possible for an angry person to
be visible to himself at the time of his anger, he would need no other admonition, for
nothing is more displeasing than an angry countenance. Anger is a kind of drunkenness,
or rather it is more grievous than drunkenness, and more pitiable than (possession of) a
dæmon. But if we be careful not to be loud in speech,695 we shall find this the best path to
sobriety of conduct.696 And therefore Paul would take away clamor as well as anger, when
he says, “Let all anger and clamor be put away from you.” ( Eph. iv. 31.) Let us then obey
this teacher of all wisdom, and when we are wroth with our servants, let us consider our

own trespasses, and be ashamed at their forbearance. For when thou art insolent, and thy
servant bears thy insults in silence, when thou actest unseemly, he like a wise man, take this
instead of any other warning. Though he is thy servant, he is still a man, has an immortal
soul, and has been honored with the same gifts as thee by your common Lord. And if he
who is our equal in more important and more spiritual things, on account of some poor
and trifling human superiority so meekly bears our injuries, what pardon can we deserve,
what excuse can we make, who cannot, or rather will not, be as wise through fear of God,
as he is through fear of us? Considering then all these things, and calling to mind our own
transgressions, and the common nature of man, let us be careful at all times to speak gently,
that being humble in heart we may find rest for our souls, both that which now is, and that
which is to come; which may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXVII.</head>
<p>John iii. 12, 13</p>
<p>“If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of
heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from
heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> What I have often said I shall now repeat, and shall not cease to say. What is that?
It is that Jesus, when about to touch on sublime doctrines, often contains Himself by reason
of the infirmity of His hearers, and dwells not for a continuance on subjects worthy of His
greatness, but rather on those which partake of condescension. For the sublime and great,
being but once uttered, is sufficient to establish that character, as far as we are able to hear
it; but unless more lowly sayings, and such as are nigh to697 the comprehension of the
hearers, were continually uttered, the more sublime would not readily take hold on a groveling
listener. And therefore of the sayings of Christ more are lowly than sublime. But yet
that this again may not work another mischief, by detaining the disciple here below, He
does not merely set before men His inferior sayings without first telling them why He utters
them; as, in fact, He has done in this place. For when He had said what He did concerning
Baptism, and the Generation by grace which takes place on earth, being desirous to admit698
them to that His own mysterious and incomprehensible Generation, He holds it in suspense
for a while, and admits them not, and then tells them His reason for not admitting them.
What is that? It is, the dullness and infirmity of His hearers. And referring to this He added
the words, “If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
you of heavenly things?” so that wherever He saith anything ordinary and humble, we must
attribute this to the infirmity of His audience.</p>
<p>The expression “earthly things,” some say is here used of the wind; that is, “If I have
given you an example from earthly things, and ye did not even so believe, how shall ye be
able to learn sublimer things?” And wonder not if He here call Baptism an “earthly” thing,
for He calls it so, either from its being performed on earth, or so naming it in comparison
with that His own most awful Generation. For though this Generation of ours is heavenly,
yet compared with that true Generation which is from the Substance of the Father, it is
earthly.</p>
<p>He does not say, “Ye have not understood,” but, “Ye have not believed”; for when a man
is ill disposed towards those things which it is possible to apprehend by the intellect, and
will not readily receive them, he may justly be charged with want of understanding; but
<note type="footnote">697 al. “touch.”</note>
<note type="footnote">698 καθεῖναι.</note>

<pb n="190"/>
when he receives not things which cannot be apprehended by reasoning, but only by faith,
the charge against him is no longer want of understanding, but unbelief. Leading him
therefore away from enquiring by reasonings into what had been said, He touches him more
severely by charging him with want of faith. If now we must receive our own Generation699
by faith, what do they deserve who are busy with their reasonings about that of the Only-
Begotten?</p>
<p>But perhaps some may ask, “And if the hearers were not to believe these sayings,
wherefore were they uttered?” Because though “they” believed not, those who came after
would believe and profit by them. Touching him therefore very severely, Christ goes on to
show that He knoweth not these things only, but others also, far more and greater than
these. And this He declared by what follows, when He said, “And no man hath ascended
up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.”</p>
<p>“And what manner of sequel is this?”700 asks one. The very closest, and entirely in unison
with what has gone before. For since Nicodemus had said, “We know that Thou art a
teacher come from God,” on this very point He sets him right, all but saying, “Think Me
not a teacher in such manner as were the many of the prophets who were of earth, for I have
come from heaven (but) now. None of the prophets hath ascended up thither, but I dwell
there.” Seest thou how even that which appears very exalted is utterly unworthy of his
greatness? For not in heaven only is He, but everywhere, and He fills all things; but yet He
speaks according to the infirmity of His hearer, desiring to lead him up little by little. And
in this place He called not the flesh “Son of Man,” but He now named, so to speak, His entire
Self from the inferior substance; indeed this is His wont, to call His whole Person701 often
from His Divinity, and often from His humanity.</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
Man be lifted up.”</p>
<p>This again seems to depend upon what has gone before, and this too has a very close
connection with it. For after having spoken of the very great benefaction that had come to
man by Baptism, He proceeds to mention another benefaction, which was the cause of this,
and not inferior to it; namely, that by the Cross. As also Paul arguing with the Corinthians
sets down these benefits together, when he says, “Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
baptized into the name of Paul?” for these two things most of all declare His unspeakable
love, that He both suffered for His enemies, and that having died for His enemies, He freely
gave to them by Baptism entire remission of their sins.</p>
<note type="footnote">699 i.e. the new Birth.</note>
<note type="footnote">700 i.e. how is this connected with what has gone before?</note>
<note type="footnote">701 τὸ πᾶν.</note>

<pb n="191"/>
<p><del>2.</del> But wherefore did He not say plainly, “I am about to be crucified,” instead of referring
His hearers to the ancient type? First, that you may learn that old things are akin to new,
and that the one are not alien to the other; next, that you may know that He came not unwillingly
to His Passion; and again, besides these reasons, that you may learn that no harm
arises to Him from the Fact,702 and that to many there springs from it salvation. For, that
none may say, “And how is it possible that they who believe on one crucified should be
saved, when he himself is holden of death?” He leads us to the ancient story. Now if the
Jews, by looking to the brazen image of a serpent, escaped death, much rather will they who
believe on the Crucified, with good reason enjoy a far greater benefit. For this703 takes place,
not through the weakness of the Crucified, or because the Jews are stronger than He, but
because “God loved the world,” therefore is His living Temple fastened to the Cross.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.”</p>
<p>Seest thou the cause of the Crucifixion, and the salvation which is by it? Seest thou the
relationship of the type to the reality? there the Jews escaped death, but the temporal, here
believers the eternal; there the hanging serpent healed the bites of serpents, here the Crucified
Jesus cured the wounds inflicted by the spiritual704 dragon; there he who looked with his
bodily eyes was healed, here he who beholds with the eyes of his understanding put off all
his sins; there that which hung was brass fashioned into the likeness of a serpent, here it was
the Lord’s Body, builded by the Spirit; there a serpent bit and a serpent healed, here death
destroyed and a Death saved. But the snake which destroyed had venom, that which saved
was free from venom; and so again was it here, for the death which slew us had sin with it,
as the serpent had venom; but the Lord’s Death was free from all sin, as the brazen serpent
from venom. For, saith Peter, “He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.” ( 1
Pet. ii. 22.) And this is what Paul also declares, “And having spoiled principalities and powers,
He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” ( Col. ii. 16.) For as some
noble champion by lifting on high and dashing down his antagonist, renders his victory
more glorious, so Christ, in the sight of all the world, cast down the adverse powers, and
having healed those who were smitten in the wilderness, delivered them from all venomous
beasts705 that vexed them, by being hung upon the Cross. Yet He did not say, “must hang,”
but, “must be lifted up” ( Acts xxviii. 4 ); for He used this which seemed the milder term,
on account of His hearer, and because it was proper to the type.706</p>

<p>Ver. 16. “God,” He saith, “so loved the world that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind: Marvel not that I am to be lifted up that ye may be saved,
for this seemeth good to the Father, and He hath so loved you as to give His Son for slaves,
and ungrateful slaves. Yet a man would not do this even for a friend, nor readily even for a
righteous man; as Paul has declared when he said, “Scarcely for a righteous man will one
die.” ( Rom. v. 7.) Now he spoke at greater length, as speaking to believers, but here Christ
speaks concisely, because His discourse was directed to Nicodemus, but still in a more significant
manner, for each word had much significance. For by the expression, “so loved,”
and that other, “God the world,” He shows the great strength of His love. Large and infinite
was the interval between the two. He, the immortal, who is without beginning, the Infinite
Majesty, they but dust and ashes, full of ten thousand sins, who, ungrateful, have at all times
offended Him; and these He “loved.” Again, the words which He added after these are alike
significant, when He saith, that “He gave His Only-begotten Son,” not a servant, not an
Angel, not an Archangel. And yet no one would show such anxiety for his own child, as
God did for His ungrateful servants.</p>
<p>His Passion then He sets before him not very openly, but rather darkly; but the advantage
of the Passion He adds in a clearer manner,707 saying, “That every one that believeth in
Him. should not perish, but have everlasting life.” For when He had said, “must be lifted
up,” and alluded to death, lest the hearer should be made downcast by these words, forming
some mere human opinions concerning Him, and supposing that His death was a ceasing
to be,708 observe how He sets this right, by saying, that He that was given was “The Son of
God,” and the cause of life, of everlasting life. He who procured life for others by death,
would not Himself be continually in death; for if they who believed on the Crucified perish
not, much less doth He perish who is crucified. He who taketh away the destitution of others
much more is He free from it; He who giveth life to others, much more to Himself doth He
well forth life. Seest thou that everywhere there is need of faith? For He calls the Cross the
fountain of life; which reason cannot easily allow, as the heathens now by their mocking
testify. But faith which goes beyond the weakness of reasoning, may easily receive and retain
it. And whence did God “so love the world”? From no other source but only from his
goodness.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us now be abashed at His love, let us be ashamed at the excess of His lovingkindness,
since He for our sakes spared not His Only-begotten Son, yet we spare our wealth to
our own injury; He for us gave His Own Son, but we for Him do not so much as despise
money, nor even for ourselves. And how can these things deserve pardon? If we see a man
<note type="footnote">707 al. “clearly and openly.”</note>
<note type="footnote">708 ἀ νυπαρξιὰν.</note>

<pb n="192"/>
submitting to sufferings and death for us, we set him before all others, count him among
our chief friends, place in his hands all that is ours, and deem it rather his than ours, and
even so do not think that we give him the return that he deserves. But towards Christ we
do not preserve even this degree of right feeling. He laid down His life for us, and poured
forth His precious Blood for our sakes, who were neither well-disposed nor good, while we
do not pour out even our money for our own sakes, and neglect Him who died for us, when
He is naked and a stranger; and who shall deliver us from the punishment that is to come?
For suppose that it were not God that punishes, but that we punished ourselves; should we
not give our vote against ourselves? should we not sentence ourselves to the very fire of hell,
for allowing Him who laid down His life for us, to pine with hunger? But why speak I of
money? had we ten thousand lives, ought we not to lay them all down for Him? and yet not
even so could we do what His benefits deserve. For he who confers a benefit in the first instance,
gives evident proof of his kindness, but he who has received one, whatever return
he makes, he repays as a debt, and does not bestow as a favor; especially when he who did
the first good turn was benefiting his enemies. And he who repays both bestows his gifts on
a benefactor, and himself reaps their fruit besides.709 But not even this induces us; more
foolish are we than any, putting golden necklaces about our servants and mules and horses,
and neglecting our Lord who goes about naked, and passes from door to door, and ever
stands at our outlets, and stretches forth His hands to us, but often regarding Him with
unpitying eye; yet these very things He undergoeth for our sake. Gladly710 doth He hunger
that thou mayest be fed; naked doth He go that He may provide for thee the materials711
for a garment of incorruption, yet not even so do ye give up any of your own. Some of your
garments are moth-eaten, others are a load to your coffers, and a needless trouble to their
possessors, while He who gave you these and all else that you possess goeth naked.</p>
<p>But perhaps you do not lay them by in your coffers, but wear them and make yourself
fine with them. And what gain you by this? Is it that the street people may see you? What
then? They will not admire thee who wearest such apparel, but the man who supplies garments
to the needy; so if you desire to be admired, by clothing others, you will the rather
get infinite applause. Then too God as well as man shall praise thee; now none can praise,
but all will grudge at thee, seeing thee with a body well arrayed, but having a neglected soul.
So harlots have adornment, and their clothes are often more than usually expensive and
splendid; but the adornment of the soul is with those only who live in virtue.</p>
<p>These things I say continually, and I will not cease to say them, not so much because I
care for the poor, as because I care for your souls. For they will have some comfort, if not

from you, yet from some other quarter; or even if they be not comforted, but perish by
hunger, the harm to them will be no great matter. What did poverty and wasting by hunger
injure Lazarus! But none can rescue you from hell, if you obtain not the help of the poor;
712 we shall say to you what was said to the rich man, who was continually broiling, yet
gained no comfort. God grant that none ever hear those words, but that all may go into the
bosom of Abraham; by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John iii. 17</p>
<p>“For God sent not His Son713 to condemn the world, but to save the world.”714</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Many of the more careless sort of persons, using the lovingkindness of God to increase
the magnitude of their sins and the excess of their disregard, speak in this way, “There
is no hell, there is no future punishment, God forgives us all sins.” To stop whose mouths
a wise man says, “Say not, His mercy is great, He will be pacified for the multitude of my
sins; for mercy and wrath come from Him, and His indignation resteth upon sinners” (
Ecclus. v. 6 ): and again, “As His mercy is great, so is His correction also.” ( Ecclus. xvi. 12.)
“Where then,” saith one, “is His lovingkindness, if we shall receive for our sins according
to our deserts?” That we shall indeed receive “according to our deserts,” hear both the
Prophet and Paul declare; one says, “Thou shalt render to every man according to his work”
( Ps. lxii. 12 , LXX.); the other, “Who will render to every man according to his work.” (
Rom. ii. 6.) And yet we may see that even so the lovingkindness of God is great; in dividing
our existence715 into two periods,716 the present life and that which is to come, and making
the first to be an appointment of trial, the second a place of crowning, even in this He hath
shown great lovingkindness.</p>
<p>“How and in what way?” Because when we had committed many and grievous sins, and
had not ceased from youth to extreme old age to defile our souls with ten thousand evil
deeds, for none of these sins did He demand from us a reckoning, but granted us remission
of them by the washing717 of Regeneration, and freely gave us Righteousness and Sanctification.
“What then,” says one, “if a man who from his earliest age has been deemed worthy
of the mysteries, after this commits ten thousand sins?” Such an one deserves a severer
punishment. For we do not pay the same penalties for the same sins, if we do wrong after
Initiation.718 And this Paul declares, saying, “He that despised Moses’ law died without
mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he
be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?” (
Heb. x. 28, 29.) Such an one then is worthy of severer punishment.719 Yet even for him God
<note type="footnote">713 [εἰς τὸν κόσμον, G. T.]</note>

<note type="footnote">719 Morel. “he then will be more severely punished who has sinned after grace.”</note>

<pb n="196"/>
hath opened doors of repentance, and hath granted him many means for the washing away
his transgressions, if he will. Think then what proofs of lovingkindness these are; by Grace
to remit sins, and not to punish him who after grace has sinned and deserves punishment,
but to give him a season and appointed space for his clearing.720 For all these reasons Christ
said to Nicodemus, “God sent not His Son to condemn the world, but to save the world.”</p>
<p>For there are two Advents of Christ, that which has been, and that which is to be; and
the two are not for the same purpose; the first came to pass not that He might search into
our actions, but that He might remit; the object of the second will be not to remit, but to
enquire. Therefore of the first He saith, “I came not to condemn the world, but to save the
world” ( c. iii. 17 ); but of the second, “When the Son shall have come in the glory of His
Father,721 He shall set the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left.” ( Matt. xxv.
31, 46.) And they shall go, these into life; and these into eternal punishment. Yet His former
coming was for judgment, according to the rule of justice. Why? Because before His coming
there was a law of nature, and the prophets, and moreover a written Law, and doctrine, and
ten thousand promises, and manifestations of signs, and chastisements, and vengeances,
and many other things which might have set men right, and it followed that for all these
things He would demand account; but, because He is merciful, He for a while pardons instead
of making enquiry. For had He done so, all would at once have been hurried to perdition.
For “all,” it saith, “have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” ( Rom. iii. 23.) Seest
thou the unspeakable excess of His lovingkindness?</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “He that believeth on the Son,722 is not judged;723 but he that believeth not, is
judged already.”</p>
<p>Yet if He “came not to judge the world,” how is “he that believeth not judged already,”
if the time of “judgment” has not yet arrived? He either means this, that the very fact of
disbelieving without repentance is a punishment, (for to be without the light, contains in
itself a very severe punishment,) or he announces beforehand what shall be. For as the
murderer, though he be not as yet condemned by the decision of the judge, is still condemned
by the nature of the thing, so is it with the unbeliever. Since Adam also died on the day that
he ate of the tree; for so ran the decree, “In the day that ye eat of the tree, ye shall die” ( Gen.
ii. 17 , LXX.); yet he lived. How then “died” he? By the decree; by the very nature of the
thing; for he who has rendered himself liable to punishment, is under its penalty, and if for
a while not actually so, yet he is by the sentence.</p>
<note type="footnote">720 προθεσμίαν ἀπολογίας</note>
<note type="footnote">721 τῇ δοξῇ αὐτοῦ. G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">722 εἰς αὐτὸν, G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">723 or, “condemned,” E.V.</note>

<pb n="197"/>
<p>Lest any one on hearing, “I came not to judge the world,” should imagine that he might
sin unpunished, and should so become more careless, Christ stops724 such disregard by
saying, “is judged already”; and because the “judgment” was future and not yet at hand, He
brings near the dread of vengeance, and describes the punishment as already come. And
this is itself a mark of great lovingkindness, that He not only gives His Son, but even delays
the time of judgment, that they who have sinned, and they who believe not, may have power
to wash away their transgressions.</p>
<p>“He that believeth on the Son, is not judged.” He that “believeth,” not he that is overcurious:
he that “believeth,” not the busybody. But what if his life be unclean, and his deeds
evil? It is of such as these especially that Paul declares, that they are not true believers at all:
“They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.” ( Tit. i. 16.) But here Christ
saith, that such an one is not “judged” in this one particular; for his works indeed he shall
suffer a severer punishment, but having believed once, he is not chastised for unbelief.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Seest thou how having commenced His discourse with fearful things, He has concluded
it again with the very same? for at first He saith, “Except a man be born of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God”: and here again, “He that believeth
not on the Son, is judged already.” “Think not,” He saith, “that the delay advantageth at all
the guilty, except he repent, for he that hath not believed, shall be in no better state than
those who are already condemned and under punishment.”</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
darkness rather than light.”</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind: “they are punished, because they would not leave the
darkness, and hasten to the light.” And hence He goes on to deprive them of all excuse for
the future: “Had I come,” saith He, “to punish and to exact account of their deeds, they
might have been able to say, ‘this is why we started away from thee,’ but now I am come to
free them from darkness, and to bring them to the light; who then could pity one who will
not come from darkness unto light? When they have no charge to bring against us, but have
received ten thousand benefits, they start away from us.” And this charge He hath brought
in another place, where He saith, “They hated Me without a cause” ( John xv. 25 ): and again,
“If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.” ( John xv. 22.) For he who
in the absence of light sitteth in darkness, may perchance receive pardon; but one who after
it is come abides by the darkness, produces against himself a certain proof of a perverse and
contentious disposition. Next, because His assertion would seem incredible to most, (for
none would prefer “darkness to light,”) He adds the cause of such a feeling in them. What
is that?</p>
<note type="footnote">724 lit. “walls off.”</note>

<pb n="198"/>
<p>Ver. 19, 20. “Because,” He saith, “their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil,
hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.”</p>
<p>Yet he came not to judge or to enquire, but to pardon and remit transgressions, and to
grant salvation through faith. How then fled they?725 Had He come and sat in His Judgment
seat, what He said might have seemed reasonable; for he that is conscious to himself of evil
deeds, is wont to fly his judge. But, on the contrary, they who have transgressed even run
to one who is pardoning. If therefore He came to pardon, those would naturally most hasten
to Him who were conscious to themselves of many transgressions; and indeed this was the
case with many, for even publicans and sinners sat at meat with Jesus. What then is this
which He saith? He saith this of those who choose always to remain in wickedness. He indeed
came, that He might forgive men’s former sins, and secure them against those to come; but
since there are some so relaxed,726 so powerless for the toils of virtue, that they desire to
abide by wickedness till their latest breath, and never cease from it, He speaks in this place
reflecting727 upon these. “For since,” He saith, “the profession of Christianity requires besides
right doctrine a sound conversation also, they fear to come over to us, because they like not
to show forth a righteous life. Him that lives in heathenism none would blame, because with
gods such as he has, and with rites as foul and ridiculous as his gods, he shows forth actions
that suit his doctrines; but those who belong to the True God, if they live a careless life, have
all men to call them to account, and to accuse them. So greatly do even its enemies admire
the truth.” Observe, then, how exactly He layeth down what He saith. His expression is, not
“He that hath done evil cometh not to the light,” but “he that doeth it always, he that desireth
always to roll himself in the mire of sin, he will not subject himself to My laws, but chooses
to stay without, and to commit fornication without fear, and to do all other forbidden things.
For if he comes to Me, he becomes manifest as a thief in the light, and therefore he avoids
My dominion.” For instance, even now one may hear many heathen say, “that they cannot
come to our faith, because they cannot leave off drunkenness and fornication, and the like
disorders.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says some one, “but are there no Christians that do evil, and heathens that live
discreetly?”728 That there are Christians who do evil, I know; but whether there are heathens
who live a righteous life, I do not yet know assuredly. For do not speak to me of those who
by nature are good and orderly, (this is not virtue,) but tell me of the man who can endure
the exceeding violence of his passions and (yet) be temperate.729 You cannot. For if the

promise of a Kingdom, and the threat of hell, and so much other provision,730 can scarcely
keep men in virtue, they will hardly go after virtue who believe in none of these things. Or,
if any pretend to do so, they do it for show; and he who doth so for show, will not, when he
may escape observation, refrain from indulging his evil desires. However, that we may not
seem to any to be contentious, let us grant that there are right livers among the heathen; for
neither doth this go against my argument, since I spoke of that which occurs in general, not
of what happens rarely.</p>
<p>And observe how in another way He deprives them of all excuse, when He saith that,
“the light came into the world.” “Did they seek it themselves,” He saith, “did they toil, did
they labor to find it? The light itself came to them, and not even so would they hasten to it.”
And if there be some Christians who live wickedly, I would argue that He doth not say this
of those who have been Christians from the beginning, and who have inherited true religion
from their forefathers, (although even these for the most part have been shaken from731
right doctrine by their evil life,) yet still I think that He doth not now speak concerning
these, but concerning the heathen and the Jews who ought to have come732 to the right
faith. For He showeth that no man living in error would choose to come to the truth unless
he before had planned733 for himself a righteous life, and that none would remain in unbelief
unless he had previously chosen always to be wicked.</p>
<p>Do not tell me that a man is temperate, and does not rob; these things by themselves
are not virtue. For what advantageth it, if a man has these things, and yet is the slave of
vainglory, and remains in his error, from fear of the company of his friends? This is not
right living. The slave of a reputation734 is no less a sinner than the fornicator; nay, he
worketh more and more grievous deeds than he. But tell me of any one that is free from all
passions and from all iniquity, and who remains among the heathen. Thou canst not do so;
for even those among them who have boasted great things, and who have, as they say,735
mastered avarice or gluttony, have been, most of all men, the slaves of reputation,736 and
this is the cause of all evils. Thus it is that the Jews also have continued Jews; for which cause
Christ rebuked them and said, “How can ye believe, which receive honor from men?” ( c.
v. 44.)</p>

<p>“And why, pray, did He not speak on these matters with Nathanael, to whom He testified
of the truth, nor extend His discourse to any length?” Because even he came not with such
zeal as did Nicodemus. For Nicodemus made this his work,737 and the season which others
used for rest he made a season for hearing; but Nathanael came at the instance of another.
Yet not even him did Jesus entirely pass by, for to him He saith, “Hereafter ye shall see
heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” ( c.
i. 51.) But to Nicodemus He spake not so, but conversed with him on the Dispensation and
on eternal life, addressing each differently and suitably to the condition of his will. It was
sufficient for Nathanael, because he knew the writings of the prophets, and was not so timid
either, to hear only thus far; but because Nicodemus was as yet possessed by fear, Christ did
not indeed clearly reveal to him the whole, but shook his mind so as to cast out fear by fear,
declaring that he who did not believe was being judged,738 and that unbelief proceeded from
an evil conscience. For since he made great account of honor from men, more than he did
of the punishment; (“Many,” saith the Evangelist, “of the rulers believed on Him, but because
of the Jews they did not confess”— c. xii. 42 ;) on this point Christ toucheth him, saying,
“It cannot be that he who believeth not on Me disbelieveth for any other cause save that he
liveth an unclean life.” Farther on He saith, “I am the Light” ( c. viii. 12 ), but here, “the
Light came into the world”; for at the beginning He spoke somewhat darkly, but afterwards
more clearly. Yet even so the man was kept back by regard for the opinion of the many, and
therefore could not endure to speak boldly as he ought.</p>
<p>Fly we then vainglory, for this is a passion more tyrannical than any. Hence spring
covetousness and love of wealth, hence hatred and wars and strifes; for he that desires more
than he has, will never be able to stop, and he desires from no other cause, but only from
his love of vainglory. For tell me, why do so many encircle themselves with multitudes of
eunuchs, and herds of slaves, and much show? Not because they need it, but that they may
make those who meet them witnesses of this unseasonable display. If then we cut this off,
we shall slay together with the head the other members also of wickedness, and there will
be nothing to hinder us from dwelling on earth as though it were heaven. Nor doth this vice
merely thrust its captives into wickedness, but is even co-existent739 with their virtues, and
when it is unable entirely to cast us out of these, it still causeth us much damage in the very
exercise of them, forcing us to undergo the toil, and depriving us of the fruit. For he that
with an eye to this, fasts, and prays, and shows mercy, has his reward. What can be more
pitiable than a loss like this, that it should befall man to bewail740 himself uselessly and in
<note type="footnote">737 i.e. his one great object.</note>

vain, and to become an object of ridicule, and to lose the glory from above? Since he that
aims at both cannot obtain both. It is indeed possible to obtain both, when we desire not
both, but one only, that from heaven; but he cannot obtain both, who longs for both.
Wherefore if we wish to attain to glory, let us flee from human glory, and desire that only
which cometh from God; so shall we obtain both the one and the other; which may we all
enjoy, through the grace and loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXIX.</head>
<p>John iii. 22</p>
<p>“And He came and His disciples into the land of Judæa, and there He tarried with them (and
baptized).”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Nothing can be clearer or mightier than the truth, just as nothing is weaker than
falsehood, though it be shaded by ten thousand veils. For even so it is easily detected, it
easily melts away. But truth stands forth unveiled for all that will behold her beauty; she
seeks no concealment, dreads no danger, trembles at no plots, desires not glory from the
many, is accountable to no mortal thing, but stands above them all, is the object of ten
thousand secret plots, yet remaineth unconquerable, and guards as in a sure fortress these
who fly to her by her own exceeding might, who avoids secret lurking places, and setteth
what is hers before all men. And this Christ conversing with Pilate declared, when He said,
“I ever taught openly, and in secret have I said nothing.” ( c. xviii. 20.) As He spake then, so
He acted now, for, “After this,” saith the Evangelist, “He went forth and His disciples into
the land of Judæa, and there He tarried with them and baptized.” At the feasts He went up
to the City to set forth in the midst of them His doctrines, and the help of His miracles; but
after the feasts were over, He often went to Jordan, because many ran together there. For
He ever chose the most crowded places, not from any love of show or vainglory, but because
He desired to afford His help to the greatest number.</p>
<p>Yet the Evangelist farther on says, that “Jesus baptized not, but His disciples”; whence
it is clear that this is his meaning here also. And why did Jesus not baptize? The Baptist had
said before, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” Now he had not yet
given the Spirit, and it was therefore with good cause that he did not baptize. But His disciples
did so, because they desired to bring many to the saving doctrine.</p>
<p>“And why, when the disciples of Jesus were baptizing, did not John cease to do so? why
did he continue to baptize, and that even until he was led to prison? for to say,</p>
<p>Ver. 23. ‘John also was baptizing in Ænon’; and to add,</p>
<p>Ver. 24. ‘John was not yet cast into prison,’ was to declare that until that time he did
not cease to baptize. But wherefore did he baptize until then? For he would have made the
disciples of Jesus seem more reverend had he desisted when they began. Why then did he
baptize?” It was that he might not excite his disciples to even stronger rivalry, and make
them more contentious still. For if, although he ten thousand times proclaimed Christ,
yielded to Him the chief place, and made himself so much inferior, he still could not persuade
them to run to Him; he would, had he added this also, have made them yet more hostile.
On this account it was that Christ began to preach more constantly when John was removed.
And moreover, I think that the death of John was allowed, and that it happened very quickly,

<pb n="203"/>
in order that the whole attention741 of the multitude might be shifted to Christ, and that
they might no longer be divided in their opinions concerning the two.</p>
<p>Besides, even while he was baptizing, he did not cease continually to exhort them, and
to show them the high and awful nature of Jesus. For He baptized them, and told them no
other thing than that they must believe on Him that came after him. Now how would a man
who acted thus by desisting have made the disciples of Christ seem worthy of reverence?
On the contrary, he would have been thought to do so through envy and passion. But to
continue preaching gave a stronger proof; for he desired not glory for himself, but sent on
his hearers to Christ, and wrought with Him not less, but rather much more than Christ’s
own disciples, because his testimony was unsuspected and he was by all men far more highly
esteemed than they. And this the Evangelist implies, when he says, “all Judæa and the
country around about Jordan went out to him and were baptized.” ( Matt. iii. 5.) Even when
the disciples were baptizing, yet many did not cease to run to him.</p>
<p>If any one should enquire, “And in what was the baptism of the disciples better than
that of John?” we will reply, “in nothing”; both were alike without the gift of the Spirit, both
parties alike had one reason for baptizing, and that was, to lead the baptized to Christ. For
in order that they might not be always running about to bring together those that should
believe, as in Simon’s case his brother did, and Philip to Nathanael, they instituted baptism,
in order by it to bring all men to them easily, and to prepare a way for the faith which was
to be. But that the baptisms had no superiority one over the other, is shown by what follows.
What is that?</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “There arose,” saith the Evangelist, “a question (between some) of John’s disciples
and the Jews about purifying.”</p>
<p>For the disciples of John being ever jealously disposed towards Christ’s disciples and
Christ Himself, when they saw them baptizing, began to reason with those who were baptized,
as though their baptism was in a manner superior to that of Christ’s disciples; and taking
one of the baptized, they tried to persuade him of this; but persuaded him not. Hear how
the Evangelist has given us to understand that it was they who attacked him, not he who set
on foot the question. He doth not say, that “a certain Jew questioned with them,” but that,
“there arose a questioning from the disciples of John with a certain Jew,742 concerning
purification.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And observe, I pray you, the Evangelist’s inoffensiveness. He does not speak in the
way of invective, but as far as he is able softens the charge, merely saying, that “a question
<note type="footnote">741 διάθεσιν</note>
<note type="footnote">742 ̓ Ιουδαίου τινός. This reading is found in the Complut. and in most of the Greek commentators: the
plural in G. T., Vulgate, and Latin writers.</note>

<pb n="204"/>
arose”; whereas the sequel (which he has also set down in an inoffensive manner) makes it
plain that what was said was said from jealousy.</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “They came,” saith he, “unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, He that was with
thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold the same baptizeth, and all men
come to Him.”</p>
<p>That is, “He whom thou didst baptize”; for this they imply when they say, “to whom
thou barest witness,” as though they had said, “He whom thou didst point out as illustrious,
and make remarkable, dares to do the same as thou.” Yet they do not say, “He whom thou
didst baptize” baptizeth; (for then they would have been obliged to make mention of the
Voice that came down from heaven, and of the descent of the Spirit;) but what say they?
“He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness”; that is, “He who held
the rank of a disciple, who was nothing more than we, this man hath separated himself, and
baptizeth.” For they thought to make him jealous,743 not only by this, but by asserting that
their own reputation was now diminishing. “All,” say they, “come to Him.” Whence it is
evident, that they did not get the better of the Jew with whom they disputed; but they spoke
these words because they were imperfect in disposition, and were not yet clear from a feeling
of rivalry. What then doth John? He did not rebuke them severely, fearing lest they should
separate themselves again from him, and work some other mischief. What are his words?744
Ver. 27. “A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from above.”</p>
<p>Marvel not, if he speak of Christ in a lowly strain; it was impossible to teach all at once,
and from the very beginning, men so pre-occupied by passion. But he desires to strike them
for a while with awe and terror, and to show them that they warred against none other than
God Himself, when they warred against Christ. And here he secretly establishes that truth,
which Gamaliel asserted, “Ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against
God.” ( Acts v. 39.) For to say, “None can receive anything, except it be given him from
heaven,” was nothing else than declaring that they were attempting impossibilities, and so
would be found to fight against God. “Well, but did not Theudas and his followers ‘receive’
from themselves?” They did, but they straightway were scattered and destroyed, not so what
belonged to Christ.</p>
<p>By this also he gently consoles them, showing them that it was not a man, but God, who
surpassed them in honor; and that therefore they must not wonder if what belonged to Him
was glorious, and if “all men came unto Him”: for that this was the nature of divine things,
and that it was God who brought them to pass, because no man ever yet had power to do
such deeds. All human things are easily seen through, and rotten, and quickly melt away
and perish; these were not such, therefore not human. Observe too how when they said, “to
<note type="footnote">743 παρακνίζειν</note>
<note type="footnote">744 Morel. “but he speaks in a manner reservedly.”</note>

<pb n="205"/>
whom thou barest witness,” he turned against themselves that which they thought they had
put forward to lower Christ, and silences them after showing that Jesus’ glory came not
from his testimony; “A man cannot,” he saith, “receive anything of himself, except it be
given him from heaven.” “If ye hold at all to my testimony, and believe it to be true, know
that by that testimony ye ought to prefer not me to Him, but Him to me. For what was it
that I testified? I call you yourselves to witness.”</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am
sent before Him.”</p>
<p>“If then ye hold to my testimony, (and ye even now produce it when ye say, ‘to whom
thou barest witness,’) He is not only not diminished by receiving my witness, but rather is
increased by it; besides, the testimony was not mine, but God’s. So that if I seem to you to
be trustworthy, I said this among other things, that ‘I am sent before Him.’” Seest thou how
he shows little by little that this Voice was divine? For what he saith is of this kind: “I am a
servant, and say the words of Him that sent me, not flattering Christ through human favor,
but serving His Father who sent me. I gave not the testimony as a gift,745 but what I was
sent to speak, I spake. Do not then because of this suppose that I am great, for it shows that
He is great. He is Lord of all things.” This he goes on to declare, and says,</p>
<p>Ver. 29. “He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom
which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.”</p>
<p>“But how doth he who said, ‘whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose,’746 now
call himself His ‘friend’?” It is not to exalt himself, nor boastingly, that he saith this, but
from desire to show that he too most forwards this, (i.e. the exaltation of Christ,) and that
these things come to pass not against his will or to his grief, but that he desires and is eager
for them, and that it was with a special view to them that all his actions had been performed;
and this he has very wisely shown by the term “friend.” For on occasions like marriages, the
servants of the bridegroom are not so glad and joyful as his “friends.” It was not from any
desire to prove equality of honor, (away with the thought,) but only excess of pleasure, and
moreover from condescension to their weakness that he calleth himself “friend.” For his
service he before declared747 by saying, “I am sent before Him.” On this account, and because
they thought that he was vexed at what had taken place, he called himself the “friend of the
Bridegroom,” to show that he was not only not vexed, but that he even greatly rejoiced.
<note type="footnote">745 ἐ χαρισάμην</note>
<note type="footnote">746 c. i. 27</note>
<note type="footnote">747 al. “implied.”</note>

<pb n="206"/>
“For,” saith he, “I came to effect this, and am so far from grieving at what has been done,
that had it not come to pass, I should then have been greatly grieved. Had the bride not
come to the Bridegroom, then I should have been grieved, but not now, since my task has
been accomplished. When His servants748 are advancing, we are they who gain the honor;
for that which we desired hath come to pass, and the bride knoweth the Bridegroom, and
ye are witnesses of it when ye say, ‘All men come unto Him.’ This I earnestly desired, I did
all to this end; and now when I see that it has come to pass, I am glad, and rejoice, and leap
for joy.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But what meaneth, “He which standeth and heareth Him rejoiceth greatly, because
of the Bridegroom’s voice”? He transfers the expression from the parable to the subject in
hand; for after mentioning the bridegroom and the bride, he shows how the bride is brought
home, that is, by a “Voice” and teaching. For thus the Church is wedded to God; and
therefore Paul saith, “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” ( Rom. x.
17 .) “At this ‘Voice,’” saith he, “I rejoice.” And not without a cause doth he put “who standeth,”
but to show that his office had ceased, that he had given over to Him “the Bride,” and
must for the future stand and hear Him; that he was a servant and minister; that his good
hope and his joy was now accomplished. Therefore he saith,</p>
<p>“This my joy therefore is fulfilled.”</p>
<p>That is to say, “The work is finished which was to be done by me, for the future I can
do nothing more.” Then, to prevent increase of jealous feeling, not then only, but for the
future, he tells them also of what should come to pass, confirming this too by what he had
already said and done.749 Therefore he continues,</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “He must increase, but I must decrease.”</p>
<p>That is to say, “What is mine has now come to a stand, and has henceforth ceased, but
what is His increaseth; for that which ye fear shall not be now only, but much more as it
advances. And it is this especially which shows what is mine the brighter; for this end I came,
and I rejoice that what is His hath made so great progress, and that those things have come
to pass on account of which all that I did was done.” Seest thou how gently and very wisely
he softened down their passion, quenched their envy, showed them that they were undertaking
impossibilities, a method by which wickedness is best checked? For this purpose it
was ordained, that these things should take place while John was yet alive and baptizing, in
order that his disciples might have him as a witness of the superiority of Christ, and that if
they should not believe,750 they might be without excuse. For John came not to say these
words of his own accord, nor in answer to other enquirers, but they asked the question
<note type="footnote">748 or “affairs.”</note>
<note type="footnote">749 So Savile and mss. Morel.’s reading has the same sense, but is less clear and concise.</note>
<note type="footnote">750 or, “obey.”</note>

<pb n="207"/>
themselves, and heard the answer. For if he had spoken of himself, their belief would not
have been equal to the self-condemning751 judgment which they received when they heard
him answer to their question; just as the Jews also, in that they sent to him from their homes,
heard what they did, and yet would not believe, by this especially deprived themselves of
excuse.</p>
<p>What then are we taught by this? That a mad desire of glory752 is the cause of all evils;
this led them to jealousy, and when they had ceased for a little, this roused them to it again.
Wherefore they come to Jesus, and say, “Why do thy disciples fast not?” ( Matt. ix. 14.) Let
us then, beloved, avoid this passion; for if we avoid this we shall escape hell. For this vice
specially kindles the fire of hell, and everywhere extends753 its role, and tyrannically occupies
every age and every rank.754 This hath turned churches upside down, this is mischievous
in state matters, hath subverted houses, and cities, and peoples, and nations. Why marvelest
thou? It hath even gone forth into the desert, and manifested even there its great power. For
men who have bidden an entire farewell to riches and all the show of the world, who converse
with no one, who have gained the mastery over the more imperious desires after the flesh,
these very men, made captives by vainglory, have often lost all. By reason of this passion,
one who had labored much went away worse off than one who had not labored at all, but
on the contrary had committed ten thousand sins; the Pharisee than the Publican. However,
to condemn the passion is easy enough, (all agree in doing that,) but the question is, how
to get the better of it. How can we do this? By setting honor against honor. For as we despise
the riches of earth when we look to the other riches, as we contemn this life when we think
of that far better than this, so we shall be enabled to spit on this world’s glory, when we
know of another far more august than it, which is glory indeed. One is a thing vain and
empty, has the name without the reality; but that other, which is from heaven, is true, and
has to give its praise Angels, and Archangels, and the Lord of Archangels, or rather I should
say that it has men as well. Now if thou lookest to that theater, learnest what crowns are
there, transportest thyself into the applauses which come thence, never will earthly things
be able to hold thee, nor when they come wilt thou deem them great, nor when they are
away seek after them. For even in earthly palaces none of the guards who stand around the
king, neglecting to please him that wears the diadem and sits upon the throne, troubles
himself about the voices of daws, or the noise of flies and gnats flying and buzzing about
him; and good report from men is no better than these. Knowing then the worthlessness of
human things,755 let us collect our all into treasuries that cannot be spoiled, let us seek that

<head>Homily XXX.</head>
<p>John iii. 31</p>
<p>“He that cometh from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the
earth.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A dreadful thing is the love of glory, dreadful and full of many evils; it is a thorn
hard to be extracted, a wild beast untamable and many headed, arming itself against those
that feed it; for as the worm eats through the wood from which it is born, as rust wastes the
iron whence it comes forth, and moths the fleeces, so vainglory destroys the soul which
nourishes it; and therefore we need great diligence to remove the passion. Observe here how
long a charm John uses over756 the disciples affected by it, and can scarcely pacify them.
For he softens757 them with other words besides those already mentioned. And what are
these others? “He that cometh from above,” he saith, “is above all; he that is of the earth, is
earthly, and speaketh of the earth.” Since you make much ado with my testimony,758 and
in this way say that I am more worthy of credit than He, you needs must know this, that it
is impossible for One who cometh from heaven to have His credit strengthened by one that
inhabiteth earth.</p>
<p>And what means “above all,” what is the expression intended to show to us? That Christ
hath need of nothing, but is Himself sufficient for Himself, and incomparably greater than
all; of himself John speaks as being “of the earth, and speaking of the earth.” Not that he
spake of his own mind, but as Christ said, “If I have told you of earthly things and ye believe
not,” so calling Baptism, not because it was an “earthly thing,” but because He compared it
when He spake with His own Ineffable Generation, so here John said that he spake “of
earth,” comparing his own with Christ’s teaching. For the “speaking of earth” means nothing
else than this, “My things are little and low and poor compared with His, and such as it was
probable that an earthly nature would receive. In Him ‘are hid all the treasures of wisdom.’”
( Col. ii. 5.) That he speaks not of human reasonings is plain from this. “He that is of the
earth,” saith he, “is earthly.” Yet not all in him was earthly, but the higher parts were heavenly,
for he had a soul, and was partaker of a Spirit which was not of earth. How then saith he
that he is “earthly”? Seest thou not that he means only, “I am small and of no esteem, going
on the ground and born in the earth; but Christ came to us from above.” Having by all these
means quenched their passion, he afterwards speaks more openly of Christ; for before this
<note type="footnote">756 ὅ σα ἐπᾴδει</note>
<note type="footnote">757 ἐ παντλεῖ, lit. “foments.”</note>
<note type="footnote">758 ἄ νω καὶ κάτω στρέφετε</note>

<pb n="210"/>
it was useless to utter words which could never have gained a place in the understanding of
his hearers: but when he hath pulled up the thorns, he then boldly casts in the seed, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 31, 32. “He that cometh from above is above all. And what He hath heard He
speaketh, and what He hath seen He testifieth;759 and no man receiveth His testimony.”</p>
<p>Having uttered something great and sublime concerning Him, he again brings down
his discourse to a humbler strain. For the expression, “what He hath heard and seen,” is
suited rather to a mere man. What He knew He knew not from having learned it by sight,
or from having heard it, but He included the whole in His Nature, having come forth perfect
from the Bosom of His Father, and needing none to teach Him. For, “As the Father,” He
saith, “knoweth Me, even so know I the Father.” ( c. x. 15.) What then means, “He speaketh
that He hath heard, and testifieth that He hath seen”? Since by these senses we gain correct
knowledge of everything, and are deemed worthy of credit when we teach on matters which
our eyes have embraced and our ears have taken in, as not in such cases inventing or
speaking falsehoods, John desiring here to establish this point, 760 said, “What He hath
heard and seen”: that is, “nothing that cometh from Him is false, but all is true.” Thus we
when we are making curious enquiry into anything, often ask, “Didst thou hear it?” “Didst
thou see it?” And if this be proved, the testimony is indubitable, and so when Christ Himself
saith, “As I hear, I judge” ( c. v. 30 ); and, “What I have heard from My Father, that I speak”
761 ( c. xv. 15 ); and, “We speak762 that We have seen” ( c. iii. 11 ); and whatsoever other
sayings He uttereth of the kind, are uttered not that we might imagine that He saith what
He doth being taught of any, (it were extreme folly to think this,) but in order that nothing
of what is said may be suspected by the shameless Jews. For because they had not yet a right
opinion concerning Him, He continually betakes Himself to His Father, and hence makes
His sayings credible.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And why wonderest thou if He betake Himself to the Father, when He often resorts
to the Prophets and the Scriptures? as when He saith, “They are they that testify of Me.” (
c. v. 39.) Shall we then say that He is inferior to the Prophets, because He draws testimonies
from them? Away with the thought. It is because of the infirmity of His hearers that He so
orders His discourse, and saith that He spake what He spake having heard it from the
Father, not because He needed a teacher, but that they might believe that nothing that He
said was false. John’s meaning is of this kind: “I desire to hear what He saith, for He cometh
from above, bringing thence those tidings which none but life knoweth rightly; for ‘what
He hath seen and heard,’ is the expression of one who declareth this.”</p>

<p>“And no man receiveth His testimony.” Yet He had disciples, and many besides gave
heed to His words. How then saith John, “No man”? He saith “no man,” instead of “few
men,” for had he meant “no man at all,” how could he have added,</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “He that hath received His testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.”</p>
<p>Here he touches his own disciples, as not being likely for a time to be firm believers.
And that they did not even after this believe in Him, is clear from what is said afterwards;
for John even when dwelling in prison sent them thence to Christ, that he might the more
bind them to Him. Yet even then they scarcely believed, to which Christ alluded when He
said, “And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me.” ( Matt. xi. 6 .) And therefore
now he said, “And no man receiveth His testimony,” to make sure his own disciples; all but
saying, “Do not, because for a time few shall believe on Him, therefore deem that His words
are false; for, ‘He speaketh that He hath seen.’” Moreover he saith this to touch also the insensibility
of the Jews. A charge which the Evangelist at commencing763 brought against
them, saying, “He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.” For this is no reproach
against Him, but an accusation of those who received Him not. ( c. i. 11.)</p>
<p>“He that hath received His testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.” Here he terrifies
them also by showing that he who believeth not on Him, disbelieveth not Him alone,
but the Father also; wherefore he adds:</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.”</p>
<p>Since then He speaketh His words, he that believeth and he that believeth not, believeth
or believeth not God. “Hath set to His seal,” that is, “hath declared.” Then, to increase their
dread, he saith, “that God is true;” thus showing, that no man could disbelieve Christ without
making God who sent Him guilty of a falsehood. Because, since He saith nothing save what
is from the Father, but all that He saith is His, he that heareth not Him, heareth not Him
that sent Him. See how by these words again he strikes them with fear. As yet they thought
it no great thing not to hearken to Christ; and therefore he held so great a danger above the
heads of the unbelievers, that they might learn that they hearken not to God Himself, who
hearken not to Christ. Then he proceeds with the discourse, descending to the measure of
their infirmity, and saying,</p>
<p>“For God giveth not the Spirit by measure.”</p>
<p>Again, as I said, he brings down his discourse to lower ground, varying it and making
it suitable to be received by those who heard it then; otherwise he could not have raised
them and increased their fear. For had he spoken anything great and sublime concerning
Jesus Himself, they would not have believed, but might even have despised Him. Therefore
he leads up all to the Father, speaking for a while of Christ as of a man. But what is it that
he saith, “God giveth not the Spirit by measure”? He would show that we all have received
<note type="footnote">763 or, “at the comm. of the Gospel.”</note>

<pb n="212"/>
the operation of the Spirit, by measure, (for in this place he means by “Spirit” the operation
of the Spirit, for this it is that is divided,) but that Christ hath all Its operation unmeasured
and entire. Now if His operations be unmeasured, much more His Essence. Seest thou too
that the Spirit is Infinite? How then can He who hath received all the operation of the Spirit,
who knoweth the things of God, who saith, “We speak that We have heard, and testify that
We have seen” ( c. iii. 11 ), be rightly suspected? He saith nothing which is not “of God,” or
which is not of “the Spirit.” And for a while he uttereth nothing concerning God the Word,764
but maketh all his doctrine credible by (reference to) the Father and the Spirit. For that there
is a God they knew, and that there is a Spirit they knew, (even though they held not a right
opinion concerning Him,) but that there is a Son, they knew not. It is for this reason that
he ever has recourse to the Father and the Spirit, thence confirming his words. For if any
one should take no account of this reason, and examine his language by itself, it 765 would
fall very far short of the Dignity of Christ. Christ was not therefore worthy of their faith,
because He had the operation of the Spirit, (for He needeth not aid from thence,) but is
Himself Self-sufficient; only for a while the Baptist speaks to the understanding of the simpler766
sort, desiring to raise them up by degrees from their low notions.</p>
<p>And this I say, that we may not carelessly pass by what is contained in the Scriptures,
but may fully consider the object of the speaker, and the infirmity of the hearers, and many
other points in them. For teachers do not say all as they themselves would wish, but generally
as the state of their weak (hearers) requires. Wherefore Paul saith, “I could not speak unto
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal; I have fed you with milk, and not with meat.” ( 1
Cor. iii. 1, 2.) He means, “I desired indeed to speak unto you as unto spiritual, but could
not”; not because he was unable, but because they were not able so to hear. So too John desired
to teach some great things to the disciples, but they could not yet bear to receive them,
and therefore he dwells for the most part on that which is lowlier.</p>
<p>It behooves us therefore to explore all carefully. For the words of the Scriptures are our
spiritual weapons; but if we know not how to fit those weapons and to arm our scholars
rightly, they keep indeed their proper power, but cannot help those who receive them. For
let us suppose there to be a strong corselet, and helm, and shield, and spear; and let one take
this armor and put the corselet upon his feet, the helmet over his eyes instead of on his head,
let him not put the shield before his breast, but perversely tie it to his legs: will he be able to
gain any advantage from the armor? will he not rather be harmed? It is plain to any one that
he will. Yet not on account of the weakness of the weapons, but on account of the unskillfulness
of the man who knows not how to use them well. So with the Scriptures, if we confound

<note type="footnote">766 ἀ τελεστέρων</note>

<pb n="213"/>
their order; they will even so retain their proper force, yet will do us no good. Although I
am always telling you this both in private and in public, I effect nothing, but see you all your
time nailed to the things of this life, and not so much as dreaming767 of spiritual matters.
Therefore our lives are careless, and we who strive for truth have but little power, and are
become a laughing stock to Greeks and Jews and Heretics. Had ye been careless in other
matters, and exhibited in this place the same indifference as elsewhere, not even so could
your doings have been defended; but now in matters of this life, every one of you, artisan
and politician alike, is keener than a sword, while in necessary and spiritual things we are
duller than any; making by-work business, and not deeming that which we ought to have
esteemed more pressing than any business, to be by-work even. Know ye not that the
Scriptures were written not for the first of mankind alone, but for our sakes also? Hearest
thou not Paul say, that “they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
world are come; that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope”?
( 1 Cor. x. 11; Rom. xv. 4 .) I know that I speak in vain, yet will I not cease to speak, for thus
I shall clear myself768 before God, though there be none to hear me. He that speaketh to
them that give heed hath this at least to cheer his speech, the persuasion of his hearers; but
he that speaks continually and is not listened to, and yet ceaseth not to speak, may be worthy
of greater honor than the other, because he fulfills the will of God, even though none give
heed unto him, to the best of his power. Still, though our reward will be greater owing to
your disobedience, we rather desire that it be diminished, and that your salvation be advanced,
thinking that your being well approved of769 is a great reward. And we now say this
not to make our discourse painful and burdensome to you, but to show to you the grief
which we feel by reason of your indifference. God grant that we may be all of us delivered
from this, that we may cling to spiritual zeal and obtain the blessings of heaven, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John iii. 35, 36</p>
<p>“The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the
Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath
of God abideth on him.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great is shown to be in all things the gain of humility.770 Thus it is that we have
brought arts to perfection, not by learning them all at once from our teachers; it is thus that
we have built cities, putting them together slowly, little by little; it is thus that we maintain771
our life. And marvel not if the thing has so much power in matters pertaining to this life,
when in spiritual things one may find that great is the power of this wisdom. For so the Jews
were enabled to be delivered from their idolatry, being led on gently and little by little, and
hearing from the first nothing sublime concerning either doctrine or life. So after the coming
of Christ, when it was the time for higher doctrines, the Apostles brought over all men
without at first uttering anything sublime. And so Christ appears to have spoken to most
at the beginning, and so John did now, speaking of Him as of some wonderful man, and
darkly introducing high matter.</p>
<p>For instance, when commencing he spake thus: “A man cannot receive anything of
himself”772 ( c. iii. 27 ): then after adding a high expression, and saying, “He that cometh
from heaven773 is above all,” he again brings down his discourse to what is lowly, and besides
many other things saith this, that “God giveth not the Spirit by measure.” Then he proceeds
to say, “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand.” And after that,
knowing that great is the force of punishment,774 and that the many are not so much led
by the promise of good things as by the threat of the terrible, he concludes his discourse
with these words; “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; but he that believeth
not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” Here again he refers
the account of punishment to the Father, for he saith not “the wrath of the Son,” (yet He is
the Judge,) but sets over them the Father, desiring so the more to terrify them.</p>
<p>“Is it then enough,” saith one, “to believe on the Son, that one may have eternal life?”
By no means. And hear Christ Himself declaring this, and saying, “Not every one that saith
unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven” ( Matt. vii. 21 ); and the blas-

<pb n="215"/>
phemy against the Spirit is enough of itself to cast a man into hell. But why speak I of a
portion of doctrine? Though a man believe rightly on the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, yet if he lead not a right life, his faith will avail nothing towards his salvation.
Therefore when He saith, “This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God”
( c. xvii. 3 ), let us not suppose that the (knowledge) spoken of is sufficient for our salvation;
we need besides this a most exact life and conversation. Since though he has said here, “He
that believeth on the Son hath eternal life,” and in the same place something even stronger,
(for he weaves his discourse not of blessings only, but of their contraries also, speaking thus:
“He that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him”;) yet
not even from this do we assert that faith alone is sufficient to salvation. And the directions
for living given in many places of the Gospels show this. Therefore he did not say, “This by
itself is eternal life,” nor, “He that doth but believe on the Son hath eternal life,” but by both
expressions he declared this, that the thing775 doth contain life, yet that if a right conversation
follow not, there will follow a heavy punishment. And he did not say, “awaiteth him,” but,
“abideth on him,” that is, “shall never remove from him.” For that thou mayest not think
that the “shall not see life,” is a temporary death, but mayest believe that the punishment is
continual, he hath put this expression to show that it rests776 upon him continually. And
this he has done, by these very words forcing them on777 to Christ. Therefore he gave not
the admonition to them in particular, but made it universal, the manner which best might
bring them over. For he did not say, “if ye believe,” and, “if ye believe not,” but made his
speech general, so that his words might be free from suspicion. And this he has done yet
more strongly than Christ. For Christ saith, “He that believeth not is condemned already,”
but John saith, “shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” With good cause;
for it was a different thing for a man to speak of himself and for another to speak of him.
They would have thought that Christ spake often of these things from self-love, and that he
was a boaster; but John was clear from all suspicion. And if at a later time, Christ also used
stronger expressions, it was when they had begun to conceive an exalted opinion of Him.</p>
<p>Chap. IV. Ver. 1, 2, 3. “When therefore Jesus778 knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, (though Jesus Himself baptized not but
His disciples,) He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.”</p>
<p>He indeed baptized not, but they who carried the news, desiring to excite their hearers
to envy, so reported. “Wherefore then ‘departed’ He?” Not from fear, but to take away779

their malice, and to soften their envy. He was indeed able to restrain them when they came
against Him, but this He would not do continually, that the Dispensation of the Flesh might
not be disbelieved. For had He often been seized and escaped, this would have been suspected
by many; therefore for the most part, He rather orders matters after the manner of a man.
And as He desired it to be believed that He was God, so also that, being God, He bore the
flesh; therefore even after the Resurrection, He said to the disciple, “Handle Me and see, for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones” ( Luke xxiv. 39 ); therefore also He rebuked Peter when
he said, “Be it far from Thee, this shall not be unto thee.” ( Matt. xvi. 22.) So much was this
matter an object of care to Him.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For this is no small part of the doctrines of the Church; it is the chief point of the
salvation wrought for us;780 by which all has been brought to pass, and has had success, for
it was thus that the bonds of death were loosed, sin taken away, and the curse abolished,
and ten thousand blessings introduced into our life. And therefore He especially desired
that the Dispensation should be believed, as having been the root and fountain of innumerable
goods to us.</p>
<p>Yet while acting thus in regard of His Humanity,781 He did not allow His Divinity to
be overcast. And so, after His departure He again employed the same language as before.
For He went not away into Galilee simply,782 but in order to effect certain important matters,
those among the Samaritans; nor did He dispense these matters simply, but with the wisdom
that belonged to783 Him, and so as not to leave to the Jews any pretense even of a shameless
excuse for themselves. And to this the Evangelist points when he says,</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “And He must needs go through Samaria.”</p>
<p>Showing that He made this the by-work of the journey. Which also the Apostles did;
for just as they, when persecuted by the Jews, came to the Gentiles; so also Christ, when the
Jews drove Him out, then took the Samaritans in hand, as He did also in the case of the
Syrophenician woman. And this was done that all defense might be cut away from the Jews,
and that they might not be able to say, “He left us, and went to the uncircumcised.” And
therefore the disciples excusing themselves said, “It was necessary that the Word of God
should first have been spoken unto you; but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.” ( Acts xiii. 46.) And He saith again Himself, “I am not
come784 but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel” ( Matt. xv. 24 ); and again, “It is not
meet to take the children’s bread, and to give785 it to dogs.” But when they drove Him away,

they opened a door to the Gentiles. Yet not so did He come to the Gentiles expressly, but
in passing.786 In passing then,</p>
<p>Ver. 5, 6. “He cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of
ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob’s well was there.”</p>
<p>Why is the Evangelist exact about the place? It is, that when thou hearest the woman
say, “Jacob our father gave us this well,” thou mayest not think it strange. For this was the
place where Levi and Simeon, being angry because of Dinah, wrought that cruel slaughter.
And it may be worth while to relate from what sources the Samaritans were made up; since
all this country is called Samaria. Whence then did they receive their name? The mountain
was called “Somor” from its owner ( 1 Kings xvi. 24 ): as also Esaias saith, “and the head of
Ephraim is Somoron” ( Isa. vii. 9 , LXX.), but the inhabitants were termed not “Samaritans”
but “Israelites.” But as time went on, they offended God, and in the reign of Pekah, Tiglath-
Pileser came up, and took many cities, and set upon Elah, and having slain him, gave the
kingdom to Hoshea.787 ( 2 Kings xv. 29.) Against him Shalmaneser came and took other
cities, and made them subject and tributary. ( 2 Kings xvii. 3.) At first he yielded, but afterwards
he revolted from the Assyrian rule, and betook himself to the alliance of the
Ethiopians.788 The Assyrian learnt this, and having made war upon them and destroyed
their cities, he no longer allowed the nation to remain there, because he had such suspicions
that they would revolt. ( 2 Kings xvii. 4.) But he carried them to Babylon and to the Medes,
and having brought thence nations from divers places, planted them in Samaria, that his
dominion for the future might be sure, his own people occupying the place. After this, God,
desiring to show that He had not given up the Jews through weakness, but because of the
sins of those who were given up, sent lions against the foreigners,789 who ravaged all their
nation. These things were reported to the king, and he sent a priest to deliver to them the
laws of God. Still not even so did they desist wholly from their impiety, but only by halves.
But as time went on, they in turn abandoned790 their idols, and worshiped God. And when
things were in this state, the Jews having returned, ever after entertained a jealous feeling
towards them as strangers and enemies, and called them from the name of the mountain,
“Samaritans.” From this cause also there was no little rivalry between them. The Samaritans
did not use all the Scriptures, but received the writings of Moses only, and made but little
account of those of the Prophets. Yet they were eager to thrust themselves into the noble
Jewish stock, and prided themselves upon Abraham, and called791 him their forefather, as
<note type="footnote">786 Morel. “having thus hinted that which he wished, he again begins, saying, Jesus therefore cometh,” U+0026c. </note>

being of Chaldæa; and Jacob also they called their father, as being his descendant. But the
Jews abominated them as well as all (other nations). Wherefore they reproached Christ with
this, saying, “Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil.” ( c. viii. 48.) And for this reason in the
parable of the man that went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, Christ makes the man who
showed pity upon him to have been “a Samaritan” ( Luke x. 33 ), one who by them was
deemed mean, contemptible, and abominable. And in the case of the ten lepers, He calls
one a “stranger” on this account, (for “he was a Samaritan,”) and He gave His charge to the
disciples in these words, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
Samaritans enter ye not.” ( Matt. x. 5.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Nor was it merely to describe the place that the Evangelist has reminded us of Jacob,
but to show that the rejection of the Jews had happened long ago. For during the time of
their forefathers these Jews possessed the land, and not the Samaritans; and the very possessions
which not being theirs, their forefathers had gotten, they being theirs, had lost by their
sloth and transgressions. So little792 is the advantage of excellent ancestors, if their descendants
be not like them. Moreover, the foreigners when they had only made trial of the lions,
straightway returned to the right worship793 of the Jews, while they, after enduring such
inflictions, were not even so brought to a sound mind.</p>
<p>To this place Christ now came, ever rejecting a sedentary and soft794 life, and exhibiting795
one laborious and active. He useth no beast to carry Him, but walketh so much on a
stretch, as even to be wearied with His journeying. And this He ever teacheth, that a man
should work for himself, go without superfluities, and not have many wants. Nay, so desirous
is He that we should be alienated from superfluities, that He abridgeth many even of necessary
things. Wherefore He said, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man hath not where to lay His head.” ( Matt. viii. 20.) Therefore He spent most of His
time in the mountains, and in the deserts, not by day only, but also by night. And this
David declared when he said, “He shall drink of the brook in the way” ( Ps. cx. 7 ): by this
showing His frugal796 way of life. This too the Evangelist shows in this place.</p>
<p>Ver. 6, 7, 8. “Jesus therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus by the well; and
it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith
unto her, Give Me to drink. For His disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat.”</p>
<p>Hence we learn His activity in journeying, His carelessness about food, and how He
treated it as a matter of minor importance.797 And so the disciples were taught to use the
<note type="footnote">792 al. “truly little.”</note>

<pb n="219"/>
like disposition themselves; for they took with them no provisions for the road. And this
another Evangelist declares, saying, that when He spake to them concerning “the leaven of
the Pharisees” ( Matt. xvi. 6 ), they thought that it was because they carried no bread; and
when he introduces them plucking the ears of corn, and eating ( Matt. xii. 1 ), and when he
saith that Jesus came to the fig-tree by reason of hunger ( Matt. xxi. 18 ), it is for nothing
else but only to instruct us by all these to despise the belly, and not to deem that its service
is anxiously to be attended to. Observe them, for instance, in this place neither bringing
anything with them, nor because they brought not anything, caring for this at the very beginning
and early part of the day, but buying food at the time when all other people were
taking their meal.798 Not like us, who the instant we rise from our beds attend to this before
anything else, calling cooks and butlers, and giving our directions with all earnestness, applying
ourselves afterwards to other matters, preferring temporal things to spiritual, valuing
those things as necessary which we ought to have deemed of less importance.799 Therefore
all things are in confusion. We ought, on the contrary, making much account of all spiritual
things, after having accomplished these, then to apply ourselves to the others.</p>
<p>And in this place it is not His laboriousness alone that is shown, but also His freedom
from pride; not merely by His being tired, nor by His sitting by the way-side, but by His
having been left alone, and His disciples having been separated800 from Him. And yet it
was in His power, if He had willed it, either not to have sent them all away, or when they
departed to have had other ministers. But He would not; for so He accustomed His disciples
to tread all pride beneath their feet.</p>
<p>“And what marvel,” saith one, “if they were moderate in their wishes, since they were
fishermen and tentmakers?” Yes! Fishermen and tentmakers they were; but they had in a
moment801 mounted even to the height of heaven, and had become more honorable than
all earthly kings, being deemed worthy to become the companions of the Lord of the world,
and to follow Him whom all beheld with awe. And ye know this too, that those men especially
who are of humble origin, whenever they gain distinction, are the more easily lifted up to
folly, because they are quite ignorant how to bear their sudden802 honor. Restraining them
therefore in their present humblemindedness, He taught them always to be moderate,803
and never to require any to wait upon them.</p>

<p>Seest thou that His sitting was because of weariness? because of the heat? because of his
waiting for His disciples? He knew, indeed, what should take place among the Samaritans,
but it was not for this that He came principally; yet, though He came not for this, it behooved
not to reject the woman who came to Him, when she manifested such a desire to learn. The
Jews, when He was even coming to them, drove Him away; they of the Gentiles, when He
was proceeding in another direction, drew Him to them. They envied, these believed on
Him. They were angry with, these revered and worshiped Him. What then? Was He to
overlook the salvation of so many, to send away such noble zeal? This would have been
unworthy of His lovingkindness. Therefore He ordered all the matter in hand with the
Wisdom which became Him. He sat resting His body and cooling It by the fountain; for it
was the very middle of the day, as the Evangelist has declared, when he says,</p>
<p>“It was about the sixth hour.”</p>
<p>He sat “thus.” What meaneth “thus”? Not upon a throne, not upon a cushion, but simply,
and as He was,806 upon the ground.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Observe how he declareth that the woman came forth for another purpose, in every
way silencing the shameless gainsaying of the Jews, that none might say that He acted in
opposition to His own command, bidding (His disciples) not to enter into any city of the
Samaritans, yet conversing with Samaritans. ( Matt. x. 5.) And therefore the Evangelist has
put,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “For His disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat.”807
Bringing in many reasons for His conversation with her. What doth the woman? When
she heard, “Give Me to drink,”808 she very wisely makes the speech of Christ an occasion
for a question, and saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Samaritan? For
the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.”</p>
<p>And whence did she suppose Him to be a Jew? From His dress, perhaps, and from His
dialect. Observe, I pray you, how considerate the woman was. If there was need of caution,
Jesus needed it, not she. For she doth not say, “The Samaritans have no dealings with the
<note type="footnote">804 ἐ κάθητο [ἐ καθέζετο] G. T.</note>

<pb n="221"/>
Jews,” but, “The Jews do not admit the Samaritans.” Yet still, although free herself from
blame,809 when she supposed that another was falling into it she would not even so hold
her peace, but corrected, as she thought, what was done unlawfully. Perhaps some one may
ask how it was that Jesus asked drink of her, when the law810 did not permit it. If it be
answered that it was because He knew beforehand that she would not give it, then for this
very reason He ought not to have asked. What then can we say? That the rejecting such
observances as these was now a matter of indifference to Him; for He who induced others
to do them away, would much more Himself pass them by. “Not that which goeth in,” saith
He, “defileth a man, but that which goeth out.” ( Matt. xv. 11 .) And this conversation with
the woman would be no slight charge against the Jews. For often did He draw them to
Himself, both by words and deeds, but they would not attend; while observe how she is detained
by a simple request.811 For He did not as yet enter on the prosecution of this business,
812 nor the way,813 yet if any came to Him He did not prevent them. And to the disciples
also He said thus, “Into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.” He did not say, “And when
they come to you, reject them”; that would have been very unworthy of His lovingkindness.
And therefore He answered the woman, and said,</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to
drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.”</p>
<p>First, He showeth that she is worthy to hear and not to be overlooked, and then He revealeth
Himself. For she, as soon as she had learnt who He was, would straightway hearken
and attend to Him; which none can say of the Jews, for they, when they had learned, asked
nothing of Him, nor did they desire to be informed on any profitable matter, but insulted
and drove Him away. But when the woman had heard these words, observe how gently she
answers:</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence then
hast thou that living water?”</p>
<p>Already He hath raised her from her low opinion of Him, and from deeming that He
is a common man. For not without a reason doth she here call Him, “Lord”;814 but assigning
to Him high honor. That she spake these words to honor Him, is plain from what is said
afterwards, since she did not laugh nor mock, but doubted for a while. And wonder not if
she did not at once perceive all, for neither did Nicodemus. What saith he? “How can these

<pb n="222"/>
things be?” and again, “How can a man be born when he is old?” and again, “Can he enter
the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?” But this woman more reverently:
“Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou that
living water?” Christ said one thing, and she imagined another, hearing nothing beyond the
words, and as yet unable to form any lofty thought. Yet, had she spoken hastily, she might
have said, “If thou hadst had that living water, thou wouldest not have asked of me, but
wouldest rather have provided for thyself. Thou art but a boaster.” But she said nothing like
this; she answers with much gentleness, both at first and afterwards. For at first she saith,
“How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me?” she saith not, as though speaking to
an alien and an enemy, “Far be it from me to give to thee, who art a foe and a stranger to
our nation.” And afterwards again, when she heard Him utter great words, a thing at which
enemies are most annoyed, she did not mock nor deride815 ; but what saith she?</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?”</p>
<p>Observe how she thrusts herself into the noble stock of the Jews. For what she saith is
somewhat of this kind: “Jacob used this water, and had nothing better to give us.” And this
she said showing that from the first answer (of Christ) she had conceived a great and sublime
thought; for by the words, “he drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle,” she
implies nothing else, than that she had a notion of a better Water, but that she 816 never
found it, nor clearly knew it. More clearly to explain what she means to say, the sense of her
words is this: “Thou canst not assert that Jacob gave us this well, and used another himself;
for he and his children drank of this one, which they would not have done if they had had
another and a better. Now of the water of this well it is not in thy power to give me, and
thou canst not have another and a better, unless thou dost confess that thou art greater than
Jacob. Whence then hast thou that water which thou promisest that thou wilt give us?” The
Jews did not converse with Him thus mildly, and yet He spake to them on the same subject,
making mention of the like water, but they profited nothing; and when He made mention
of Abraham, they even attempted to stone Him. Not so does this woman approach Him;
but with much gentleness, in the midst of the heat, at noon, she with much patience saith
and hears all, and does not so much as think of what the Jews most probably would have
asserted, that “This fellow is mad, and beside himself: he hath tied me to this fount and well,
giving me nothing, but using big words”; no, she endures and perseveres until she has found
what she seeks.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> If now a woman of Samaria is so earnest to learn something profitable, if she abides
by Christ though not as yet knowing Him, what pardon shall we obtain, who both knowing817
<note type="footnote">815 διέσυρε</note>
<note type="footnote">816 al. “not even he.”</note>
<note type="footnote">817 al. “having seen.”</note>

<pb n="223"/>
Him, and being not by a well, nor in a desert place, nor at noon-day, nor beneath the
scorching sunbeams, but at morning-tide, and beneath a roof like this, enjoying shade and
comfort,818 yet cannot endure to hear anything that is said, but are wearied819 by it. Not
such was that woman; so occupied was she by Jesus’ words, that she even called others to
hear them. The Jews, on the contrary, not only did not call, but even hindered and impeded
those who desired to come to Him,820 saying, “See, have any of the rulers believed on him?
but this people, which knoweth not the Law, are cursed.”821 Let us then imitate this woman
of Samaria; let us commune with Christ. For even now He standeth in the midst of us,
speaking to us by the Prophets and Disciples; let us hear and obey. How long shall we live
uselessly and in vain? Because, not to do what is well-pleasing to God is to live uselessly, or
rather not merely uselessly, but to our own hurt; for when we have spent the time which
has been given us on no good purpose, we shall depart this life to suffer severest punishment
for our unseasonable extravagance. For it can never be that a man who has received money
to trade with, and then has eaten it up, shall have it822 required at his hands by the man
who intrusted it to him; and that one who has spent such a life as ours to no purpose shall
escape punishment. It was not for this that God brought us into this present life, and breathed
into us a soul, that we should make use of the present time only,823 but that we should do
all our business with a regard to the life which is to come. Things irrational only are useful
for the present life; but we have an immortal soul, that we may use every means to prepare
ourselves for that other life. For if one enquire the use of horses and asses and oxen, and
other such-like animals, we shall tell him that it is nothing else but only to minister to the
present life; but this cannot be said of us; our best condition is that which follows on our
departure hence; and we must do all that we may shine there, that we may join the choir of
Angels, and stand before the King continually, through endless824 ages. And therefore the
soul is immortal, and the body shall be immortal too, that we may enjoy the never-ending
blessings. But if, when heavenly things are proffered thee, thou remainest nailed to earth,
consider what an insult is offered to thy Benefactor, when He holdeth forth to thee things
above, and thou, making no great account of them choosest earth instead. And therefore,
as despised by thee, He hath threatened thee with hell; that thou mayest learn hence of what
great blessings thou deprivest thyself. God grant that none make trial of that punishment,

<head>Homily XXXII.</head>
<p>John iv. 13, 14</p>
<p>“Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but
whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that
I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting Life.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Scripture calls the grace of the Spirit sometimes “Fire,” sometimes “Water,” showing
that these names are not descriptive of its essence, but of its operation; for the Spirit, being
Invisible and Simple, cannot be made up of different substances. Now the one John declares,
speaking thus, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire” ( Matt. iii. 11 ):
the other, Christ, “Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” ( John vii. 38.) “But this,”
saith John, “spake He of the Spirit, which they should receive.” So also conversing with the
woman, He calleth the Spirit water;825 for, “Whosoever shall drink of the water which I
shall give him, shall never thirst.” So also He calleth the Spirit by the name of “fire,” alluding
to the rousing and warming property of grace, and its power of destroying transgressions;
but by that of “water,” to declare the cleansing wrought by it, and the great refreshment
which it affordeth to those minds which receive it. And with good reason; for it makes the
willing soul like some 826 garden thick with all manner of trees fruitful and ever-flourishing,
allowing it neither to feel despondency nor the plots of Satan, and quenches827 all the fiery
darts of the wicked one.</p>
<p>And observe, I pray you, the wisdom of Christ,828 how gently He leads on829 the woman;
for He did not say at first, “If thou knewest who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to drink,”
but when He had given her an occasion of calling Him “a Jew,” and brought her beneath
the charge of having done so, repelling the accusation He saith, “If thou knewest who it is
that saith to thee, Give Me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him”; and having compelled
her by His great promises to make mention830 of the Patriarch, He thus alloweth the woman
to look through,831 and then when she objects, “Art thou greater than our father Jacob?”

<note type="footnote">826 al. “some flourishing.”</note>

<note type="footnote">831 or, “see clearly.”</note>

<pb n="226"/>
He saith not, “Yea, I am greater,” (for He would have seemed but to boast, since the proof
did not as yet appear,) but by what He saith He effecteth this. For He said not simply, “I will
give thee water,” but having first set that given by Jacob aside, He exalteth that given by
Himself, desiring to show from the nature of the things given, how great is the interval and
difference between the persons of the givers,832 and His own superiority to the Patriarch.
“If,” saith He, “thou admirest Jacob because he gave thee this water, what wilt thou say if I
give thee Water far better than this? Thou hast thyself been first to confess that I am greater
than Jacob, by arguing against Me, and asking, ‘Art thou greater than Jacob, that thou
promisest to give me better water?’ If thou receivest that Water, certainly thou wilt confess
that I am greater.” Seest thou the upright judgment of the woman, giving her decision from
facts, both as to the Patriarch, and as to Christ? The Jews acted not thus; when they even
saw Him casting out devils, they not only did not call Him greater than the Patriarch but
even said that He had a devil. Not so the woman, she draws her opinion whence Christ
would have her, from the demonstration afforded by His works. For by these He justifieth
Himself, saying, “If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not; but if I do, if ye believe
not Me, believe the works.” ( c. x. 37, 38.) And thus the woman is brought over to the faith.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He, having heard, “Art thou greater than our father Jacob,” leaveth
Jacob, and speaketh concerning the water, saying, “Whosoever shall drink of this water,
shall thirst again”; and He maketh His comparison, not by depreciating one, but by showing
the excellence of the other; for He saith not, that “this water is naught,” nor “that it is inferior
and contemptible,” but what even nature testifies that He saith: “Whosoever shall drink of
this water shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the Water which I shall give him,
shall never thirst.” The woman before this had heard of “living Water” ( v. 10 ), but had not
known its meaning. Since because that water is called “living” which is perennial and bubbles
up unceasingly from uninterrupted springs, she thought that this was the water meant.
Wherefore He points out this more clearly by speaking thus, and establishing by a comparison
the superiority (of the water which He would give). What then saith He? “Whosoever
shall drink of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst.” This and what was said
next especially showed the superiority, for material water possesses none of these qualities.
And what is it that follows? “It shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
life.” For as one that hath a well within him could never be seized by thirst, so neither can
he that hath this Water.</p>
<p>The woman straightway believed, showing herself much wiser than Nicodemus, and
not only wiser, but more manly. For he when he heard ten thousand such things neither
invited any others to this hearing, nor himself spake forth openly; but she exhibited the actions
of an Apostle, preaching the Gospel to all, and calling them to Jesus, and drawing a
<note type="footnote">832 al. “things given.”</note>

<pb n="227"/>
whole city forth to Him. Nicodemus when he had heard said, “How can these things be?”
And when Christ set before him a clear illustration, that of “the wind,” he did not even so
receive the Word. But the woman not so; at first she doubted, but afterwards receiving the
Word not by any regular demonstration, but in the form of an assertion, she straightway
hastened to embrace it. For when Christ said, “It shall be in him a well of water springing
up into everlasting Life,” immediately the woman saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “Give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how little by little she is led up to the highest doctrines? First she thought
Him some Jew who was transgressing the Law; then when He had repelled that accusation,
(for it was necessary that the person who was to teach833 her such things should not be
suspected,) having heard of “living water,” she supposed that this was spoken of material
water; afterwards, having learnt that the words were spiritual, she believed that the water
could remove the necessity caused by thirst, but knew not yet what this could be; she still
doubted, deeming it indeed to be above material things, but not being exactly informed.
But here having gained a clearer insight, but not yet fully perceiving the whole, (for she
saith, “Give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw,”) she for the time
preferreth Him to Jacob. “For” (saith she) “I need not this well if I receive from thee that
water.” Seest thou how she setteth Him before the Patriarch? This is the act of a fairlyjudging834
soul. She had shown how great an opinion she had of Jacob, she saw One better
than he, and was not held back by her prepossession. Thus this woman was neither of an
easy temper, (she did not carelessly receive what was said, how can she have done so when
she enquired with so great exactness?835) nor yet disobedient, nor disputatious, and this
she showed by her petition. Yet to the Jews once He said, “Whosoever shall eat of My flesh836
shall never hunger, and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst” ( c. vi. 35 ); but they not
only did not believe, but were offended at Him. The woman had no such feeling, she remains
and petitions. To the Jews He said, “He that believeth on Me shall never thirst”; not so to
the woman, but more grossly, “He that drinketh of this Water shall never thirst.” For the
promise referred to spiritual and unseen837 things. Wherefore having raised her mind by
His promises, He still lingers among expressions relating to sense, because she could not as
yet comprehend the exact expression of spiritual things. Since had He said, “If thou believest
in Me thou shalt not thirst,” she would not have understood His saying, not knowing who
it could be that spake to her, nor concerning what kind of thirst He spake. Wherefore then

<note type="footnote">836 ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρός με, G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">837 al. “not finite.”</note>

<pb n="228"/>
did He not this in the case of the Jews? Because they had seen many signs, while she had
seen no sign, but heard these words first. For which reason He afterwards reveals His power
by prophecy, and does not directly introduce His reproof,838 but what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 16–19. “Go, call thy husband, and come thither. The woman answered and said I
have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: for thou hast
had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
The woman saith unto Him, Sir, I perceive that Thou art a Prophet.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> O how great the wisdom of the woman! how meekly doth she receive the reproof!
“How should she not,” saith some one? Tell me, why should she? Did He not often reprove
the Jews also, and with greater reproofs than these? (for it is not the same to bring forward
the hidden thoughts of the heart, as to make manifest a thing that was done in secret; the
first are known to839 God alone, and none other knoweth them but he who hath them in
his heart; the second, all who were sharers in it know;) but still when reproved did not bear
it patiently. When He said, “Why seek ye to kill me?” ( c. vii. 19 ), they not only did not admire
as the woman did but even mocked at and insulted Him; yet they had a demonstration
from other miracles, she had only heard this speech. Still they not only did not admire, but
even insulted Him, saying, “Thou hast a demon, who seeketh to kill thee?” While she not
only doth not insult but admires, and is astonished at Him, and supposes Him to be a
Prophet. Yet truly this rebuke touched the woman more than the other touched them; for
her fault was hers alone, theirs was a general one; and we are not so much stung by what is
general as by what is particular. Besides they thought they should be gaining a great object
if they could slay Christ, but that which the woman had done was allowed by all to be wicked;
yet was she not indignant, but was astonished and wondered. And Christ did this very same
thing in the case of Nathanael. He did not at first introduce the prophecy, nor say, “I saw
thee under the fig-tree,” but when Nathanael said, “Whence knowest thou me?” then He
introduced this. For He desired to take the beginnings of His signs and prophecies from the
very persons who came near to Him, so that they might be more attached840 by what was
done, and He might escape the suspicion of vainglory. Now this He doth here also; for to
have charged her first of all that, “Thou hast no husband,” would have seemed burdensome
and superfluous, but to take the reason (for speaking) from herself, and then to set right all
these points, was very consistent, and softened the disposition of the hearer.
“And what kind of connection,” saith some one, “is there in the saying, ‘Go, call thy
husband’?” The discourse was concerning a gift and grace surpassing mortal nature: the
woman was urgent in seeking to receive it. Christ saith, “Call thy husband,” showing that
<note type="footnote">838 ἔ λεγχον</note>
<note type="footnote">839 or, “is the work of.”</note>
<note type="footnote">840 οἰκειοῦσθαι</note>

<pb n="229"/>
he also must share in these things; but she, eager to receive841 (the gift), and concealing the
shamefulness of the circumstances, and supposing that she was conversing with a man, said,
“I have no husband.” Christ having heard this, now seasonably introduces His reproof,
mentioning accurately both points; for He enumerated all her former husbands, and reproved
her for him whom842 she now would hide. What then did the woman? she was not annoyed,
nor did she leave Him and fly, nor deem the thing an insult, but rather admired Him, and
persevered the more. “I perceive,” saith she, “that Thou art a Prophet.” Observe her prudence;
she did not straightway run to Him, but still considers Him, and marvels at Him. For, “I
perceive,” means, “Thou appearest to me to be a Prophet.” Then when she suspected this,
she asks Him nothing concerning this life, not concerning bodily health, or possessions, or
wealth, but at once concerning doctrines. For what saith she?</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “Our fathers worshiped in this mountain,” (meaning Abraham and his family,
for thither they say that he led up his son,) “and how say ye843 that in Jerusalem is the place
where men ought to worship?”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Seest thou how much more elevated in mind she has become? She who was anxious
that she might not be troubled for thirst, now questions concerning doctrines. What then
doth Christ? He doth not resolve the question, (for to answer simply to men’s words was
not His care, for it was needless,844) but leads the woman on to the greater height, and doth
not converse with her on these matters, until she has confessed that He was a Prophet, so
that afterwards she might hear His Word with abundant belief; for having been persuaded
of this, she could no longer doubt concerning what should be said to her.</p>
<p>Let us now after this be ashamed, and blush. A woman who had had five husbands, and
who was of Samaria, was so eager concerning doctrines, that neither the time of day, nor
her having come for another purpose, nor anything else, led her away from enquiring on
such matters; but we not only do not enquire concerning doctrines, but towards them all
our dispositions are careless and indifferent. Therefore everything is neglected. For which
of you when in his house takes some Christian book845 in hand and goes over its contents,
and searches the Scriptures? None can say that he does so, but with most we shall find
draughts and dice, but books nowhere, except among a few. And even these few have the
same dispositions as the many; for they tie up their books, and keep them always put away
in cases, and all their care is for the fineness of the parchments, and the beauty of the letters,
not for reading them. For they have not bought them to obtain advantage and benefit from
<note type="footnote">841 al. “to be hidden.”</note>
<note type="footnote">842 al. “the thing which.”</note>
<note type="footnote">843 καὶ ὑμ. λέγετε, G. T.</note>

<pb n="230"/>
them, but take pains about such matters to show their wealth and pride. Such is the excess
of vainglory. I do not hear any one glory that he knows the contents, but that he hath a book
written in letters of gold. And what gain, tell me, is this? The Scriptures were not given us
for this only, that we might have them in books, but that we might engrave them on our
hearts. For this kind of possession, the keeping the commandments merely in letter, belongs
to Jewish ambition; but to us the Law was not so given846 at all, but in the fleshy tables of
our hearts.847 And this I say, not to prevent you from procuring Bibles, on the contrary, I
exhort and earnestly pray that you do this, but I desire that from those books you convey
the letters and sense into your understanding, that so it may be purified when it receiveth
the meaning of the writing.848 For if the devil will not dare to approach a house where a
Gospel is lying, much less will any evil spirit, or any sinful nature,849 ever touch or enter a
soul which bears about with it such sentiments as it contains. Sanctify then thy soul, sanctify
thy body, by having these ever in thy heart, and on thy tongue. For if foul speech defiles and
invites devils, it is clear that spiritual reading sanctifies and draws down the grace of the
Spirit. The Scriptures850 are divine charms, let us then apply to ourselves and851 to the
passions of our souls the remedies to be derived from them. For if we understand what it is
that is read, we shall hear it with much readiness. I am always saying this, and will not cease
to say it. Is it not strange that those who sit by the market can tell the names, and families,
and cities of charioteers, and dancers, and the kinds of power possessed by each, and can
give exact account of the good or bad qualities of the very horses, but that those who come
hither should know nothing of what is done here, but should be ignorant of the number
even of the sacred Books? If thou pursuest those worldly things for pleasure, I will show
thee that here is greater pleasure. Which is sweeter, tell me, which more marvelous, to see
a man wrestling with a man, or a man buffering with a devil, a body closing with an incorporeal

and the Lord of Archangels. Say now, if thou wert allowed to sit with governors and kings,
and to see and enjoy the spectacle, wouldest thou not deem it to be a very great honor? And

here when thou art a spectator in company with the King of Angels, when thou seest the
devil grasped by the middle of the back,853 striving much to have the better, but powerless,
dost thou not run and pursue after such a sight as this? “And how can this be?” saith some
one. If thou keep the Bible in thy hands; for in it thou shalt see the lists, and the long races,
and his grasps,854 and the skill of the righteous one. For by beholding these things thou
shalt learn also how to wrestle so thyself, and shalt escape clear of devils; the performances
of the heathen are assemblies of devils, not theaters of men. Wherefore I exhort you to abstain
from these Satanic assemblies;855 for if it is not lawful to enter into an idol’s house, much
less to Satan’s festival. I shall not cease to say these things and weary you, until I see some
change; for to say these things, as saith Paul, “to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is
safe.” ( Phil. iii. 1.) Be not then offended at my exhortation. If any one ought to be offended,
it is I who often speak and am not heard, not you who are always hearing and always disobeying.
God grant that you be not always liable to this charge, but that freed from this
shame you be deemed worthy to enjoy the spiritual spectacle,856 and the glory which is to
come, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John iv. 21, 22</p>
<p>“Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe Me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what; we
know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Everywhere, beloved, we have need of faith, faith the mother of blessings, the
medicine of salvation; and without this it is impossible to possess any one of the great doctrines.
Without this, men are like to those who attempt to cross857 the open sea without a
ship, who for a little way hold out by swimming, using both hands and feet, but when they
have advanced farther, are quickly swamped by the waves: in like manner they who use their
own reasonings, before they have learnt anything, suffer shipwreck; as also Paul saith, “Who
concerning faith have made shipwreck.” ( 1 Tim. i. 19.) That this be not our case, let us hold
fast the sacred anchor by which Christ bringeth over the Samaritan woman now. For when
she had said, “How say ye858 that Jerusalem is the place in which men ought to worship?”
Christ replied, “Believe Me, woman, that the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in Jerusalem,
nor yet in this mountain, worship the Father.” An exceedingly great859 doctrine He revealed
to her, and one which He did not mention either to Nicodemus or Nathanael. She was eager
to prove her own privileges more honorable than those of the Jews; and this she subtly argued
from the Fathers, but Christ met not this question. For it was for the time distracting860 to
speak on the matter, and to show why the Fathers worshiped in the mountain, and why the
Jews at Jerusalem. Wherefore on this point He was silent, and having taken away from both
places priority in dignity, rouses her soul by showing that neither Jews nor Samaritans
possessed anything great in comparison with that which was to be given; and then He introduceth
the difference. Yet even thus He declared that the Jews were more honorable, not
preferring place to place, but giving them the precedence because of their intention. As
though He had said, “About the ‘place’ of worship ye have no need henceforth to dispute,
but in the ‘manner’ the Jews have an advantage over you Samaritans, for ‘ye,’ He saith,
‘worship ye know not what; we know what we worship.’”</p>
<p>How then did the Samaritans “know not” what they worshiped? Because they thought
that God was local and partial; so at least they served Him, and so they sent to the Persians,
and reported that “the God of this place is wroth with us” ( 2 Kings xxvi.), in this respect
<note type="footnote">857 διαβαλεῖν, al. διαλαβεῖν, al. διαπερᾶν</note>

<pb n="233"/>
forming no higher opinion of Him than of their idols. Wherefore they continued to serve
both Him and devils, joining things which ought not to be joined. The Jews, on the contrary,
were free from this supposition, at least the greater part of them, and knew that He was God
of the world. Therefore He saith, “Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship.”
Do not wonder that He numbereth Himself among Jews, for He speaketh to the woman’s
opinion of Him as though He were a Jewish Prophet, and therefore He putteth, “we worship.”
For that He is of the objects of worship is clear to every one, because to worship belongs to
the creature, but to be worshiped to the Lord of the creature. But for a time He speaketh as
a Jew; and the expression “we” in this place meaneth “we Jews.” Having then exalted what
was Jewish, He next maketh Himself credible, and persuadeth the woman to give the
greater heed to His words, by rendering His discourse above suspicion, and showing that
He doth not exalt what belongs to them by reason of relationship861 to those of His own
tribe. For it is clear, that one who had made these declarations concerning the place on
which the Jews most prided themselves, and thought that they were superior to all, and who
had taken away their high claims, would not after this862 speak to get favor of any, but with
truth and prophetic power. When therefore He had for a while removed her from such
reasonings,863 say ing, “Woman, believe Me,” and what follows, then He addeth, “for salvation
is of the Jews.” What He saith is of this kind: neither, that blessings to the world came
from them, (for to know God and condemn idols had its beginning from them, and with
you the very act of worship, although ye do it not rightly, yet received its origin from them,)
or else, He speaketh of His own Coming. Or rather, one would not be wrong in calling both
these things “salvation” which He said was “of the Jews”; which Paul implied when he said,
“Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all.” ( Rom. ix. 5.) Seest thou
how He commendeth864 the old Covenant, and showeth that it is the root of blessings, and
that He is throughout not opposed to the Law, since He maketh the groundwork865 of all
good things to come from the Jews?</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the
Father.”</p>
<p>“We, O woman,” He saith, “excel you in the manner of our worship, but even this shall
henceforth have an end. Not the places only, but even the manner of serving God shall be
changed. And this change is at your very doors. ‘For the hour cometh, and now is.’”</p>

<p><del>2.</del> For since what the Prophets said they said long before the event, to show that here
it is not so,866 He saith, “And now is.” Think not, He saith, that this is a prophecy of such
a kind as shall be accomplished after a long time, the fulfillment is already at hand and at
your very doors, “when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.”
In saying “true,”867 He excludeth Jews as well as Samaritans; for although the Jews be better
than the Samaritans, yet are they far inferior to those that shall come, as inferior as is the
type to the reality. But He speaketh of the Church, that she868 is the “true” worship, and
such as is meet for God.</p>
<p>“For the Father seeketh such to worship Him.”</p>
<p>If then He in times past sought such as these, He allowed to those others their way of
worship, not willingly,869 but from condescension, and for this reason,870 that He might
bring them in also. Who then are “the true worshipers”? Those who confine not their service
by place, and who serve God in spirit; as Paul saith, “Whom I serve in my spirit871 in the
Gospel of His Son”: and again, “I beseech you that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
acceptable unto God, your reasonable service.” ( Rom. i. 9 and xii. 1.) But when he saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “God is a Spirit” [God is spirit]. He declareth nothing else than His incorporeal
Nature. Now the service of that which is incorporeal must needs be of the same character,
and must be offered by that in us which is incorporeal, to wit, the soul, and purity of mind.
Wherefore He saith, “they that worship Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” For
because both Samaritans and Jews were careless about the soul, but took great pains about
the body, cleansing it in divers ways, it is not, He saith, by purity of body, but by that which
is incorporeal in us, namely the mind, that the incorporeal One is served. Sacrifice then not
sheep and calves, but dedicate thyself to the Lord; make thyself a holocaust, this is to offer
a living sacrifice. Ye must worship “in truth”872 ; as former things were types, such as circumcision,
and whole burnt offerings, and victims, and incense, they now no longer exist,
but all is “truth.” For a man must now circumcise not his flesh, but his evil thoughts, and
crucify himself, and remove and slay his unreasonable desires.” The woman was made dizzy
by His discourse, and fainted873 in at the sublimity of what He said, and, in her trouble,

<p>Ver. 25, 26. “I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when He is come, He
will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I am that speak unto thee.”</p>
<p>And whence came the Samaritans to expect the coming of Christ, seeing that they received
Moses only?874 From the writings of Moses themselves. For even in the beginning
He revealed the Son. “Let Us make man in Our Image, after Our Likeness” ( Gen. i. 26 ),
was said to the Son. It was He who talked with Abraham in the tent. ( Gen. xviii.) And Jacob
prophesying concerning Him said, “A ruler shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his
thighs, until He come for whom it is reserved, 875 and He is the expectation of nations.” (
Gen. xviii.) And Moses himself saith, “The Lord thy God will raise up unto you a Prophet
of your brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye hearken.” ( Deut. xviii. 15.) And the circumstances
attending the serpent, and the rod of Moses, and Isaac, and the sheep, and many
other things they who chose might select as proclaiming His coming.</p>
<p>“And why, pray,” saith one, “did not Christ lead on the woman by these means? why
did He instance the serpent to Nicodemus, and mention prophecy to Nathanael, but to her
say nothing of the kind? For what reason, and why?” Because they were men, and were
versed in these things, she a poor ignorant woman unpracticed in the Scriptures. Wherefore
He doth not speak to her from them, but draweth her on by the “water” and by prophecy,
and bringeth her to make mention of Christ and then revealeth Himself; which had He at
first told the woman when she had not questioned Him, He would have seemed to her to
trifle and talk idly, while as it is by bringing her little by little to mention Him, at a fitting
time He revealed Himself. To the Jews, who continually said, “How long dost Thou make
us to doubt? tell us if Thou art the Christ” ( c. x. 24 ), to them876 He gave no clear answer,
but to this woman He said plainly, that He is. For the woman was more fair-minded than
the Jews; they did not enquire to learn, but always to mock at Him, for had they desired to
learn, the teaching which was by His words, and by the Scriptures, and by His miracles
would have been sufficient. The woman, on the contrary, said what she said from an impartial
judgment and a simple mind, as is plain from what she did afterwards; for she both heard
and believed, and netted877 others also, and in every circumstance we may observe the
carefulness and faith of the woman.</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “And upon this came His disciples,” (very seasonably did they come when the
teaching was finished,) “and marveled that He talked with the woman, yet no man said,
What seekest Thou? or, Why talkest Thou with her?”</p>

<p><del>3.</del> At what did they marvel? At His want of pride and exceeding humility, that looked
upon as He was, He endured with such lowliness of heart to talk with a woman poor, and
a Samaritan. Still in their amazement they did not ask Him the reason, so well were they
taught to keep the station of disciples, so much did they fear and reverence Him. For although
they did not as yet hold the right opinion concerning Him, still they gave heed unto Him
as to some marvelous one, and paid Him much respect. Yet they frequently are seen to act
confidently; as when John lay upon His bosom, when they came to Him and said, “Who is
the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” ( Matt. xviii. 1 ), when the sons of Zebedee entreated
Him to set one of them on His right hand, and the other on His left. Why then did they not
here question Him? Because since all those instances related to themselves, they had need
to enquire into them, while what here took place was of no such great importance to them.
And indeed John did that a long time after towards the very end, when He enjoyed greater
confidence, and was bold in the love of Christ; for he it was,878 he saith, “whom Jesus loved.”
What could equal such blessedness?</p>
<p>But, beloved, let us not stop at this, the calling the Apostle blessed, but let us do all things
that we also may be of the blessed, let us imitate the Evangelist, and see what it was that
caused such great love. What then was it? He left his father, his ship, and his net, and followed
Jesus. Yet this he did in common with his brother, and Peter, and Andrew, and the rest of
the Apostles. What then was the special879 thing which caused this great love? Shall we
discover it? He saith nothing of this kind about himself, but only that he was beloved; as to
the righteous acts for which he was beloved he has modestly been silent. That Jesus loved
him with an especial love was clear to every one; yet John doth not appear conversing with
or questioning Jesus privately, as Peter often did, and Philip, and Judas, and Thomas, except
only when he desired to show kindness and compliance to his fellow Apostle; for when the
chief880 of the Apostles by beckoning constrained him, then he asked. For these two had
great love each for the other. Thus, for instance, they are seen going up together into the
Temple and speaking in common to the people. Yet Peter in many places881 is moved, and
speaks more warmly than John. And at the end he hears Christ say, “Peter,882 lovest thou
Me more than these?” ( c. xxi. 15.) Now it is clear that he who loved “more than these” was
also beloved. But this in his case was shown by loving Jesus, in the case of the other by being
beloved by Jesus.883</p>

<note type="footnote">883 i.e. St. Peter loved his Lord, and therefore we infer that he was loved of Him; of St. John Scripture speaks
expressly, as being “the Disciple whom Jesus loved.”</note>

<pb n="237"/>
<p>What then was it which caused this especial love? To my thinking, it was that the man
displayed great gentleness and meekness, for which reason he doth not appear in many
places speaking openly. And how great a thing this is, is plain also from the case of Moses.
It was this which made him such and so great as he was. There is nothing equal to lowliness
of mind. For which cause Jesus with this began the Beatitudes, and when about to lay as it
were the foundation and base of a mighty building, He placed first lowliness of mind. Without
this a man cannot possibly be saved; though he fast, though he pray, though he give alms,
if it be with a proud spirit, these884 things are abominable, if humility be not there; while if
it be, all these things are amiable and lovely, and are done with safety. Let us then be modest,
885 beloved, let us be modest; success is easy, if we be sober-minded. For after all what
is it, O man, that exciteth thee to pride? Seest thou not the poverty of thy nature? the unsteadiness886
of thy will? Consider thine end, consider the multitude of thy sins. But perhaps
because thou doest many righteous deeds thou art proud. By that very pride thou shalt undo
them all. Wherefore it behoveth not so much him that has sinned887 as him that doeth
righteousness to take pains to be humble. Why so? Because the sinner is constrained by
conscience, while the other, except he be very sober, soon caught up as by a blast of wind is
lifted on high, and made to vanish like the Pharisee. Dost thou give to the poor? What thou
givest is not thine, but thy Master’s, common to thee and thy fellow-servants. For which
cause thou oughtest especially to be humbled, in the calamities of those who are thy kindred
foreseeing thine own, and taking knowledge of thine own nature in their cases. We ourselves
perhaps are sprung from such ancestors; and if wealth has shifted to you, it is probable that
it will leave you again. And after all, what is wealth? A vain888 shadow, dissolving smoke, a
flower of the grass, or rather something meaner than a flower. Why then art thou highminded
over grass? Doth not wealth fall to thieves, and effeminates, and harlots, and tombbreakers?
Doth this puff thee up, that thou hast such as these to share in thy possession? or
dost thou desire honor? Towards gaining honor nothing is more serviceable than almsgiving.
For the honors arising from wealth and power are compulsory, and attended with hatred,
but these others are from the free will and real feeling of the honorers; and therefore those
who pay them can never give them. Now if men show such reverence for the merciful, and
invoke all blessings upon them, consider what return, what recompense they shall receive
from the merciful God. Let us then seek this wealth which endureth forever, and never
deserts889 us, that, becoming great here and glorious there, we may obtain everlasting

<p>John iv. 28, 29</p>
<p>“The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
Come, see a Man which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Christ?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> We require much fervor and uproused zeal, for without these it is impossible to
obtain the blessings promised to us. And to show this, Christ at one time saith, “Except a
man take890 up his cross and follow Me, he is not worthy of Me” ( Matt. x. 38 ); at another,
“I am come to send fire upon the earth, and what will I if it be already kindled?” ( Luke xii.
49 ); by both these desiring to represent to us a disciple full of heat and fire, and prepared
for every danger. Such an one was this woman. For so kindled was she by His words, that
she left her water pot and the purpose for which she came, ran into the city, and drew all
the people to Jesus. “Come,” she saith, “see a Man which told me all things that ever I did.”</p>
<p>Observe her zeal and wisdom. She came to draw water, and when she had lighted upon
the true Well, she after that despised the material one; teaching us even by this trifling instance
when we are listening to spiritual matters to overlook the things of this life, and make
no account of them. For what the Apostles did, that, after her ability, did this woman also.891
They when they were called, left their nets; she of her own accord, without the command
of any, leaves her water pot, and winged by joy892 performs the office of Evangelists. And
she calls not one or two, as did Andrew and Philip, but having aroused a whole city and
people, so brought them to Him.</p>
<p>Observe too how prudently she speaks; she said not, “Come and see the Christ,” but
with the same condescension893 by which Christ had netted her she draws the men to Him;
“Come,” she saith, “see a Man who told me all that ever I did.” She was not ashamed to say
that He “told me all that ever I did.” Yet she might have spoken otherwise, “Come, see one
that prophesieth”; but when the soul is inflamed with holy fire, it looks then to nothing
earthly, neither to glory nor to shame, but belongs to one thing alone, the flame which occupieth
it.</p>
<p>“Is not this the Christ?” Observe again here the great wisdom of the woman; she neither
declared the fact plainly, nor was she silent, for she desired not to bring them in by her own
assertion, but to make them to share in this opinion by hearing Him; which rendered her
words more readily acceptable to them. Yet He had not told all her life to her, only from
<note type="footnote">890 ὃ ς οὐ λαμβάνει κ.τ.λ. G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">891 Ben. “in a higher degree.”</note>
<note type="footnote">892 al. “by grace.”</note>
<note type="footnote">893 i.e. to their infirmity.</note>

<pb n="240"/>
what had been said she was persuaded (that He was informed) as to the rest. Nor did she
say, “Come, believe,” but, “Come, see”; a gentler894 expression than the other, and one which
more attracted them. Seest thou the wisdom of the woman? She knew, she knew certainly
that having but tasted that Well, they would be affected in the same manner as herself. Yet
any one of the grosser sort would have concealed the reproof which Jesus had given; but
she parades her own life, and brings it forward before all men, so as to attract and capture
all.</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “In the mean time His disciples asked895 Him, saying, Master, eat.” “Asked,”
here is “besought,” in their native language; for seeing Him wearied with the journey, and
the oppressive heat, they entreated Him; for their request concerning food proceeded not
from hastiness, but from loving affection for their Teacher? What then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 32, 33. “I have meat to eat that ye know not of. Therefore” (saith the Evangelist)
“said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought Him aught to eat?”</p>
<p>Why now wonderest thou that the woman when she heard of “water,” still imagined
mere water to be meant, when even the disciples are in the same case, and as yet suppose
nothing spiritual, but are perplexed? though they still show their accustomed modesty and
reverence toward their Master, conversing one with the other, but not daring to put any
question to Him. And this they do in other places, desiring to ask Him, but not asking. What
then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.”</p>
<p>He here calleth the salvation of men “meat,” showing what an earnest desire He hath
of providing for us;896 for as we long for food, so He that we may be saved. And hear how
in all places He revealeth not all off-hand, but first throweth the hearer into perplexity, in
order that having begun to seek the meaning of what has been said, and then being perplexed
and in difficulty, he may when what he sought appears, receive it the more readily, and be
made more attentive to listening. For wherefore said He not at once, “My meat is to do the
will of My Father?” (though not even this would have been clear, yet clearer than the other.)
But what saith He? “I have meat to eat that ye know not of”; for He desireth, as I said, first
to make them more attentive through their uncertainty, and by dark sayings like these to
accustom them to listen to His words. But what is “the will of the Father”? He next speaketh
of this, and explaineth.</p>

<p>Ver. 35. “Say ye not, that there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold,
I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the fields, for they are white already to
harvest.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Behold, He again by familiar words leadeth them up to the consideration of greater
matters; for when He spoke of “meat,” He signified nothing else than the salvation of the
men who should come to Him; and again, the “field” and the “harvest” signify the very same
thing, the multitude of souls prepared for the reception of the preaching; and the “eyes” of
which He speaketh are those both of the mind and of the body; (for they now beheld the
crowd of Samaritans advancing;) and the readiness of their will He calleth, “fields already
white.” For as the ears of corn, when they have become white, and are ready for reaping, so
these, He saith, are prepared and fitted for salvation.</p>
<p>And wherefore instead of calling them “fields” and “harvest,” did He not plainly say,
that “the men were coming to believe and were ready to receive the Word, having been instructed
by the Prophets; and now bringing forth fruit”? What mean these figures used by
Him? for this He doth not here only, but through all the Gospel; and the Prophets also employ
the same method, saying many things in a metaphorical manner. What then may be the
cause of this? for the grace of the Spirit did not ordain it to be so without a reason, but why
and wherefore? On two accounts; one, that the discourse may be more vivid, and bring what
is said more clearly before our eyes. For the mind when it has laid hold on a familiar image
of the matters in hand, is more aroused, and beholding them as it were in a picture, is occupied
by them to a greater degree. This is one reason; the other is, that the statement may be
sweetened, and that the memory of what is said may be more lasting. For assertion does not
subdue and bring in an ordinary hearer so much as narration by objects, and the representation
of experience.897 Which one may here see most wisely effected by the parable.</p>
<p>Ver. 36. “And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal.”</p>
<p>For the fruit of an earthly harvest profiteth not to life eternal, but to this which is for a
time; but the spiritual fruit to that which hath neither age nor death. Seest thou that the expressions
are of sense, but the thoughts spiritual, and that by the very words themselves He
divideth things earthly from heavenly? For when in discoursing of water He made this the
peculiar property of the heavenly Water, that “he who drinketh it shall never thirst,” so He
doth here also when He saith, “that this fruit is gathered unto eternal life.”</p>
<p>“That both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.”</p>
<p>Who is “he that soweth”? Who “he that reapeth”? The Prophets are they that sowed but
they reaped not, but the Apostles. “Yet not on this account are they deprived of the pleasure
and recompense of their labors, but they rejoice and are glad with us, although they reap
not with us. For harvest is not such work as sowing. I therefore have kept you for that in
<note type="footnote">897 i.e. given by means of things which are objects of experience. ὑ πογραφὴ πείρας, al. πείρα</note>

<pb n="242"/>
which the toil is less and the pleasure greater, and not for sowing because in that there is
much hardship and toil. In harvest the return is large, the labor not so great; nay there is
much facility.”898 By these arguments He here desireth to prove, that “the wish of the
Prophets is, that all men should come to Me.” This also the Law was engaged in effecting;
and for this they sowed, that they might produce this fruit.899 He showeth moreover that
He sent them also, and that there was a very intimate connection between the New Covenant
and the Old, and all this He effecteth at once by this parable. He maketh mention also of a
proverbial expression generally circulated.</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “Herein,” He saith, “is that saying true, One soweth and another reapeth.”</p>
<p>These words the many used whenever one party had supplied toil and another had
reaped the fruits; and He saith, “that the proverb is in this instance especially true, for the
Prophets labored, and ye reap the fruits of their labors.” He said not “the rewards,” (for
neither did their great labor go unrewarded,) but “the fruits.” This also Daniel did, for he
too makes mention of a proverb, “Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked”; and David in
his lamenting makes mention of a similar proverb.900 Therefore He said beforehand, “that
both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.” For since He was about to
declare, that “one hath sowed and another reapeth,” lest any one should deem that the
Prophets were deprived of their reward, He asserteth something strange and paradoxical,
such as never chanceth in sensual things, but is peculiar to spiritual only. For in things of
sense, if it chance that one sow and another reap, they do not “rejoice together,” but those
who sowed are sad, as having labored for others, and those who reap alone rejoice. But here
it is not so, but those who reap not what they sowed rejoice alike with those who reap;
whence it is clear that they too share the reward.</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labors; other men labored,
and ye are entered into their labors.”</p>
<p>By this He the more encourageth them; for when it seemed a very hard matter to go
through all the world and preach the Gospel, He showeth them that it is even most901 easy.
The very difficult work was that other, which required great labor, the putting in the seed,
and introducing the uninitiated soul to the knowledge of God. But wherefore uttereth He
these sayings? It is that when He sendeth them to preach they may not be confounded, as
<note type="footnote">898 εὐκολία, al. ῥ αστώνη</note>
<note type="footnote">899 al. “by this.”</note>
<note type="footnote">900 There is no authority for a different reading, but it seems to be rightly conjectured by Savile and Ben. that
the names “Daniel” and “David” should be transposed. The proverb is that used by David, 1 Sam. xxiv. 13 , and

though sent on a difficult task. “For that of the Prophets,” He saith, “was the more difficult,
and the fact witnesseth to My word, that ye are come to what is easy; because as in harvest
time the fruits are collected with ease, and in one moment the floor is filled with sheaves,
which await902 not the revolutions of the seasons, and winter, and spring, and rain, so it is
now. The facts proclaim it aloud.” While He was in the midst of saying these things, the
Samaritans came forth, and the fruit was at once gathered together. On this account903 He
said, “Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white.” Thus He spake, and the
fact was clear, and the words seen (true) by the event. For saith St. John,</p>
<p>Ver. 39. “Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him for the saying of the woman
which testified, He told me all that ever I did.”</p>
<p>They perceived904 that the woman would not from favor have admired One who had
rebuked her sins, nor to gratify another have paraded her own course of life.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then also imitate this woman, and in the case of our own sins not be ashamed
of men, but fear, as is meet, God who now beholdeth what is done, and who hereafter punisheth
those who do not now repent. At present we do the opposite of this, for we fear not
Him who shall judge us, but shudder at those who do not in anything hurt us, and tremble
at the shame which comes from them. Therefore in the very thing which we fear, in this do
we incur punishment. For he who now regards only the reproach of men, but when God
seeth is not ashamed to do anything unseemly, and who will not repent and be converted,
in that day will be made an example, not only before one or two, but in the sight of the whole
world. For that a vast assembly is seated there to behold righteous actions as well as those
which are not such, let the parable of the sheep and the goats teach thee, as also the blessed
Paul when He saith, “For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be
good or bad” ( 2 Cor. v. 10 ), and again, “Who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness.”
( 1 Cor. iv. 5.) Hast thou done or imagined any evil thing, and dost thou hide it from
man? yet from God thou hidest it not. But for this thou careth nothing; the eyes of men,
these are thy fear. Think then that thou wilt not be able to escape the sight even of men in
that day905 ; for all things as in a picture shall then be set before our very eyes, so that each
shall be self-condemned. This is clear even from the instance of Dives, for the poor man
whom he had neglected, Lazarus I mean, he saw standing before his eyes, and the finger
which he had often loathed, he intreats may become a comfort to him then. I exhort you
therefore, that although no one see what we do, yet that each of us enter into his own con-

<pb n="244"/>
science, and set reason for his judge, and bring forward his transgressions, and if he desire
them not to be exposed to public view then in that fearful day, let him now heal his wounds,
let him apply to them the medicines of repentance. For it is in the power, yea, it is in the
power of one full of ten thousand wounds to go hence whole. For “if ye forgive,” He saith,
“your sins are forgiven unto you.”906 ( Matt. vi. 14 , not verbally quoted.) For as sins buried907
in Baptism appear no more, so these908 also shall disappear, if we be willing to repent. And
repentance is the not doing the same again; for he that again puts his hand to the same, is
like the dog that returneth to his own vomit, and like him in the proverb who cards wool
into the fire,909 and draws water into a cask full of holes. It behooves therefore to depart
both in action and in thought from what we have dared to do, and having departed, to apply
to the wounds the remedies which are the contraries of our sins. For instance: hast thou
been grasping and covetous? Abstain from rapine, and apply almsgiving to the wound. Hast
thou been a fornicator? Abstain from fornication, and apply chastity to the wound. Hast
thou spoken ill of thy brother, and injured him? Cease finding fault,910 and apply kindness.
Let us thus act with respect to each point in which we have offended, and let us not carelessly
pass by our sins, for there awaiteth us hereafter, there awaiteth us a season of account.
Wherefore also Paul said, “The Lord is at hand: be careful for nothing.” ( Philip. iv. 5, 6.)
But we perhaps must add the contrary of this, “The Lord is at hand, be careful.” For they
might well hear, “Be careful for nothing,” living as they did in affliction, and labors, and
trials; but they who live by rapine, or in luxury, and who shall give a grievous reckoning,
would in reason hear not this, but that other, “The Lord is at hand, be careful.” Since no
long time now remains until the consummation, but the world is hastening to its end; this
the wars declare, this the afflictions, this the earthquakes, this the love which hath waxed
cold. For as the body when in its last gasp and near to death, draws to itself ten thousand
sufferings; and as when a house is about to fall, many portions are wont to fall beforehand
from the roof and walls; so is the end of the world nigh and at the very doors, and therefore
ten thousand woes are everywhere scattered abroad. If the Lord was then “at hand,” much
more is He now “at hand.” If three hundred911 years ago, when those words were used, Paul
called that season “the fullness of time,” much more would he have called the present so.
But perhaps for this very reason some disbelieve, yet they ought on this account to believe
<note type="footnote">906 ms. in Bodl. reads, “My Heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if ye forgive not, neither will He forgive
you.” </note>

the more. For whence knowest thou, O man, that the end is not “at hand,” and the words
shortly to be accomplished? For as we speak of the end of the year not as being the last day,
but also the last month, though it has thirty days; so if of so many years I call even four
hundred years “the end,” I shall not be wrong; and so at that time Paul spoke of the end by
anticipation. Let us then set ourselves in order, let us delight in the fear of God; for if we
live here without fear of Him, His coming will surprise us suddenly, when we are neither
careful, nor looking for Him. As Christ declared when He said, “For as in the days of Noah,
and as in the days of Lot, so shall it be at the end of this world.” ( Matt. xxiv. 37 , not verbally
quoted.) This also Paul declared when he said, “For when they shall say, Peace and safety,
then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child.” ( 1 Thess.
v. 3.) What means, “as travail upon a woman with child”? Often have pregnant women when
sporting, or at their meals, or in the bath or market-place, and foreseeing nothing of what
was coming, been seized in a moment by their pains. Now since our case is like theirs, let
us ever be prepared, for we shall not always hear these things, we shall not always have power
to do them. “In the grave” saith David, “who shall give Thee thanks?”912 ( Ps. vi. 5.) Let us
then repent here, that so we may find God merciful unto us in the day that is to come, and
be enabled to enjoy abundant forgiveness; which may we all obtain, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion now and ever,
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXV.</head>
<p>John iv. 40–43</p>
<p>“So when the Samaritans were come unto Him, they besought Him that He would tarry with
them: and He abode there two days. And many more believed because of His own Word;
and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard
Him ourselves, and know that This is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. Now
after two days He departed thence, and went into Galilee.”</p>
<p>Nothing is worse than envy and malice, nothing more mischievous than vainglory; it
is wont to mar ten thousand good things. So the Jews, who excelled the Samaritans in
knowledge, and had been always familiar with913 the Prophets, were shown from this cause
inferior to them. For these believed even on the testimony of the woman, and without having
seen any sign, came forth beseeching Christ to tarry914 with them; but the Jews, when they
had beheld His wonders, not only did not detain Him among them, but even drove Him
away, and used every means to cast Him forth from their land, although His very Coming915
had been for their sake. The Jews expelled Him, but these even entreated Him to tarry with
them. Was it not then rather fitting, tell me, that He should receive those who asked and
besought Him, than that He should wait upon those who plotted against and repulsed Him,
while to those who loved and desired to retain Him He gave not Himself? Surely this would
not have been worthy of His tender care;916 He therefore both accepted917 them, and tarried
with them two days. They desired to keep Him among them continually, (for this the
Evangelist has shown by saying, that “they besought Him that He would tarry with them,”)
but this He endured not, but stayed with them only two days; and in these many more believed
on Him. Yet there was no likelihood that these would have believed, since they had
seen no sign, and had hostile feelings towards the Jews; but still, inasmuch as they gave in
sincerity their judgment on His words, this stood not in their way, but they received a notion
which surmounted their hindrances, and vied with each other to reverence Him the more.
For, saith the Evangelist, “they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying:
for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of
the world.” The scholars overshot their instructress. With good reason might they condemn
the Jews, both by their believing on, and their receiving Him. The Jews, for whose sake He

had contrived918 the whole scheme,919 continually were for stoning Him,920 but these, when
He was not even intending to come to them, drew Him to themselves. And they, even with
signs, remain uncorrected; these, without signs, manifested great faith respecting Him, and
glory in this very thing that they believe without them; while the others ceased not asking921
for signs and tempting Him.</p>
<p>Such need is there everywhere of an honest soul; and if truth lay hold on such an one,
she easily masters it; or if she masters it not, this is owing not to any weakness of truth, but
to want of candor922 in the soul itself. Since the sun too, when he encounters clear eyes,
easily enlightens them; if he enlightens them not, it is the fault of their infirmity, not of his
weakness.</p>
<p>Hear then what these say; “We know that this is of a truth the Christ, the Saviour of the
world.” Seest thou how they at once understood that He should draw the world to Him,
that He came to order aright923 our common salvation, that He intended not to confine His
care to the Jews, but to sow His Word everywhere? The Jews did not so, but going about to
establish their own righteousness, submitted not themselves to the righteousness of God;
while these confess that all are deserving of punishment, declaring with the Apostle, that
“all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace.” (
Rom. iii. 23, 24.) For by saying that He was “the Saviour of the world,” they showed that it
was of a lost world,924 and He not simply a Saviour, but one of the very mightiest. For many
had come to “save,” both Prophets and Angels925 ; but this, saith one, is the True Saviour,
who affordeth the true salvation, not that which is but for a time. This proceeded from pure
faith. And in both ways are they admirable; because they believed, and because they did so
without signs, (whom Christ also calleth “blessed,” saying, “Blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed,”) ( c. xx. 29 ,) and because they did so sincerely. Though they
had heard the woman say doubtfully, “Is not this the Christ?” they did not also say, “we too
suspect,” or, “we think,”926 but, “we know,” and not merely, “we know,” but, “we know that
this is of a truth the Saviour of the world.” They acknowledged Christ not as one of the
many,927 but as the “Saviour” indeed. Yet whom had they seen saved? They had but heard

His words, and yet they spake as they would have spoken had they beheld many and great
marvels. And why do not the Evangelists tell us these words, and that He discoursed admirably?
That thou mayest learn that they pass by many important matters, and yet have declared
the whole to us by the event. For He persuaded an entire people and a whole city by His
words. When His hearers are not persuaded, then the writers are constrained to mention
what was said, lest any one from the insensibility of the hearers should give a judgment
against Him who addressed them.</p>
<p>“Now after two days He departed thence and went into Galilee.”</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “For Jesus Himself testified that a Prophet hath no honor in his own country.”</p>
<p>Wherefore is this added? Because He departed not unto Capernaum, but into Galilee,
and thence to Cana. For that thou mayest not enquire why He tarried not with His own
people, but tarried with the Samaritans, the Evangelist puts the cause,928 saying that they
gave no heed unto Him; on this account He went not thither, that their condemnation might
not be the greater. For I suppose that in this place He speaketh of Capernaum as “His
country.” Now, to show that there He received no honor, hear Him say, “And thou, Capernaum,
which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell.” ( Matt. xi. 23.) He
calleth it “His own country,” because there He set forth the Word of the Dispensation, and
more especially dwelt upon it. “What then,” saith some one, “do we not see many admired
among their kindred?” In the first place such judgments must not be formed from rare instances;
and again, if some have been honored in their own, they would have been much
more honored in a strange country, for familiarity is wont to make men easily despised.</p>
<p>Ver. 45. “Then when He was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received Him, having
seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast, for they also came unto the feast.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that these men so ill spoken of are found most to come to Him? For one said,
“Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” ( c. i. 46 ), and another, “Search and
look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” ( c. vii. 52.) These things they said insulting
Him, because He was supposed by the many to be of Nazareth, and they also reproached
Him with being a Samaritan; “Thou art a Samaritan,” said one, “and hast a devil.” ( c. viii.
48.) Yet behold, both Samaritans and Galilæans believe, to the shame of the Jews, and
Samaritans are found better than Galilæans, for the first received Him through the words
of the woman, the second when they had seen the miracles which He did.</p>
<p>Ver. 46. “So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine.”</p>
<p>The Evangelist reminds the hearer of the miracle to exalt the praise of the Samaritans.
The men of Cana received Him by reason of the miracles which He had done in Jerusalem
and in that place; but not so the Samaritans, they received Him through His teaching alone.</p>
<note type="footnote">928 ms. in Bodl. “and this is, that ‘ a prophet hath no honor in his own country. ’”</note>

<pb n="249"/>
<p>That He came then “to Cana,” the Evangelist has said, but he has not added the cause
why He came.929 Into Galilee He had come because of the envy of the Jews; but wherefore
to Cana? At first He came, being invited to a marriage; but wherefore now? Methinks to
confirm by His presence the faith which had been implanted by His miracle, and to draw
them to Him the more by coming to them self-invited, by leaving His own country, and by
preferring them.</p>
<p>“And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.”</p>
<p>Ver. 47. “When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto
Him and besought Him that He would come down and heal his son.”</p>
<p>This person certainly was of royal race, or possessed some dignity from his office, to
which the title “noble” was attached. Some indeed think that this is the man mentioned by
Matthew ( Matt. viii. 5 ), but he is shown to be a different person, not only from his dignity,
but also from his faith. That other, even when Christ was willing to go to him, entreats Him
to tarry; this one, when He had made no such offer, draws Him to his house. The one saith,
“I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof”; but this other even urges930
Him, saying, “Come down ere my son die.” In that instance He came down from the
mountain, and entered into Capernaum; but here, as He came from Samaria, and went not
into Capernaum but into Cana, this person met Him. The servant of the other was possessed
by the palsy, this one’s son by a fever.</p>
<p>“And he came and besought Him that He would heal his son: for he was at the point of
death.” What saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 48. “Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.”</p>
<p>Yet the very coming and beseeching Him was a mark of faith. And besides, after this
the Evangelist witnesses to him,931 declaring that when Jesus said, “Go, thy son liveth,” he
believed His word, and went. What then is that which He saith here? Either He useth the
words as approving of932 the Samaritans because they believed without signs; or, to touch
Capernaum which was thought to be His own city, and of which this person was. Moreover,
another man in Luke, who says, “Lord, I believe,” said besides, “help Thou mine unbelief.”933
And so if this ruler also believed, yet he believed not entirely or soundly, as is clear from his
enquiring “at what hour the fever left him,” since he desired to know whether it did so of
its own accord, or at the bidding of Christ. When therefore he knew that it was “yesterday
at the seventh hour,” then “himself believed and his whole house.”</p>

<p>Seest thou that he believed when his servants, not when Christ spake? Therefore He
rebuketh the state of mind with which he had come to Him, and spoken as he did, (thus too
He the more drew him on to belief,) because that before the miracle he had not believed
strongly. That he came and entreated was nothing wonderful, for parents in their great affection
are also wont to resort not only to physicians in whom they have confidence, but
also to talk with those in whom they have no confidence, desiring to omit nothing
whatever.934 Indeed, that he came without any strong purpose935 appears from this, that
when Christ was come into Galilee, then he saw Him, whereas if he had firmly believed in
Him, he would not, when his child was on the point of death, have hesitated to go into
Judæa. Or if he was afraid, this is not to be endured either.936</p>
<p>Observe how the very words show the weakness of the man; when he ought, after Christ
had rebuked his state of mind, to have imagined something great concerning Him, even if
he did not so before, listen how he drags along the ground.</p>
<p>Ver. 49. “Sir,” he saith, “come down ere my child die.”</p>
<p>As though He could not raise him after death, as though He knew not what state the
child was in. It is for this that Christ rebuketh him and toucheth his conscience, to show
that His miracles were wrought principally for the sake of the soul. For here He healeth the
father, sick in mind, no less than the son, in order to persuade us to give heed to Him, not
by reason of His miracles, but of His teaching. For miracles are not for the faithful, but for
the unbelieving and the grosser sort.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> At that time then, owing to his emotion, the nobleman gave no great heed to the
words, or to those only which related to his son,937 yet he would afterwards recollect what
had been said, and draw from thence the greatest advantage. As indeed was the case.</p>
<p>But what can be the reason why in the case of the centurion He by a free offer undertook
to come, while here though invited, He goeth not? Because in the former case faith had been
perfected, and therefore He undertook to go, that we might learn the rightmindedness of
the man; but here the nobleman was imperfect. When therefore he continually938 urged
Him, saying, “Come down,” and knew not yet clearly that even when absent He could heal,
He showeth that even this was possible unto Him in order that this man might gain from
Jesus not going, that knowledge which the centurion had of himself.939 And so when He
saith,“Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe,” His meaning is, “Ye have not

yet the right faith, but still feel towards Me as towards a Prophet.” Therefore to reveal
Himself and to show that he ought to have believed even without miracles, He said what
He said also to Philip, “Believest thou940 that the Father is in Me and I in the Father?941 Or
if not, believe Me for the very works’ sake.” ( c. xiv. 10, 11.)</p>
<p>Ver. 51–53. “And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying,
Thy son liveth. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said
unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at
the same hour in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and
his whole house.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how evident the miracle was? Not simply nor in a common way was the child
freed from danger, but all at once, so that what took place was seen to be the consequence
not of nature, but the working942 of Christ. For when he had reached the very gates of death,
as his father showed by saying, “Come down ere my child die”; he was all at once freed from
the disease. A fact which roused the servants also, for they perhaps came to meet their
master, not only to bring him the good news, but also deeming that the coming of Jesus was
now superfluous, (for they knew that their master was gone there,) and so they met him
even in the way. The man released from his fear, thenceforth escaped943 into faith, being
desirous to show that what had been done was the result of his journey, and thenceforth he
is ambitious of appearing not to have exerted himself944 to no purpose; so he ascertained
all things exactly, and “himself believed and his whole house.” For the evidence was after
this unquestionable. For they who had not been present nor had heard Christ speak nor
known the time, when they had heard from their master that such and such was the time,
had incontrovertible demonstration of His power. Wherefore they also believed.</p>
<p>What now are we taught by these things? Not to wait for miracles, nor to seek pledges
of the Power of God. I see many persons even now become more pious,945 when during the
sufferings of a child or the sickness of a wife they enjoy any comfort, yet they ought even if
they obtain it not, to persist just the same in giving thanks, in glorifying God. Because it is
the part of right-minded servants, and of those who feel such affection946 and love as they
ought for their Master, not only when pardoned, but also when scourged, to run to Him.
For these also are effects of the tender care of God; “Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,

and scourgeth,” it says, “every son whom He receiveth.” ( Heb. xii. 6.) When therefore a
man serves Him only in the season of ease, he gives proofs of no great love, and loves not
Christ purely. And why speak I of health, or abundant riches, or poverty, or disease?
Shouldest thou hear of the fiery pit or of any other dreadful thing, not even so must thou
cease from speaking good of thy Master, but suffer and do all things because of thy love for
Him. For this is the part of right-minded servants and of an unswerving soul; and he who
is disposed after this sort will easily endure the present, and obtain good947 things to come,
and enjoy much confidence in the presence of948 God; which may it be that we all obtain
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father
and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John iv. 54; v. 1</p>
<p>“This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when He was come out of Judæa into Galilee.
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> As in gold mines one skillful in what relates to them would not endure to overlook
even the smallest vein as producing much wealth, so in the holy Scriptures it is impossible
without loss to pass by one jot or one tittle, we must search into all. For they all are uttered
by the Holy Spirit, and nothing useless949 is written in them.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, what the Evangelist in this place saith, “This is again the second
miracle that Jesus did, when He was come out of Judæa into Galilee.” Even the word “second”
he has added not without cause, but to exalt yet more the praise950 of the Samaritans, by
showing that even when a second miracle had been wrought, they who beheld it had not
yet reached as high as those who had not seen one.</p>
<p>“After this there was a feast of the Jews.” What “feast”? Methinks that of Pentecost. “And
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.” Continually at the feasts He frequenteth the City, partly that
He might appear to feast with them, partly that He might attract the multitude that was free
from guile; for during these days951 especially, the more simply disposed ran together more
than at other times.</p>
<p>Ver. 2, 3. “Now there is at Jerusalem a sheep pool,952 called in the Hebrew tongue
Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk,953 of halt,
blind, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.”</p>
<p>What manner of cure is this? What mystery doth it signify to us? For these things are
not written carelessly, or without a purpose, but as by a figure and type they show in outline954
things to come, in order that what was exceedingly strange might not by coming
unexpectedly harm among the many the power of faith.955 What then is it that they show
in outline? A Baptism was about to be given, possessing much power, and the greatest of
gifts, a Baptism purging all sins, and making men alive instead of dead. These things then
are foreshown as in a picture by the pool, and by many other circumstances. And first is

given a water which purges the stains of our bodies, and those defilements which are not,
but seem to be, as those from touching the dead,956 those from leprosy, and other similar
causes; under the old covenant one may see many things done by water on this account.
However, let us now proceed to the matter in hand.</p>
<p>First then, as I before said, He causeth defilements of our bodies, and afterwards infirmities
of different kinds, to be done away by water. Because God, desiring to bring us nearer
to faith in957 baptism, no longer healeth defilements only, but diseases also. For those figures
which came nearer [in time] to the reality, both as regarded Baptism, and the Passion, and
the rest, were plainer than the more ancient;958 and as the guards near the person of the
prince are more splendid than those before,959 so was it with the types. And “an Angel came
down and troubled the water,” and endued it with a healing power, that the Jews might
learn that much more could the Lord of Angels heal the diseases960 of the soul. Yet as here
it was not simply the nature of the water that healed, (for then this would have always taken
place,) but water joined to the operation961 of the Angel; so in our case, it is not merely the
water that worketh, but when it hath received the grace of the Spirit, then it putteth away962
all our sins. Around this pool “lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered,
waiting for the moving of the water”; but then infirmity was a hindrance to him who desired
to be healed, now each hath power to approach, for now it is not an Angel that troubleth,
it is the Lord of Angels who worketh all. The sick man cannot now say, “I have no man”;
he cannot say, “While I am coming another steppeth down before me”; though the whole
world should come, the grace is not spent, the power is not exhausted, but remaineth equally
great as it was before. Just as the sun’s beams give light every day, yet are not exhausted, nor
is their light made less by giving so abundant a supply; so, and much more, the power of
the Spirit is in no way lessened by the numbers of those who enjoy it. And this miracle was
done in order that men, learning that it is possible by water to heal the diseases of the body,
and being exercised in this for a long time, might more easily believe that it can also heal
the diseases of the soul.</p>
<p>But why did Jesus, leaving the rest, come to one who was of thirty-eight years standing?
And why did He ask him, “Wilt thou be made whole?” Not that He might learn, that was
needless; but that He might show963 the man’s perseverance, and that we might know that

it was on this account that He left the others and came to him. What then saith he? “Yea
Lord,” he saith, but “I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool, but
while I am coming another steppeth down before me.”</p>
<p>It was that we might learn these circumstances that Jesus asked, “Wilt thou be made
whole?” and said not, “Wilt thou that I heal thee?” (for as yet the man had formed no exalted
notions concerning Him,) but “Wilt thou be made whole?” Astonishing was the perseverance
of the paralytic, he was of thirty and eight years standing, and each year hoping to be freed
from his disease, he continued in attendance,964 and withdrew not. Had he not been very
persevering, would not the future,965 if not the past, have been sufficient to lead him from
the spot? Consider, I pray you, how watchful it was likely that the other sick men there
would be since the time when the water was troubled was uncertain. The lame and halt indeed
might observe it, but how did the blind see? Perhaps they learnt it from the clamor which
arose.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Let us be ashamed then, beloved, let us be ashamed, and groan over our excessive
sloth. “Thirty and eight years” had that man been waiting without obtaining what he desired,
and withdrew not. And he had failed not through any carelessness of his own, but through
being oppressed and suffering violence from others, and not even thus did he grow dull;966
while we if we have persisted for ten days to pray for anything and have not obtained it, are
too slothful afterwards to employ the same zeal. And on men we wait for so long a time,
warring and enduring hardships and performing servile ministrations, and often at last
failing in our expectation, but on our967 Master, from whom we are sure to obtain a recom-
pense greater than our labors, (for, saith the Apostle, “Hope maketh not ashamed”— Rom.
v. 5 ,) on Him we endure not to wait with becoming diligence. What chastisement doth this
deserve! For even though we could receive nothing from Him, ought we not to deem the
very conversing with Him continually the cause of968 ten thousand blessings? “But continual
prayer is a laborious thing.” And what that belongs to virtue is not laborious? “In truth,”
says some one, “this very point is full of great difficulty, that pleasure is annexed to vice,
and labor to virtue.” And many, I think, make this a question. What then can be the reason?
969 God gave us at the beginning a life free from care and exempt from labor. We used
not the gift aright, but were perverted by doing nothing,970 and were banished from Paradise.

On which account He made our life for the future one of toil, assigning as it were His reasons
for this to mankind, and saying, “I allowed you at the beginning to lead a life of enjoyment,971
but ye were rendered worse by liberty, wherefore I commanded that henceforth labor and
sweat be laid upon you.”972 And when even this labor did not restrain us, He next gave us
a law containing many commandments, imposing it on us like bits and curbs placed upon
an unruly horse to restrain his prancings, just as horse breakers do. This is why life is laborious,
because not to labor is wont to be our ruin. For our nature cannot bear to be doing
nothing, but easily turns aside to wickedness. Let us suppose that the man who is temperate,
and he who rightly performs the other virtues, has no need of labor, but that they do all
things in their sleep, still how should we have employed our ease? Would it not have been
for pride and boastfulness? “But wherefore,” saith some one, “has great pleasure been attached
to vice, great labor and toil to virtue?” Why, what thanks wouldest thou have had, and for
what wouldest thou have received a reward, if the matter had not been one of difficulty?
Even now I can show you many who naturally hate intercourse with women, and avoid
conversation with them as impure; shall we then call these chaste, shall we crown these, tell
me, and proclaim them victors? By no means. Chastity is self-restraint, and the mastering
pleasures which fight, just as in war the trophies are most honorable when the contest is
violent, not when no one raises a hand against us. Many are by their very nature passionless;
shall we call these good tempered? Not at all. And so the Lord after naming three manners
of the eunuch state, leaveth two of them uncrowned, and admitteth one into the kingdom
of heaven. ( Matt. xix. 12.) “But what need,” saith one, “was there of wickedness?” I say this
too. “What is it then which made wickedness to be?” What but our willful negligence? “But,”
saith one, “there ought to be only good men.” Well, what is proper to the good man? Is it
to watch and be sober, or to sleep and snore? “And why,” saith one, “seemed 973 it not good
that a man should act rightly without laboring?” Thou speakest words which become the
cattle or gluttons, or who make their belly their god. For to prove that these are the words
of folly, answer me this. Suppose there were a king and a general, and while the king was
asleep or drunk, the general should endure hardship and erect a trophy, whose would you
count the victory to be? who would enjoy the pleasure of what was done? Seest thou that
the soul is more especially disposed towards those things for which she hath labored? and
therefore God hath joined labors to virtue, wishing to make us attached to her. For this
cause we admire virtue, even although we act not rightly ourselves, while we condemn vice
even though it be very pleasant. And if thou sayest, “Why do we not admire those who are
<note type="footnote">971 τρυφᾷν</note>
<note type="footnote">972 Morel. and ms. in Bodl. “therefore I have done that which remained to do, I have encompassed (or clothed)
you with labors and toils.”</note>
<note type="footnote">973 al. “thoughtest thou.”</note>

<pb n="257"/>
good by nature more than those who are so by choice?” we reply, Because it is just to prefer
him that laboreth to him that laboreth not. For why is it that we labor? It is because thou
didst not bear with moderation the not laboring. Nay more, if one enquire exactly, in other
ways also sloth is wont to undo us, and to cause us much trouble. Let us, if you will, shut a
man up, only feeding and pampering him, not allowing him to walk nor conducting him
forth to work, but let him enjoy table and bed, and be in luxury continually; what could be
more wretched than such a life? “But,” saith one, “to work is one thing, to labor is another.”974
Yea, but it was in man’s power then975 to work without labor. “And is this,” saith he, “possible?”
Yea, it is possible; God even desired it, but thou enduredst it not. Therefore He placed
thee to work in the garden, marking out employment, but joining with it no labor. For had
man labored at the beginning, God would not afterwards have put labor by way of punishment.
For it is possible to work and not to be wearied, as do the angels. To prove that they
work, hear what David saith; “Ye that excel in strength, ye that do His word.” ( Ps. ciii. 20 ,
LXX.) Want of strength causeth much labor now, but then it was not so. For “he that hath
entered into His rest, hath ceased,” saith one, “from his works, as God from His” ( Heb. iv.
10 ): not meaning here idleness, but the ceasing from labor. For God worketh even now,
as Christ saith, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” ( c. v. 17.) Wherefore I exhort
you that, laying aside all carelessness, you be zealous for virtue. For the pleasure of wickedness
is short, but the pain lasting; of virtue, on the contrary, the joy grows not old, the labor is
but for a season. Virtue even before the crowns are distributed animates976 her workman,
and feeds him with hopes; vice even before the time of vengeance punishes him who works
for her, wringing and terrifying his conscience, and making it apt to imagine all (evils). Are
not these things worse than any labors, than any toils? And if these things were not so, if
there were pleasure, what could be more worthless than that pleasure? for as soon as it appears
it flies away, withering and escaping before it has been grasped, whether you speak of the
pleasure of beauty, or that of luxury, or that of wealth, for they cease not daily to decay. But
when there is besides (for this pleasure) punishment and vengeance, what can be more
miserable than those who go after it? Knowing then this, let us endure all for virtue, so shall
we enjoy true pleasure, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>John v. 6, 7</p>
<p>“Jesus saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? The impotent man answered Him, Yea, Sir,
but I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great is the profit of the divine Scriptures, and all-sufficient is the aid which comes
from them. And Paul declared this when he said, “Whatsoever things were written aforetime,
were written aforetime for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come,
that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.” ( Rom. xv. 4, 1
Cor. x. 11.) For the divine oracles are a treasury of all manner of medicines, so that whether
it be needful to quench pride, to lull desire to sleep, to tread under foot the love of money,
to despise pain, to inspire confidence, to gain patience, from them one may find abundant
resource. For what man of those who struggle with long poverty or who are nailed to977 a
grievous disease, will not, when he reads the passage before us, receive much comfort? Since
this man who had been paralytic for thirty and eight years, and who saw each year others
delivered, and himself bound by his disease, not even so fell back and despaired, though in
truth not merely despondency for the past, but also hopelessness for the future, was sufficient
to over-strain978 him. Hear now what he says, and learn the greatness of his sufferings.979
For when Christ had said, “Wilt thou be made whole?” “Yea, Lord,” he saith, “but I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool.” What can be more pitiable than
these words? What more sad than these circumstances? Seest thou a heart980 crushed through
long sickness? Seest thou all violence subdued? He uttered no blasphemous word, nor such
as we hear the many use in reverses, he cursed not his day, he was not angry at the question,
nor did he say, “Art Thou come to make a mock and a jest of us, that Thou asketh whether
I desire to be made whole?” but replied gently, and with great mildness, “Yea, Lord”; yet he
knew not who it was that asked him, nor that He would heal him, but still he mildly relates
all the circumstances and asks nothing further, as though he were speaking to a physician,
and desired merely to tell the story of his sufferings. Perhaps he hoped that Christ might be
so far useful to him as to put him into the water, and desired to attract Him by these words.

<p>Now some suppose that this is the man in Matthew who was “lying on a bed” ( Matt.
ix. 2 ); but it is not so, as is clear in many ways. First, from his wanting persons to stand
forward for him. That man had many to care for and to carry him, this man not a single
one; wherefore he said, “I have no man.” Secondly, from the manner of answering; the
other uttered no word, but this man relates his whole case. Thirdly, from the season and
the time; this man was healed at a feast, and on the Sabbath, that other on a different day.
The places too were different; one was cured in a house, the other by the pool. The manner
also of the cure was altered; there Christ said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee,” but here He
braced982 the body first, and then cared for the soul. In that case there was remission of
sins, (for He saith, “Thy sins be forgiven thee,”) but in this, warning and threats to strengthen
the man for the future; “Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.” ( Ver. 14.) The
charges also of the Jews are different; here they object to Jesus, His working on the Sabbath,
there they charge Him with blasphemy.</p>
<p>Consider now, I pray you, the exceeding wisdom of God. He raised not up the man at
once, but first maketh him familiar by questioning, making way for the coming faith; nor
doth He only raise, but biddeth him “take up his bed,” so as to confirm the miracle that had
been wrought, and that none might suppose what was done to be illusion or a piece of acting.
For he would not, unless his limbs had been firmly and thoroughly compacted, have been
able to carry his bed. And this Christ often doth, effectually silencing those who would fain
be insolent. So in the case of the loaves, that no one might assert that the men had been
merely983 satisfied, and that what was done was an illusion, He caused that there should be
many relics of the loaves. So to the leper that was cleansed He said, “Go, show thyself to the
priest” ( Matt. viii. 4 ); at once providing most certain proof of the cleansing, and stopping
the shameless mouths of those who asserted that He was legislating in opposition to God.
This also He did in like manner in the case of the wine; for He did not merely show it to
them, but also caused it to be borne to the governor of the feast, in order that one who knew
nothing of what had been done, by his confession might bear to Him unsuspected testimony;
wherefore the Evangelist saith, that the ruler of the feast “knew not whence it was,” thus
showing the impartiality of his testimony. And in another place, when He raised the dead,
He said, “Give ye him to eat”;984 supplying this proof of a real resurrection, and by these
means persuading even the foolish that He was no deceiver, no dealer in illusions,985 but
that He had come for the salvation of the common nature of mankind.</p>

<pb n="260"/>
<p><del>2.</del> But why did not Jesus require faith of this man, as He did in the case of others,
saying, “Believest thou that I am able to do this?”986 It was because the man did not yet
clearly know who He was; and it is not before, but after the working of miracles that He is
seen so doing. For persons who had beheld His power exerted on others would reasonably
have this said to them, while of those who had not yet learned who He was, but who were
to know afterwards by means of signs, it is after the miracles that faith is required. And
therefore Matthew doth not introduce Christ as having said this at the beginning of His
miracles, but when He had healed many, to the two blind men only.</p>
<p>Observe however in this way the faith of the paralytic. When he had heard,987 “Take
up thy bed and walk,” he did not mock, nor say, “What can this mean? An Angel cometh
down and troubleth the water, and healeth only one, and dost Thou, a man, by a bare
command and word hope to be able to do greater things than Angels? This is mere vanity,
boasting, mockery.” But he neither said nor imagined anything like this, but at once he
heard and arose, and becoming whole, was not disobedient to Him that gave the command;988
for immediately he was made whole, and “took up his bed, and walked.” What followed was
even far more admirable. That he believed at first, when no one troubled him, was not so
marvelous, but that afterwards, when the Jews were full of madness and pressed upon him
on all sides, accusing989 and besieging him and saying, “It is not lawful for thee to take up
thy bed,” that then he gave no heed to990 their madness, but most boldly in the midst of the
assembly991 proclaimed his Benefactor and silenced their shameless tongues, this, I say, was
an act of great courage. For when the Jews arose against him, and said in a reproachful and
insolent manner to him,</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “It is the Sabbath day, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed”; hear what he
saith:</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “He that made me whole, the Same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.”
All but saying, “Ye are silly and mad who bid me not to take Him for my Teacher who
has delivered me from a long and grievous malady, and not to obey whatever He may
command.”992 Had he chosen to act in an unfair manner, he might have spoke differently,

<pb n="261"/>
as thus, “I do not this of my own will, but at the bidding of another; if this be a matter of
blame, blame him who gave the order, and I will set down the bed.” And he might have
concealed the cure, for he well knew that they were vexed not so much at the breaking of
the Sabbath, as at the curing of his infirmity. Yet he neither concealed this, nor said that,
nor asked for pardon, but with loud voice confessed and proclaimed the benefit. Thus did
the paralytic; but consider how unfairly they acted. For they said not, “Who is it that hath
made thee whole?” on this point they were silent, but kept on bringing forward the seeming
transgression.</p>
<p>Ver. 12, 13. “What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed and walk? And
he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed Himself away,993 a multitude
being in that place.”</p>
<p>And why did Jesus conceal Himself? First, that while He was absent, the testimony of
the man might be unsuspected, for he who now felt himself whole was a credible witness of
the benefit. And in the next place, that He might not cause the fury of the Jews to be yet
more inflamed, for the very sight of one whom they envy is wont to kindle not a small spark
in malicious persons. On this account He retired, and left the deed by itself to plead its cause
among them, that He might not say anything in person respecting Himself, but that they
might do so who had been healed, and with them also the accusers. Even these last for a
while testify to the miracle, for they said not, “Wherefore hast thou commanded these things
to be done on the Sabbath day?” but, “Wherefore doest thou these things on the Sabbath
day?” not being displeased at the transgression, but envious at the restoration of the paralytic.
Yet in respect of human labor, what the paralytic did was rather a work, for the other994
was a saying and a word. Here then He commandeth another to break the Sabbath, but
elsewhere He doth the same Himself, mixing clay and anointing a man’s eyes ( c. 9 ); yet He
doth these things not transgressing, but going beyond the Law. And on this we shall hereafter
speak. For He doth not, when accused by the Jews respecting the Sabbath, always defend
Himself in the same terms, and this we must carefully observe.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But let us consider awhile how great an evil is envy, how it disables the eyes of the
soul to the endangering his salvation who is possessed by it. For as madmen often thrust
their swords against their own bodies, so also malicious persons looking only to one thing,
the injury995 of him they envy, care not for their own salvation. Men like these are worse
than wild beasts; they when wanting food, or having first been provoked by us, arm themselves
against us; but these men when they have received kindness, have often repaid their
benefactors as though they had wronged them. Worse than wild beasts are they, like the

<note type="footnote">994 i.e. that which Jesus did.</note>
<note type="footnote">995 al. “pain.”</note>

<pb n="262"/>
devils, or perhaps worse than even those; for they against us indeed have unceasing hostility,
but do not plot against those of their own nature, (and so by this Jesus silenced the Jews
when they said that He cast out devils by Beelzebub,) but these men neither respect their
common nature, nor spare their own selves. For before they vex those whom they envy they
vex their own souls, filling them with all manner of trouble and despondency, fruitlessly
and in vain. For wherefore grievest thou, O man, at the prosperity of thy neighbor? We
ought to grieve at the ills we suffer, not because we see others in good repute. Wherefore
this sin is stripped of all excuse. The fornicator may allege his lust, the thief his poverty, the
man-slayer his passion, frigid excuses and unreasonable, still they have these to allege. But
what reason, tell me, wilt thou name? None other at all, but that of intense wickedness. If
we are commanded to love our enemies, what punishment shall we suffer if we hate our
very friends? And if he who loveth those that love him will be in no better a state than the
heathen, what excuse, what palliation shall he have who injures those that have done him
no wrong? Hear Paul, what he saith, “Though I give my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing” ( 1 Cor. xiii. 3 ); now it is clear to every one that where envy
and malice are, there charity is not. This feeling is worse than fornication and adultery, for
these go no farther than him who doeth them, but the tyranny of envy hath overturned entire
Churches, and hath destroyed the whole world. Envy is the mother of murder. Through
this Cain slew Abel his brother; through this Esau (would have slain) Jacob, and his brethren
Joseph, through this the devil all mankind. Thou indeed now killest not, but thou dost many
things worse than murder, desiring that thy brother may act unseemly, laying snares for
him on all sides, paralyzing his labors on the side of virtue, grieving that he pleaseth the
Master of the world. Yet thou warrest not with thy brother, but with Him whom he serves,
Him thou insultest when thou preferest thy glory to His. And what is in truth worst of all,
is that this sin seems to be an unimportant one, while in fact it is more grievous than any
other; for though thou showest mercy and watchest and fastest, thou art more accursed than
any if thou enviest thy brother. As is clear from this circumstance also. A man of the Corinthians
was once guilty of adultery, yet he was charged with his sin and soon restored to
righteousness; Cain envied Abel; but he was not healed, and although God Himself continually
charmed996 the wound, he became more pained and wave-tossed, and was hurried on
to murder. Thus this passion is worse than that other, and doth not easily permit itself to
be cured except we give heed. Let us then by all means tear it up by the roots, considering
this, that as we offend God when we waste with envy at other men’s blessings, so when we
rejoice with them we are well pleasing to Him, and render ourselves partakers of the good
things laid up for the righteous. Therefore Paul exhorteth us to “Rejoice with them that do
<note type="footnote">996 ἐ πᾴδοντος</note>

<pb n="263"/>
rejoice, and weep with them that weep” ( Rom. xii. 15 ), that on either hand we may reap
great profit.</p>
<p>Considering then that even when we labor not, by rejoicing with him that laboreth, we
become sharers of his crown, let us cast aside all envy, and implant charity in our souls, that
by applauding those of our brethren who are well pleasing unto God, we may obtain both
present and future good things, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXVIII.</head>
<p>John v. 14</p>
<p>“Afterward Jesus findeth him in the Temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole;
sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A fearful thing is sin, fearful, and the ruin of the soul, and the mischief oftentimes
through its excess has overflowed and attacked men’s bodies also. For since for the most
part when the soul is diseased we feel no pain, but if the body receive though but a little
hurt, we use every exertion to free it from its infirmity, because we are sensible of the infirmity,
997 therefore God oftentimes punisheth the body for the transgressions of the soul, so
that by means of the scourging of the inferior part, the better part also may receive some
healing. Thus too among the Corinthians Paul restored the adulterer, checking the disease
of the soul by the destruction of the flesh, and having applied the knife to the body, so
repressed the evil ( 1 Cor. v. 5 ); like some excellent physician employing external cautery
for dropsy or spleen, when they refuse to yield to internal remedies. This also Christ did in
the case of the paralytic; as He showed when He said, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no
more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”</p>
<p>Now what do we learn from this? First, that his disease had been produced by his sins;
secondly, that the accounts of hell fire are to be believed; thirdly, that the punishment is
long, nay endless. Where now are those who say, “I murdered in an hour, I committed
adultery in a little moment of time, and am I eternally punished?” For behold this man had
not sinned for so many years as he suffered, for he had spent a whole lifetime in the length
of his punishment; and sins are not judged by time, but by the nature of the transgressions.
Besides this, we may see998 another thing, that though we have suffered severely for former
sins, if we afterwards fall into the same, we shall suffer much more severely. And with good
reason; for he who is not made better even by punishment, is afterwards led as insensible
and a despiser to still heavier chastisement. The fault should of itself be sufficient to check
and to render more sober the man who once has slipped, but when not even the addition
of punishment effects this, he naturally requires more bitter torments.999 Now if even in
this world when after punishment1000 we fall into the same sins, we are chastised yet more
<note type="footnote">997 Sav. omits “because we are sensible of the infirmity.”</note>
<note type="footnote">998 al. “learn.”</note>
<note type="footnote">999 Ben. and ms. in Bodl. read the passage thus: “For the chastisement was of itself sufficient…but when not
being sobered by the application of punishment, he again dares the same things, such an one will reasonably
suffer some penalty, calling this as he does upon his own self.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1000 al. “have been punished here.”</note>

<pb n="265"/>
severely then before, ought we not when after sinning we have not been punished at all, to
be then1001 very exceedingly afraid and to tremble, as being about to endure something irreparable?
“And wherefore,” saith some one, “are not all thus punished? for we see many
bad men well in body, vigorous, and enjoying great prosperity.” But let us not be confident,
let us mourn for them in this case most of all, since their having suffered nothing here, helps
them on1002 to a severer vengeance hereafter.1003 As Paul declares when he saith, “But now
that we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with
the world” ( 1 Cor. xi. 32 ); for the punishments here are for warning, there for vengeance.</p>
<p>“What then,” saith one, “do all diseases proceed from sin?” Not all, but most of them;
and some proceed from different kinds of loose living,1004 since gluttony, intemperance,
and sloth, produce such like sufferings. But the one rule we have to observe, is to bear every
stroke thankfully; for they are sent because of our sins, as in the Kings we see one attacked
by gout ( 1 Kings xv. 23 ); they are sent also to make us approved, as the Lord saith to Job,
“Thinkest thou that</p>
<p>But why is it that in the case of these paralytics Christ bringeth forward their sins? For
He saith also to him in Matthew who lay on a bed, “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven
thee” ( Matt. ix. 2 ): and to this man, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more.”1005
I know that some slander this paralytic, asserting that he was an accuser of Christ, and that
therefore this speech was addressed to him; what then shall we say of the other in Matthew,
who heard nearly the same words? For Christ saith to him also, “Thy sins be forgiven thee.”
Whence it is clear, that neither was this man thus addressed on the account which they allege.
And this we may see more clearly from what follows;1006 for, saith the Evangelist, “Afterward
Jesus findeth him in the Temple,” which is an indication of his great piety; for he departed
not into the market places and walks, nor gave himself up to luxury and ease, but remained
in the Temple, although about to sustain so violent an attack and to be harassed by all
there.1007 Yet none of these things persuaded him to depart from the Temple. Moreover
Christ having found him, even after he had conversed with the Jews, implied nothing of the
kind. For had He desired to charge him with this, He would have said to him, “Art thou
<note type="footnote">1001 al. “at this.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1002 ἐ φόδιον γίγνεται. So Euseb. H. E. viii. 10, ἐ φ. τῆς εἰς τὴν ζωὴν εἰσόδου</note>

<pb n="266"/>
again attempting the same sins as before, art thou not made better by thy cure?” Yet He said
nothing of the kind, but merely secureth him for the future.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Why then, when He had cured the halt and maimed, did He not in any instance
make mention of the like? Methinks that the diseases of these (the paralytic) arose from acts
of sin, those of the others from natural infirmity. Or if this be not so, then by means of these
men, and by the words spoken to them, He hath spoken to the rest also. For since this disease
is more grievous than any other, by the greater He correcteth also the less. And as when He
had healed a certain other He charged him to give glory to God, addressing this exhortation
not to him only but through him to all, so He addresseth to these, and by these to all the
rest of mankind, that exhortation and advice which was given to them by word of mouth.
Besides this we may also say, that Jesus perceived great endurance in his soul, and addressed
the exhortation to him as to one who was able to receive His command, keeping him to
health both by the benefit, and by the fear of future ills.</p>
<p>And observe the absence of boasting. He said not, “Behold, I have made thee whole,”
but, “Thou art made whole; sin no more.” And again, not, “lest I punish thee,” but, “lest a
worse thing come unto thee”; putting both expressions not personally,1008 and showing
that the cure was rather of grace than of merit. For He declared not to him that he was delivered
after suffering the deserved amount of punishment, but that through lovingkindness
he was made whole. Had this not been the case, He would have said, “Behold, thou hast
suffered a sufficient punishment for thy sins, be thou steadfast for the future.” But now He
spake not so, but how? “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more.” Let us continually repeat
these words to ourselves, and if after having been chastised we have been delivered, let each
say to himself, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more.” But if we suffer not punishment
though continuing in the same courses, let us use for our charm that word of the Apostle,
“The goodness of God leadeth <del>us</del> to repentance, but after <del>our</del> hardness and impenitent
heart, <del>we</del> treasure up unto <del>ourselves</del> wrath.” ( Rom. ii. 4, 5.)</p>
<p>And not only by strengthening1009 the sick man’s body, but also in another way, did
He afford him a strong proof of His Divinity; for by saying, “Sin no more,” He showed that
He knew all the transgressions that had formerly been committed by him; and by this He
would gain his belief as to the future.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had made him
whole.”</p>
<p>Again observe him continuing in the same right feeling. He saith not, “This is he who
said, Take up thy bed,” but when they continually advanced this seeming charge, he continually
puts forward the defense, again declaring his Healer, and seeking to attract and attach
<note type="footnote">1008 ἀ προσώπως, i.e. not referring to Himself.</note>
<note type="footnote">1009 σφίγξαι</note>

<pb n="267"/>
others to Him. For he was not so unfeeling as after such a benefit and charge to betray his
Benefactor, and to speak as he did with an evil intention. Had he been a wild beast, had he
been something unlike a man and of stone, the benefit and the fear would have been enough
to restrain him, since, having the threat lodged within, he would have dreaded lest he should
suffer “a worse thing,” having already received the greatest pledges1010 of the power of his
Physician. Besides, had he wished to slander Him, he would have said nothing about his
own cure, but would have mentioned and urged against Him the breach of the Sabbath. But
this is not the case, surely it is not; the words are words of great boldness and candor; he
pro claims his Benefactor no less than the blind man did. For what said he? “He made clay,
and anointed mine eyes” ( c. ix. 6 ); and so this man of whom we now speak, “It is Jesus
who made me whole.”</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay Him, because He
had done these things on the Sabbath day.” What then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”</p>
<p>When there was need to make excuse for the Disciples, He brought forward David their
fellow-servant, saying, “Have ye not read what David did when he was an hungered?” ( Matt.
xii. 2.) But when excuse was to be made for Himself, He betook Himself to the Father,
showing in two ways His Equality, by calling God His Father peculiarly,1011 and by doing
the same things which He did. “And wherefore did He not mention what took place at
Jericho1012 ?” Because He wished to raise them up from earth that they might no longer
attend to Him as to a man, but as to God, and as to one who ought to legislate: since had
He not been The Very Son and of the same Essence, the defense would have been worse
than the charge. For if a viceroy who had altered a royal law should, when charged with so
doing, excuse himself in this manner, and say, “Yea, for the king also has annulled laws,”
he would not be able to escape, but would thus increase the weight of the charge. But in this
instance, since the dignity is equal, the defense is made perfect on most secure grounds.
“From the charges,” saith He, “from which ye absolve God, absolve Me also.” And therefore
He said first, “My Father,” that He might persuade them even against their will to allow to
Him the same, through reverence of His clearly asserted Sonship.</p>
<p>If any one say, “And how doth the Father ‘work,’ who ceased on the seventh day from
all His works?” let him learn the manner in which He “worketh.” What then is the manner
of His working? He careth for, He holdeth1013 together all that hath been made. Therefore

when thou beholdest the sun rising and the moon running in her path, the lakes, and
fountains, and rivers, and rains, the course of nature in the seeds and in our own bodies and
those of irrational beings, and all the rest by means of which this universe is made up, then
learn the ceaseless working of the Father. “For He maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and
the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” ( Matt. v. 45.) And again; “If God
so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the fire1014” (
Matt. vi. 30 ); and speaking of the birds He said, “Your Heavenly Father feedeth them.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> In that place1015 then He did all on the Sabbath day by words only, and added
nothing more, but refuted their charges by what was done in the Temple and from their
own practice. But here where He commanded a work to be done, the taking up a bed, (a
thing of no great importance as regarded the miracle,1016 though by it He showed one point,
a manifest violation of the Sabbath,) He leads up His discourse to something greater, desiring
the more to awe them by reference to the dignity of the Father, and to lead them up to
higher thought. Therefore when His discourse is concerning the Sabbath, He maketh not
His defense as man only, or as God only, but sometimes in one way, sometimes in the other;
because He desired to persuade them both of the condescension of the Dispensation, and
the Dignity of His Godhead. Therefore He now defendeth Himself as God, since had He
always conversed with them merely as a man, they would have continued in the same low
condition. Wherefore that this may not be, He bringeth forward the Father. Yet the creation
itself “worketh” on the Sabbath, (for the sun runneth, rivers flow, fountains bubble, women
bear,) but that thou mayest learn that He is not of creation, He said not, “Yea, I work, for
creation worketh,” but, “Yea, I work, for My Father worketh.”</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had
broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.”</p>
<p>And this he asserted not by words merely, but by deeds, for not in speech alone, but
also yet oftener by actions He declared it. Why so? Because they might object to His words
and charge Him with arrogance, but when they saw the truth of His actions proved by results,
and His power proclaimed by works, after that they could say nothing against Him.</p>
<p>But they who will not receive these words in a right mind assert, that “Christ made not
Himself equal to God, but that the Jews suspected this.” Come then let us go over what has
been said from the beginning. Tell me, did the Jews persecute Him, or did they not? It is
clear to every one that they did. Did they persecute Him for this or for something else? It is
again allowed that it was for this. Did He then break the Sabbath, or did He not? Against
the fact that He did, no one can have anything to say. Did He call God His Father, or did
<note type="footnote">1014 εἰς κλίβανον, G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1015 Matt. xii</note>
<note type="footnote">1016 πρᾶγμα </note>

<pb n="269"/>
He not call Him so? This too is true. Then the rest also follows by the same consequence;
for as to call God His Father, to break the Sabbath, and to be persecuted by the Jews for the
former and more especially for the latter reason, belonged not to a false imagination, but
to actual fact, so to make Himself equal to God was a declaration of the same meaning. 1017</p>
<p>And this one may see more clearly from what He had before said, for “My Father worketh,
and I work,” is the expression of One declaring Himself equal to God. For in these
words He has marked1018 no difference. He said not, “He worketh, and I minister,” but,
“As He worketh, so work I”; and hath declared absolute Equality. But if He had not wished
to establish this, and the Jews had supposed so without reason, He would not have allowed
their minds to be deceived, but would have corrected this. Besides, the Evangelist would
not have been silent on the subject, but would have plainly said that the Jews supposed so,
but that Jesus did not make Himself equal to God. As in another place he doth this very
thing, when he perceiveth that something was said in one way, and understood in another;
as, “Destroy this Temple,” said Christ, “and in three days I will raise It up” ( c. ii. 19 );
speaking of His Flesh. But the Jews, not understanding this, and supposing that the words
were spoken of the Jewish Temple, said, “Forty and six years was this temple in building,
and wilt Thou rear it up in three days?” Since then He said one thing, and they imagined
another, (for He spake of His Flesh, and they thought that the words were spoken of their
Temple,) the Evangelist remarking on this, or rather correcting their imagination, goes on
to say, “But He spake of the Temple of His Body.” So that here also, if Christ had not made
Himself equal with God, had not wished to establish this, and yet the Jews had imagined
that He did, the writer would here also have corrected their supposition, and would have
said, “The Jews thought that He made Himself equal to God, but indeed He spake not of
equality.” And this is done not in this place only, nor by this Evangelist only, but again
elsewhere another Evangelist is seen to do the same. For when Christ warned His disciples,
saying, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees” ( Matt. xvi. 6 ), and they
reasoned among themselves, saying, “It is because we have taken no bread,” and He spake
of one thing, calling their doctrine “leaven,” but the disciples imagined another, supposing
that the words were said of bread; it is not now the Evangelist who setteth them right, but
Christ Himself, speaking thus, “How is it that ye do not understand, that I spake not to you
concerning bread?” But here there is nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>“But,” saith some one, “to remove this very thought Christ has added,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “‘The Son can do nothing of Himself.’”</p>
<note type="footnote">1017 τῆς αὐτῆς γνώμης ἀπόφασίς, i.e. in saying that He was making Himself “equal to the Father,” the
Evangelist asserts a truth which had before been signified by His breaking the Sabbath, and saying that God was
His Father.</note>
<note type="footnote">1018 al. “given.”</note>

<pb n="270"/>
<p>Man! He doth the contrary. He saith this not to take away, but to confirm,1019 His
Equality. But attend carefully, for this is no common question. The expression “of Himself”
is found in many places of Scripture, with reference both to Christ and to the Holy Ghost,
and we must learn the force of the expression, that we may not fall into the greatest errors;
for if one take it separately by itself in the way in which it is obvious to take it, consider how
great an absurdity will follow. He said not that He could do some things of Himself and that
others He could not, but universally,</p>
<p><del>4.</del> “The Son can do nothing of Himself.” I ask then my opponent, “Can the Son do
nothing of Himself, tell me?” If he reply, “that He can do nothing,” we will say, that He hath
done of Himself the very greatest of all goods. As Paul cries aloud, saying, “Who being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no
reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant.” ( Phil. ii. 6, 7.) And again, Christ
Himself in another place saith, “I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take
it again”: and, “No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.” ( c. x. 18.) Seest thou
that He hath power over life and death, and that He wrought of Himself so mighty a Dispensation?
And why speak I concerning Christ, when even we, than whom nothing can be
meaner, do many things of ourselves? Of ourselves we choose vice, of ourselves we go after
virtue, and if we do it not of ourselves, and not having power, we shall neither suffer hell if
we do wrong, nor enjoy the Kingdom if we do right.</p>
<p>What then meaneth, “Can do nothing of Himself”? That He can do nothing in opposition
to the Father, nothing alien from, nothing strange to Him,1020 which is especially the assertion
of One declaring an Equality and entire agreement.</p>
<p>But wherefore said He not, that “He doeth nothing contrary,” instead of, “He cannot
do”? It was that from this again He might show the invariableness and exactness of the
Equality, for the expression imputes not weakness to Him, but even shows1021 His great
power; since in another place Paul saith of the Father, “That by two immutable things in
which it was impos sible for God to lie” ( Heb. vi. 18 ): and again, “If we deny Him — He
abideth faithful,” for “He cannot deny Himself.” ( 2 Tim. ii. 12, 13.) And in truth this expression,
“impossible,” is not declaratory of weakness, but power, power unspeakable. For what
He saith is of this kind, that “that Essence admitteth not such things as these.” For just as
when we also say, “it is impossible for God to do wrong,” we do not impute to Him any
weakness, but confess in Him an unutterable power; so when He also saith, “I can of Mine
own Self do nothing” ( v. 30 ), His meaning is, that “it is impossible, nature admits not,1022
<note type="footnote">1019 lit. “to clench.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1020 i.e. nothing by Himself.</note>
<note type="footnote">1021 al. “testifies.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1022 ἀ νεγχώρητον</note>

<pb n="271"/>
that I should do anything contrary to the Father.” And that you may learn that this is really
what is said, let us, going over what follows, see whether Christ agreeth with what is said by
us, or among you. Thou sayest, that the expression does away with His Power and His
proper Authority, and shows His might to be but weak; but I say, that this proves His
Equality, His unvarying Likeness,1023 (to the Father,) and the fact that all is done as it were
by one Will1024 and Power and Might. Let us then enquire of Christ Himself, and see by
what He next saith whether He interpreteth these words according to thy supposition or
according to ours. What then saith He?</p>
<p>“For what things soever the Father1025 doeth these also doeth the Son likewise.”
Seest thou how He hath taken away your assertion by the root, and confirmed what is
said by us? since, if Christ doeth nothing of Himself, neither will the Father do anything of
Himself, if so be that Christ doeth all things in like manner to Him.1026 If this be not the
case, another strange conclusion will follow. For He said not, that “whatsoever things He
saw the Father do, He did,” but, “except He see the Father doing anything, He doeth it not”;
extending His words to all time; now He will, according to you, be continually learning the
same things. Seest thou how exalted is the idea, and that the very humility of the expression
compelleth even the most shameless and unwilling to avoid groveling thoughts, and such
as are unsuited to His dignity? For who so wretched and miserable as to assert, that the Son
learneth day by day what He must do? and how can that be true, “Thou art the same, and
Thy years shall not fail”? ( Ps. cii. 27 ), or that other, “All things were made by Him, and
without Him was not anything made” ( c. i. 3 ); if the Father doeth certain things, and the
Son seeth and imitateth Him? Seest thou that from what was asserted above, and from what
was said afterwards, proof is given of His independent Power? and if He bringeth forward
some expressions in lowly manner, marvel not, for since they persecuted Him when they
had heard His exalted sayings, and deemed Him to be an enemy of God, sinking1027 a little
in expression alone, He again leadeth His discourse up to the sublimer doctrines, then in
turn to the lower, varying His teaching that it might be easy of acceptance even to the indisposed.
1028 Observe, after saying, “My Father worketh, and I work”; and after declaring
Himself equal with God, He addeth, “The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth
the Father do.” Then again in a higher strain, “What things soever the Father doeth, these
also doeth the Son likewise.” Then in a lower,</p>

what I shall not cease to say, I will now repeat, that when He uttereth anything low or humbly,
He putteth it in excess, that the very poverty of the expression may persuade even the indisposed
to receive the notions with pious understanding. Since, if it be not so, see how absurd
a thing is asserted, making the trial from the words themselves. For when He saith, “And
shall show Him greater works than these,” He will be found not to have yet learned many
things, which cannot be said even of the Apostles; for they when they had once received the
grace of the Spirit, in a moment both knew and were able to do all things which it was
needful that they should know and have power to do, while Christ will be found to have not
yet learned many things which He needed to know. And what can be more absurd than
this?</p>
<p>What then is His meaning? It was because He had strengthened the paralytic, and was
about to raise the dead, that He thus spake, all but saying, “Wonder ye that I have
strengthened the paralyzed? Ye shall see greater things than these.” But He spake not thus,
but proceeded somehow in a humbler strain, in order that He might soothe1029 their madness.
And that thou mayest learn that “shall show” is not used absolutely, listen again to
what followeth.</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will.”</p>
<p>Yet “can do nothing of Himself” is opposed to “whom He will”: since if He quickeneth
“whom He will,” He can do something “of Himself,” (for to “will” implies power,) but if He
“can do nothing of Himself,” then He can not “quicken whom He will.” For the expression,
“as the Father raiseth up,” showeth unvarying resemblance in Power, and “whom He will,”
Equality of Authority. Seest thou therefore that “cannot do anything of Himself” is the expression
of One not taking away His (own) authority, but declaring the unvarying resemblance
of His Power and Will (to those of the Father)? In this sense also understand the words,
“shall show to Him”; for in another place He saith, “I will raise him up at the last Day.” ( c.
vi. 40.) And again, to show that He doth it not by receiving an inward power1030 from above,
He saith, “I am the Resurrection and the Life.” ( c. xi. 25.) Then that thou mayest not assert
that He raiseth what dead He will and quickeneth them, but that He doth not other things
in such manner, He anticipateth and preventeth every objection of the kind by saying, “What
things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise,” thus declaring that He doeth all
things which the Father doeth, and as the Father doeth them; whether thou speakest of the
<note type="footnote">1029 al. “heal.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1030 ἐ νεργείαν</note>

<pb n="273"/>
raising of the dead, or the fashioning1031 of bodies, or the remission of sins, or any other
matter whatever, He worketh in like manner to Him who begat Him.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But men careless of their salvation give heed to none of these things; so great an
evil is it to be in love with precedence. This has been the mother of heresies, this has confirmed
the impiety of the heathen.1032 For God desired that His invisible things should be
understood by the creation of this world ( Rom. i. 20 ), but they having left these and refused
to come by this mode of teaching, cut out for themselves another way, and so were cast out
from the true.1033 And the Jews believed not because they received honor from one another,
and sought not the honor which is from God. But let us, beloved, avoid this disease exceedingly
and with all earnestness; for though we have ten thousand good qualities, this plague
of vainglory is sufficient to bring them all to nought. ( c. v. 44.) If therefore we desire praise,
let us seek the praise which is from God, for the praise of men of what kind soever it be, as
soon as it has appeared has perished, or if it perish not, brings to us no profit, and often
proceeds from a corrupt judgment. And what is there to be admired in the honor which is
from men? which young dancers enjoy, and abandoned women, and covetous and rapacious
men? But he who is approved of God, is approved not with these, but with those holy men
the Prophets and Apostles, who have shown forth an angelic life. If we feel any desire to
lead multitudes about with us or be looked at by them, let us consider the matter apart by
itself, and we shall find that it is utterly worthless. In fine, if thou art fond of crowds, draw
to thyself the host of angels, and become terrible to the devils, then shalt thou care nothing
for mortal things, but shalt tread all that is splendid underfoot as mire and clay; and shall
clearly see that nothing so fits a soul for shame as the passion for glory; for it cannot, it
cannot be, that the man who desires this should live the crucified life, as on the other hand
it is not possible that the man who hath trodden this underfoot should not tread down most
other passions; for he who masters this will get the better of envy and covetousness, and all
the grievous maladies. “And how,” saith some one, “shall we get the better of it?” If we look
to the other glory which is from heaven, and from which this kind strives to cast us out. For
that heavenly glory both makes us honored here, and passes with us into the life which is
to come, and delivers us from all fleshly slavery which we now most miserably serve, giving
up ourselves entirely to earth and the things of earth. For if you go into the forum, if you
enter into a house, into the streets, into the soldiers’ quarters, into inns, taverns, ships, islands,
palaces, courts of justice, council chambers, you shall everywhere find anxiety for things
present and belonging to this life, and each man laboring for these things, whether gone or
coming, traveling or staying at home, voyaging, tilling lands, in the fields, in the cities, in a

word, all. What hope then of salvation have we, when inhabiting God’s earth we care not
for the things of God, when bidden to be aliens from earthly things we are aliens from
heaven and citizens of earth? What can be worse than this insensibility, when hearing each
day of the Judgment and of the Kingdom, we imitate the men in the days of Noah, and those
of Sodom, waiting to learn all by actual experience? Yet for this purpose were all those things
written, that if any one believe not that which is to come, he may, from what has already
been, get certain proof of what shall be. Considering therefore these things, both the past
and the future, let us at least take breath a little from this hard slavery, and make some account
of our souls also,1034 that we may obtain both present and future blessings; through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy
Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John v. 23, 24</p>
<p>“For My Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son; that all men
should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, we need great diligence in all things, for we shall render account of and
undergo a strict enquiry both of words and works. Our interests stop not with what now is,
but a certain other condition of life shall receive us after this, and we shall be brought before
a fearful tribunal. “For we must appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ, that every one
may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good
or bad.” ( 2 Cor. v. 10.) Let us ever bear in mind this tribunal, that we may thus be enabled
at all times to continue in virtue; for as he who has cast out from his soul that day, rushes
like a horse that has burst his bridle to precipices, (for “his ways are always defiled”1035 —
Ps. x. 5 ,) and then assigning the reason the Psalmist hath added, “He putteth Thy judgments
far away out of his sight”;) so he that always retains this fear will walk soberly. “Remember,”
saith one, “thy last things, and thou shalt never do amiss.” ( Ecclus. vii. 40.) For He who
now hath remitted our sins, will then sin in judgment; He who hath died for our sake will
then appear again to judge all mankind.1036 “Unto them that look for Him,” saith the Apostle,</p>
<p>“shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation.” ( Heb. ix. 28.) Wherefore in
this place also He saith, “My Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son; that all men should honor the Son; even as they honor the Father.”
“Shall we then,” saith some one, “also call Him Father?” Away with the thought. He
useth the word “Son” that we may honor Him still remaining a Son, as we honor the Father;
but he who calleth Him “Father” doth not honor the Son as the Father, but has confounded
the whole. Moreover as men are not so much brought to by being benefited as by being
punished, on this account He hath spoken thus terribly,1037 that even fear may draw them
to honor Him. And when He saith “all,” His meaning is this, that He hath power to punish
and to honor, and doeth either as He will.1038 The expression “hath given,” is used that thou
mayest not suppose Him not to have been Begotten, and so think that there are two Fathers.
For all that the Father is, this the Son is also,1039 Begotten, and remaining a Son. And that
<note type="footnote">1035 βεβηλοῦνται</note>

<note type="footnote">1039 al. “all things which belong to the Father, belong also to the Son.”</note>

<pb n="276"/>
thou mayest learn that “hath given” is the same as “hath begotten,” hear this very thing declared
by another place. “As,” saith Christ, “the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given
to the Son to have life in Himself.” ( Ver. 26.) “What then? Did he first beget and then give
Him life? For he who giveth, giveth to something which is. Was He then begotten without
life?” Not even the devils could imagine this, for it is very foolish as well as impious. As then
“hath given life” is “hath begotten Him who is Life,” so, “hath given judgment” is “hath begotten
Him who shall be Judge.”</p>
<p>That thou mayest not when thou hearest that He hath the Father for His cause imagine
any difference1040 of essence or inferiority of honor, He cometh to judge thee, by this
proving His Equality.1041 For He who hath authority to punish and to honor whom He will,
hath the same Power with the Father. Since, if this be not the case, if having been begotten
He afterwards received the honor, how came it that He was afterwards [thus] honored, by
what mode of advancement reached He so far as to receive and be appointed to this dignity?
Are ye not ashamed thus impudently to apply to that Pure1042 Nature which admitteth of
no addition these carnal and mean imaginations?</p>
<p>“Why then,” saith some one, “doth Christ so speak?” That His words may be readily
received, and to clear the way for sublime sayings; therefore He mixeth these with those,
and those with these. And observe how (He doth it); for it is good to see this from the beginning.
He said, “My Father worketh, and I work” ( c. v. 17 , U+0026c.): declaring by this their
Equality and Equal honor. But they “sought to kill Him.” What doth He then? He lowereth
His form of speech indeed, and putteth the same meaning when He saith, “The Son can do
nothing of Himself.” Then again He raiseth His discourse to high matters, saying, “What
things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.” Then He returneth to
what is lower, “For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself
doeth; and He will show Him greater things than these.” Then He riseth higher, “For as the
Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He
will.” After this again He joineth the high and the low together, “For neither doth the Father
judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son”; then riseth again, “That all men
should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.” Seest thou how He varieth the discourse,
weaving it both of high and low words and expressions, in order that it might be
acceptable to the men of that time, and that those who should come after might receive no
injury, gaining from the higher part a right opinion of the rest? For if this be not the case,
if these sayings were not uttered through condescension, wherefore were the high expressions
added? Because one who is entitled to utter great words concerning himself, hath, when he
<note type="footnote">1040 παραλλαγήν</note>
<note type="footnote">1041 al. “high Birth.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1042 ἀ κηράτῳ</note>

<pb n="277"/>
saith anything mean and low, this reasonable excuse, that he doth it for some prudential
purpose;1043 but if one who ought to speak meanly of himself saith anything great, on what
account doth he utter words which surpass his nature? This is not for any purpose at all,
but an act of extreme impiety.1044</p>
<p><del>2.</del> We are therefore able to assign a reason for the lowly expressions, a reason sufficient,
and becoming to God, namely, His condescension, His teaching us to be moderate, and the
salvation which is thus wrought for us. To declare which He said Himself in another place,
“These things I say that ye might be saved.” For when He left His own witness, and betook
Himself to that of John, (a thing unworthy of His greatness,) He putteth the reason of such
lowliness of language, and saith, “These things I say that ye might be saved.” And ye who
assert that He hath not the same authority and power with Him who begat Him, what can
ye say when ye hear Him utter words by which He declareth His Authority and Power and
Glory equal in respect of the Father? Wherefore, if He be as ye assert very inferior, doth He
claim the same honor? Nor doth He stop even here, but goeth on to say,</p>
<p>“He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which hath sent Him.” Seest
thou how the honor of the Son is connected with that of the Father? “What of that?” saith
one. “We see the same in the case of the Apostles; ‘He,’ saith Christ, ‘who receiveth you receiveth
Me.’” ( Matt. x. 40.) But in that place He speaketh so, because He maketh the concerns
of His servants His own; here, because the Essence and the Glory is One (with that of the
Father). Therefore1045 it is not said of the Apostles “that they may honor,” but rightly He
saith, “He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father.” For where there are two
kings, if one is insulted the other is insulted also, and especially when he that is insulted is
a son. He is insulted even when one of his soldiers is maltreated; not in the same way as in
this case, but as it were in the person of another,1046 while here it is as it were in his own.
Wherefore He beforehand said, “That they should honor the Son even as they honor the
Father,” in order that when He should say, “He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the
Father,” thou mightest understand that the honor is the same. For He saith not merely, “he
that honoreth not the Son,” but “he that honoreth Him not so as I have said” “honoreth not
the Father.”</p>
<p>“And how,” saith one, “can he that sendeth and he that is sent be of the same essence?”
Again, thou bringest down the argument to carnal things, and perceivest not that all this
has been said for no other purpose, but that we might know Him to be The Cause,1047 and

not fall into the error1048 of Sabellius, and that in this manner the infirmity of the Jews
might be healed, so that He might not be deemed an enemy of God;1049 for they said, “This
man is not of God” ( c. ix. 16 ), “This man hath not come from God.” Now to remove this
suspicion, high sayings did not contribute so much as the lowly, and therefore continually
and everywhere He said that He had been “sent”; not that thou mightest suppose that expression
to be1050 any lessening of His greatness, but in order to stop their mouths. And
for this cause also He constantly betaketh Himself to the Father, interposing moreover
mention of His own high Parentage.1051 For had He said all in proportion to His dignity,
the Jews would not have received His words, since because of a few such expressions, they
persecuted and oftentimes stoned Him; and if looking wholly to them He had used none
but low expressions, many in after times might have been harmed. Wherefore He mingleth
and blendeth1052 His teaching, both by these lowly sayings stopping, as I said, the mouths
of the Jews, and also by expressions suited to His dignity banishing1053 from men of sense
any mean notion of what He had said, and proving that such a notion did not in any wise
apply to Him at all.</p>
<p>The expression “having been sent” denoteth change of place—but God is everywhere
present. Wherefore then saith He that He was “sent”? He speaketh in an earthly1054 way,1055
declaring His unanimity with the Father. At least He shapeth His succeeding words with a
desire to effect this.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him
that sent Me, hath everlasting life.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how continually He putteth the same thing to cure that feeling of suspicion,
both in this place and in what follows by fear and by promises of blessings removing their
jealousy of Him, and then again condescending greatly in words? For He said not, “he that
heareth My words, and believeth on Me,” since they would have certainly deemed that to
be pride, and a superfluous pomp of words; because, if after a very long time, and ten
thousand miracles, they suspected this when He spake after this manner, much more would
they have done so then. It was on this account that at that later period1056 they said to Him,

“Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead, how sayest Thou,1057 If a man keep My saying,
he shall never taste of death?” ( c. viii. 52.) In order therefore that they may not here also
become furious, see what He saith, “He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that
sent Me, hath everlasting life.” This had no small effect in making His discourse acceptable,
when they learned that those who hear Him believe in the Father also; for after having received
this with readiness, they would more easily receive the rest. So that the very speaking
in a humble manner contributed and led the way to higher things; for after saying, “hath
everlasting life,” He addeth,</p>
<p>“And cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.”</p>
<p>By these two things He maketh His discourse acceptable; first, because it is the Father
who is believed on, and then, because the believer enjoyeth many blessings. And the “cometh
not into judgment” meaneth, “is not punished,” for He speaketh not of death “here,” but of
death eternal, as also of the other “life” which is deathless.</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead
shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that have heard shall live.”</p>
<p>Having said the words, He speaketh also of the proof by deeds.1058 For when He had
said, “As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth
whom He will,” that the thing may not seem to be mere boasting and pride, He affordeth
proof1059 by works, saying, “The hour cometh”; then, that thou mayest not deem that the
time is long, He addeth, “and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,
and they that have heard shall live.” Seest thou here His absolute and unutterable authority?
For as it shall be in the Resurrection, even so, He saith, it shall be “now.” Then too when we
hear His voice commanding us we are raised; for, saith the Apostle, “at the command of
God the dead shall arise.”1060 “And whence,” perhaps some one will ask, “is it clear that the
words are not mere boast?” From what He hath added, “and now is”; because had His
promises referred only to some future time, His discourse would have been suspected by
them, but now He supplieth them with a proof: “While I,” saith He, “am tarrying among
you, this thing shall come to pass”; and He would not, had He not possessed the power,
have promised for that time, lest through the promise He should incur the greater ridicule.
Then too He addeth an argument demonstrative of His assertions, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life
in Himself.”</p>

<p><del>3.</del> Seest thou that this declareth a perfect likeness save in one1061 point, which is the
One being a Father, and the Other a Son? for the expression “hath given,” merely introduceth
this distinction, but declareth that all the rest is equal and exactly alike. Whence it is clear
that the Son doeth all things with as much authority and power as the Father, and that He
is not empowered from some other source, for He “hath life” so as the Father hath. And on
this account, what comes after is straightway added, that from this we may understand the
other also. What is this then? It is,</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “Hath given Him authority to execute judgment also.”</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He continually1062 dwell upon “resurrection” and “judgment”?
For He saith, “As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will”: and again, “the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
judgment to the Son”: and again, “As the Father hath life in Himself so hath He given to the
Son to have life in Himself”; and again, “They that have heard [the Voice of the Son of God]
shall live”; and here again, “Hath given to Him authority to execute judgment.” Wherefore
doth He dwell on these things continually? I mean, on “judgment,” and “life,” and “resur-
rection”? It is because these subjects are able most of any to attract even the obstinate hearer.
For the man who is persuaded that he shall both rise again and shall give account to Christ1063
of his transgressions, even though he have seen no other sign, yet having admitted this, will
surely run to Him to propitiate his Judge.</p>
<p>“That He is the Son of Man ( v. 28 ), marvel not at this.”</p>
<p>Paul of Samosata rendereth it not so; but how? “Hath given Him authority to execute
judgment, ‘because’ He is the Son of Man.”1064 Now the passage thus read is inconsequent,
for He did not receive judgment “because” He was man, (since then what hindered all men
from being judges,) but because He is the Son of that Ineffable Essence, therefore is He
Judge. So we must read, “That He is the Son of Man, marvel not at this.” For when what He
said seemed to the hearers inconsistent, and they deemed Him nothing more than mere
man, while His words were greater than suited man, yea, or even angel, and were proper to
God only, to solve this objection He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 28, 29. “Marvel not [that He is the Son of Man,1065] for the hour is coming in the
which they1066 that are in the tombs shall hear His voice and shall go forth, they that have

done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of
judgment.”</p>
<p>And wherefore said He not, “Marvel not that He is the Son of Man, for He is also the
Son of God,” but rather mentioned the “resurrection”? He did indeed put this above, by
saying, “shall hear the Voice of the Son of God.” And if here He is silent on the matter,
wonder not; for after mentioning a work which was proper to God, He then permitteth His
hearers to collect from it that He was God, and the Son of God. For had this been continually
asserted by Himself, it would at that time have offended them, but when proved by the argument
of miracles, it rendered His doctrine less burdensome. So they who put together
syllogisms, when having laid down their premises1067 they have fairly1068 proved the point
in question, frequently do not draw the conclusion themselves, but to render their hearers
more fairly disposed, and to make their victory more evident, cause the opponent himself
to give the verdict, so that the by-standers may the rather agree with them when their opponents
decide in their favor. When therefore He mentioned the resurrection of Lazarus,
He spake not of the Judgment (for it was not for this that Lazarus arose); but when He spake
generally He also added, that “they that have done good shall go forth unto the resurrection
of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment.” Thus also John led
on his hearers by speaking of the Judgment, and that “he that believeth not on the Son, shall
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him” ( c. iii. 36 ): so too Himself led on
Nicodemus: “He that believeth on the Son,” He said to him, “is not judged, but he that believeth
not is judged already” ( c. iii. 18 ); and so here He mentioneth the Judgment-seat1069
and the punishment which shall follow upon evil deeds. For because He had said above,
“He that heareth My words and believeth on Him that sent Me,” “is not judged,” lest any
one should imagine that this alone is sufficient for salvation, He addeth also the result of
man’s life,1070 declaring that “they which have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection
of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment.” Since then
He had said that all the world should render account to Him, and that all at His Voice should
rise again, a thing new and strange and even now disbelieved by many who seem to have
believed, not to say by the Jews at that time, hear how He goeth to prove it, again condescending
to the infirmity of His hearers.</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “I can of Mine own self do nothing; as I hear I judge, and My judgment is just,
because I seek not Mine own will, but the will of Him1071 which sent Me.”</p>

<p>Although He had but lately given no trifling proof of the Resurrection by bracing1072
the paralytic; on which account also He had not spoken of the Resurrection before He had
done what fell little short of resurrection. And the Judgment He hinted at after He had
braced the body, by saying, “Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing
come unto thee”; yet still He proclaimed beforehand the resurrection of Lazarus and of the
world. And when He had spoken of these two, that of Lazarus which should come to pass
almost immediately, and that of the inhabited world which should be long after, He confirmeth
the first by the paralytic and by the nearness of the time, saying, “The hour cometh
and now is”; the other by the raising of Lazarus, by what had already come to pass bringing
before their sight what had not yet done so. And this we may observe Him do everywhere,
putting (forth) two or three predictions, and always confirming the future by the past.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Yet after saying and doing so much, since they still were very weak1073 He is not
content, but by other expressions calms their disputatious temper,1074 saying, “I can of
Myself do nothing; as I hear I judge, and My judgment is just, because I seek not Mine own
will, but the will of Him which sent Me.” For since He appeared to make some assertions
strange and varying from those of the Prophets, (for they said that it is God who judgeth all
the earth, that is, the human race; and this truth David everywhere loudly proclaimed, “He
shall judge the people in righteousness,” and, “God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient”
( Ps. xcvi. 10, and Ps. vii. 11 , LXX.); as did all the Prophets and Moses; but Christ said, “The
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son”:1075 an expression
which was sufficient to perplex a Jew who heard it, and to make him in turn suspect Christ
of being an enemy of God,) He here greatly condescendeth in His speech, and as far as their
infirmity requireth, in order to pluck up by the roots this pernicious opinion, and saith, “I
can of Myself do nothing”; that is, “nothing strange, or unlike,1076 or what the Father desireth
not will ye see done or hear said by Me.” And having before declared that He was “the Son
of Man,” and because they1077 supposed Him to be a man at that time, so also He putteth
[His expressions] here. As then when He said above, “We speak that we have heard, and
testify that we have seen”; and when John said, “What He hath seen He testifieth, and no
man receiveth His testimony” ( c. iii. 32 ); both expressions are used respecting exact
knowledge, not concerning hearing and seeing merely; so in this place when He speaketh
of “hearing,” He declareth nothing else than that it is impossible for Him to desire anything,

save what the Father desireth. Still He said not so plainly, (for they would not as yet have at
once received it on hearing it thus asserted;) and how? in a manner very condescending and
befitting a mere man, “As I hear I judge.” Again He useth these words in this place, not with
reference to “instruction,” (for He said not, “as I am taught,” but “as I hear”;) nor as though
He needed to listen, (for not only did He not require to be taught, but He needed not even
to listen;) but it was to declare the Unanimity and Identity of [His and the Father’s] decision,
as though He had said, “So I judge, as if it were the Father Himself that judged.” Then He
addeth, “and I know that My judgment is just, because I seek not Mine own will, but the
will of Him that sent Me.” What sayest Thou? Hast Thou a will different from that of the
Father? Yet in another place He saith, “As I and Thou are One,” (speaking of will and unanimity,)
“grant to these also that they may be one in Us” ( c. xvii. 21 ; not verbally quoted);
that is, “in faith concerning Us.” Seest thou that the words which seem most humble are
those which conceal a high meaning? For what He implieth is of this kind: not that the will
of the Father is one, and His own another; but that, “as one will in one mind, so is Mine
own will and My Father’s.”</p>
<p>And marvel not that He hath asserted so close a conjunction; for with reference to the
Spirit also Paul hath used this illustration: “What man knoweth the things of a man, save
the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God.” Thus Christ’s meaning is no other than this: “I have not a will different and
apart from that of the Father,1078 but if He desireth anything, then I also; if I, then He also.
As therefore none could object to the Father judging, so neither may any to Me, for the
sentence of Each1079 is given from the same Mind.” And if He uttereth these words rather
as a man, marvel not, seeing that they still deemed Him to be mere man. Therefore in passages
like these it is necessary not merely to enquire into the meaning of the words, but also to
take into account the suspicion of the hearers, and listen to what is said as being addressed
to that suspicion. Otherwise many difficulties will follow. Consider for instance, He saith,
“I seek not Mine own will”: according to this then His will is different (from that of the
Father), is imperfect, nay, not merely imperfect, but even unprofitable. “For if it be saving,
if it agree with that of the Father, wherefore dost Thou not seek it?” Mortals might with
reason say so because they have many wills contrary to what seemeth good to the Father,
but Thou, wherefore sayest Thou this, who art in all things like the Father? for this none
would say is the language even of a “man” made perfect and crucified. For if Paul so blended
himself1080 with the will of God as to say, “I live, yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in me” (
<note type="footnote">1078 According to Savile’s conjectural reading, παρὰ τὸ τοῦ Π. in place of παρὰ τοῦ Π. for which there is

<pb n="284"/>
Gal. ii. 20 ), how saith the Lord of all, “I seek not Mine own will, but the will of Him that
sent Me,” as though that will were different? What then is His meaning? He applieth1081
His discourse as if the case were that of a mere man, and suiteth His language to the suspicion
of His hearers. For when He had, by what had gone before, given proof of His sayings,
speaking partly as God, partly as a mere man, He again as a man endeavoreth to establish1082
the same, and saith, “My judgment is just.” And whence is this seen? “Because I seek not
Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.” “For as in the case of men, he that is free
from selfishness cannot be justly charged with having given an unfair decision, so neither
will ye now be able to accuse Me. He that desireth to establish his own, may perhaps by
many be suspected of corrupting justice with this intent; but he that looketh not to his own,
what reason can he have for not deciding justly? Apply now this reasoning to My case. Had
I said that I was not sent by the Father, had I not referred to Him the glory of what was done,
some of you might perhaps have suspected that desiring to gain honor for Myself, I said the
thing that is not; but if I impute and refer what is done to another, wherefore and whence
can ye have cause to suspect My words?” Seest thou how He confirmed His discourse, and
asserted that “His judgment was just” by an argument which any common man might have
used in defending himself? Seest thou how what I have often said is clearly visible? What is
that? It is that the exceeding humility of the expressions most persuadeth men of sense not
to receive the words off hand1083 and then fall down [into low thoughts], but rather to take
pains that they reach to the height of their meaning; this humility too with much ease then
raiseth up those who were once groveling on the ground.</p>
<p>Now bearing all this in mind, let us not, I exhort you, carelessly pass by Christ’s words,
but enquire closely into them all, everywhere considering the reason of what has been said;
and let us not deem that ignorance and simplicity will be sufficient to excuse us, for He hath
bidden us not merely to be “harmless,” but “wise.” ( Matt. x. 16.) Let us therefore practice
wisdom with simplicity, both as to doctrines and the right actions1084 of our lives; let us
judge ourselves here, that we be not condemned with the world hereafter;1085 let us act towards
our fellow-servants as we desire our Master to act towards us: for (we say), “Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” ( Matt. vi. 12.) I know that the smitten soul endureth
not meekly, but if we consider that by so doing we do a kindness not to him who hath grieved
us but to ourselves, we shall soon let go the venom of our wrath; for he who forgave not the
hundred pence to him who had transgressed against him, wronged not his fellow-servant

but himself, by rendering himself liable for the ten thousand talents of which he had before
received forgiveness. ( Matt. xviii. 30-34.) When therefore we forgive not others, we forgive
not ourselves. And so let us not merely say to God, “remember not our offenses”; but let
each also say to himself, “let us not remember the offenses of our fellow-servants done
against us.” For thou first givest judgment on thine own sins, and God judgeth after;1086
thou proposest the law concerning remission and punishment, thou declarest thy decision
on these matters, and therefore whether God shall or shall not remember, rests with thee.
For which cause Paul biddeth us “forgive, if any One hath cause of complaint against any”
( Col. iii. 13 ), and not simply forgive, but so that not even any remnants be left behind.
Since Christ not only did not publish our transgressions, but did not put us the transgressors
in mind of them, nor say, “in such and such things hast thou offended,” but remitted and
blotted out the handwriting, not reckoning our offenses, as Paul hath also declared. ( Col.
ii. 14.) Let us too do this; let us wipe away all [trespasses against us] from our minds; and if
any good thing hath been done to us by him that hath grieved us, let us only reckon that;
but if anything grievous and hard to bear, let us cast it forth and blot it out, so that not even
a vestige of it remain. And if no good has been done us by him, so much the greater recompense
and higher credit will be ours if we forgive. Others by watching, by making the earth
their bed, by ten thousand hardships, wipe away their sins, but thou by an easier way, I mean
by not remembering wrongs, mayest cause all thy trespasses to disappear. Why then
thrustest thou the sword against thyself, as do mad and frantic men, and banishest thyself
from the life which is to come, when thou oughtest to use every means to attain unto it? For
if this present life be so desirable, what can one say of that other from which pain, and grief,
and mourning, have fled away? There it needs not to fear death, nor imagine any end to
those good things. Blessed, thrice blessed, yea, and this many times over, are they who enjoy
that blessed rest, while they are miserable, thrice miserable, yea, ten thousand times miserable,
who have cast themselves forth from that blessedness. “And what,” saith some one, “is it
that maketh us to enjoy that life?” Hear the Judge Himself conversing with a certain young
man on this matter. When the young man said, “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” (
Matt. xix. 16 ) Christ, after repeating to him the other commandments, ended with the love
of his neighbor. Perhaps like that rich man some of my hearers will say, “that we also have
kept these, for we neither have robbed, nor killed, nor committed adultery”; yet assuredly
thou wilt not be able to say this, that thou hast loved thy neighbor as thou oughtest to have
loved him. For if a man hath envied or spoken evil of another, if he hath not helped him
when injured, or not imparted to him of his substance, then neither hath he loved him. Now
Christ hath commanded not only this, but something besides. What then is this? “Sell,” he
saith, “that thou hast, and give to the poor; and come, follow Me” ( Matt. xix. 21 ): terming
<note type="footnote">1086 ἕ πεται</note>

<pb n="286"/>
the imitating Him in our actions “following” Him. What learn we hence? First, that he who
hath not all these things cannot attain unto the chief places in “that” rest. For after the young
man had said, “All these things have I done,” Christ, as though some great thing were
wanting to his being perfectly approved, replied, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast,
and give to the poor: and come, follow Me.” First then we may learn this; secondly, that
Christ rebuked the man for his vain boast; for one who lived in such superfluity, and regarded
not others living in poverty, how could he love his neighbor? So that neither in this matter
did he speak truly. But let us do both the one and the other of these things; let us be eager
to empty out our substance, and to purchase heaven. Since if for worldly honor men have
often expended their whole possessions, an honor which was to stay here below, and even
here not to stay by us long, (for many even much before their deaths have been stripped of
their supremacy, and others because of it have often lost their lives, and yet, although aware
of this, they expend all for its sake;) if now they do so much for this kind of honor, what can
be more wretched than we if for the sake of that honor which abideth and which cannot be
taken from us we will not give up even a little, nor supply to others those things which in a
short time while yet here we shall leave? What madness must it be, when it is in our power
voluntarily to give to others, and so to take with us those things of which we shall even
against our will be deprived, to refuse to do so? Yet if a man were being led to death, and it
were proposed to him to give up all his goods and so go free, we should think a favor was
conferred upon him; and shall we, who are being led on the way to the pit, shall we, when
it is allowed us to give up half and be free, prefer to be punished, and uselessly to retain what
is not ours even to the losing what is so? What excuse shall we have, what claim for pardon,
who, when so easy a road has been cut for us unto life, rush down precipices, and travel
along an unprofitable path, depriving ourselves of all things both here and hereafter, when
we might enjoy both in security? If then we did not so before, let us at least stop now; and
coming to ourselves, let us rightly dispose of things present, that we may easily receive those
which are to come, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John v. 31, 32</p>
<p>“If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true; there is another that beareth witness of
Me, and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of Me is true.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> If any one unpracticed in the art undertake to work a mine, he will get no gold, but
confounding all aimlessly and together, will undergo a labor unprofitable and pernicious:
so also they who understand not the method1087 of Holy Scripture, nor search out its peculiarities1088
and laws, but go over all its points carelessly and in one manner, will mix the
gold with earth, and never discover the treasure which is laid up in it. I say this now because
the passage before us containeth much gold, not indeed manifest to view, but covered over
with much obscurity, and therefore by digging and purifying we must arrive at the legitimate
sense. For who would not at once be troubled at hearing Christ say, “If I testify of Myself,
My witness is not true”; inasmuch as He often appeareth to have testified of Himself? For
instance, conversing with the Samaritan woman He said, “I Am that speak unto thee”: and
in like manner to the blind man, “It is He that talketh with thee” ( c. ix. 37 ); and rebuking
the Jews, “Ye say,1089 thou blasphemest, because I said I am the Son of God.” ( c. x. 36.) And
in many other places besides He doth this. If now all these assertions be false, what hope of
salvation shall we have? And where shall we find truth when Truth Itself declareth, “My
witness is not true”? Nor doth this appear to be the only contradiction; there is another not
less than this. He saith farther on, “Though I bear witness of Myself, yet My witness is true”
( c. viii. 14 ); which then, tell me, am I to receive, and which deem a falsehood? If we take
them out thus [from the context] simply as they are said, without carefully considering the
person to whom nor the cause for which they are said, nor any other like circumstances,
they will both be falsehoods. For if His witness be “not true,” then this assertion is not true
either, not merely the second, but the first also. What then is the meaning? We need great
watchfulness, or rather the grace of God, that we rest not in the mere words; for thus the
heretics err, because they enquire not into the object of the speaker nor the disposition of
the hearers. If we add not these and other points besides, as times and places and the opinions
of the listeners, many absurd consequences will follow.</p>
<p>What then is the meaning?1090 The Jews were about to object to Him, “If thou bearest
witness1091 concerning thyself, thy witness is not true” ( c. viii. 13 ): therefore He spake
<note type="footnote">1087 lit. “consequence.”</note>

<note type="footnote">1091 σὺ μαρτυρεῖς, G. T.</note>

<pb n="288"/>
these words in anticipation; as though He had said, “Ye will surely say to Me, we believe
thee not; for no one that witnesseth of himself is readily1092 held trustworthy among men.”
So that the “is not true” must not be read absolutely, but with reference to1093 their suspicions,
as though He had said, “to you it is not true”; and so He uttered the words not looking
to His own dignity, but to their secret thoughts. When He saith, “My witness is not true,”
He rebuketh their opinion of Him, and the objection about to be urged by them against
Him; but when He saith, “Though I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true” ( c. viii. 14
), He declareth the very nature of the thing itself, namely, that as God they ought to deem
Him trustworthy even when speaking of Himself. For since He had spoken of the resurrection
of the dead, and of the judgment, and that he that believeth on Him is not judged, but cometh
unto life, and that He shall sit to require account of all men, and that He hath the same
Authority and Power with the Father; and since He was about again otherwise to prove
these things, He necessarily put their objection first. “I told you,” He saith, “that ‘as the
Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them, so the Son quickeneth whom He will’; I told
you that ‘the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son’; I told
you that men must ‘honor the Son as they honor the Father’; I told you that ‘he that honoreth
not the Son honoreth not the Father’; I told you that ‘he that heareth My words and believeth
them shall not see death, but hath passed from death unto life’ ( v. 24 ; not exactly quoted);
that My voice shall raise the dead, some now, some hereafter; that I shall demand account
from all men of their transgressions, that I shall judge righteously, and recompense those
who have walked uprightly.” Now since all these were assertions, since the things asserted
were important, and since no clear proof of them had as yet been afforded to the Jews but
one rather1094 indistinct, He putteth their objection first when He is about to proceed1095
to establish His assertions, speaking somewhat in this way if not in these very words:1096
“Perhaps ye will say, thou assertest all this, but thou art not a credible witness, since thou
testifiest of thyself.” First then checking their disputatious spirit by setting forth what they
would say, and showing that He knew the secrets of their hearts, and giving this first proof
of His power, after stating the objection He supplieth other proofs clear and indisputable,
producing three witnesses to what He said, namely, the works wrought by Him, the witness
of the Father, and the preaching of John. And He putteth first the less important witness of
John. For after saying, “There is another that beareth witness of Me, and I know that his
witness is true,” He addeth,</p>

<p>Ver. 33. “Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.”</p>
<p>Yet if Thy witness be not true, how sayest Thou, “I know that the testimony of John is
true, and that he hath borne witness to the truth”? and seest thou (O man) how clear it hence
is, that the expression, “My witness is not true,” was addressed to their secret thoughts?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “What then,” saith some one, “if John bare witness partially.”1097 That the Jews
might not assert this, see how He removeth this suspicion. For He said not, “John testified
of Me,” but, “Ye first sent to John, and ye would not have sent had ye not deemed him
trustworthy.” Nay, what is more, they had sent not to ask him about Christ, but about
himself, and the man whom they deemed trustworthy in what related to himself they would
much more deem so in what related to another. For it is, so to speak, the nature of us all not
to give so much credit to those who speak of themselves as to those who speak of others;
yet him they deemed so trustworthy as not to require even concerning himself any other
testimony. For they who were sent said not, “What sayest thou concerning Christ?” but,
“Who art thou? What sayest thou of thyself?” So great admiration felt they for the man.
Now to all this Christ made allusion by saying, “Ye sent unto John.” And on this account
the Evangelist hath not merely related that they sent, but is exact as to the persons sent
that1098 they were Priests and of the Pharisees, not common or abject persons, nor such as
might be corrupted or cheated, but men able to understand exactly what he said.</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “But I receive not testimony from man.”</p>
<p>“Why then hast Thou brought forward that of John?” His testimony was not the “testimony
of man,” for, saith he, “He that sent me to baptize with water, He said unto me.” ( c.
i. 33.) So that John’s testimony was the testimony of God; for having learned from Him he
said what he did. But that none should ask, “Whence is it clear that he learnt from God?”
and stop at this, He abundantly silences them by still addressing Himself to their thoughts.
For neither was it likely that many would know these things; they had hitherto given heed
unto John as to one who spake of himself, and therefore Christ saith, “I receive not testimony
from man.” And that the Jews might not ask, “And if Thou wert not about to receive the
testimony of man, and by it to strengthen Thyself, why hast Thou brought forward this
man’s testimony?” see how He correcteth this contradiction by what He addeth. For after
saying, “I receive not testimony from man,” He hath added,</p>
<p>“But these things I say, that ye may be saved.”</p>
<p>What He saith is of this kind; “I, being God, needed not the witness of John which is
man’s witness, yet because ye gave more heed to him, believe him more trustworthy than
any, ran to him as to a prophet, (for all the city was poured forth to Jordan,) and have not
believed on Me, even when working miracles, therefore I remind you of that witness of his.”

Ver. 35. “He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice
in his light.”</p>
<p>That they may not reply, “What if he did speak and we received him not,” He showeth
that they did receive John’s sayings: since they sent not common men, but priests and
Pharisees and were willing to rejoice;1099 so much did they admire the man, and at the same
time had nothing to say against his words. But the “for a season,” is the expression of one
noting their levity,1100 and the fact that they soon started away from him.</p>
<p>Ver. 36. “But I have greater witness than that of John.”</p>
<p>“For had ye been willing to admit faith according to the (natural) consequence of the
facts, I would have brought you over by My works more than he by his words. But since ye
will not, I bring you to John, not as needing his testimony, but because I do all ‘that ye may
be saved.’ For I have greater witness than that of John, namely, that from My works; yet I
do not merely consider how I may be made acceptable to you by credible evidence, but how
by that (of persons) known1101 to and admired by you.” Then glancing at them and saying
that they rejoiced for a season in his (John’s) light, He declared that their zeal was but temporary
and uncertain.1102</p>
<p>He called John a torch,1103 signifying that he had not light of himself, but by the grace
of the Spirit; but the circumstance which caused the absolute distinction1104 between
Himself and John, namely, that He was the Sun of righteousness, this He put not yet; but
merely hinting as yet at this He touched1105 them sharply, by showing that from the same
disposition which led them to despise John, neither could they believe in Christ. Since it
was but for a season that they admired even the man whom they did admire, and who, had
they not acted thus, would soon have led them by the hand to Jesus. Having then proved
them altogether unworthy of forgiveness, He went on to say, “I have greater witness than
that of John.” “What is that?” It is that from His works.</p>
<p>“For the works,” He saith, “which the Father hath given Me to finish, the same works
that I do bear witness of Me that the Father sent1106 Me.”</p>
<p>By this He reminded them of the paralytic restored, and of many other things. The

John’s friendship towards Him, (though indeed it was not in their power to say even this of
John, a man equal to the exact practice of wisdom,1107 and on this account admired by
them,) but the works could not even among the maddest of them admit this suspicion;
therefore He added this second testimony, saying, “The works which the Father hath given
Me to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of Me that the Father sent Me.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> In this place He also meeteth the accusation respecting the violation of the Sabbath.
For since those persons argued, “How can he be from God, seeing that he keepeth not the
Sabbath?” ( c. ix. 16 ), therefore He saith, “Which My Father hath given unto Me.” Yet in
truth, He acted with absolute power, but in order most abundantly to show that He doth
nothing contrary to the Father, therefore He hath put the expression of much inferiority.
Since why did He not say, “The works which the Father hath given Me testify that I am equal
to the Father”? for both of these truths were to be earned from the works, that He did
nothing contrary, and that He was equal to Him who begat Him; a point which He is establishing
elsewhere, where He saith, “If ye believe not Me, believe the works: that ye may know
and believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.”1108 ( c. x. 38.) In both respects,
therefore, the works bare witness to Him, that He was equal to the Father, and that He did
nothing contrary to Him. Why then said He not so, instead of leaving out the greater and
putting forward this? Because to establish this was His first object. For although it was a
far less thing to have it believed that He came from God, than to have it believed that God
was equal with Him, (for that belonged to the Prophets also,1109 but this never,) still He
taketh much pains as to the lesser point, as knowing that, this admitted,1110 the other would
afterwards be easily received. So that making no mention of the more important portion of
the testimony, He putteth1111 its lesser office, that by this they may receive the other also.
Having effected this, He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “And the Father Himself, which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me.”</p>
<p>Where did He “bear witness of” Him? In Jordan: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased” ( Matt. iii. 16 ); hear Him.1112 Yet even this needed proof. The testimony
of John then was clear, for they themselves had sent to him, and could not deny it. The
testimony from miracles was in like manner clear, for they had seen them wrought, and had
heard from him who was healed, and had believed; whence also they drew their accusation.

It therefore remained to give proof to the testimony of the Father. Next in order to effect
this, He added,</p>
<p>“Ye have neither heard His voice at any time”:</p>
<p>How then saith Moses, “The Lord spake, and Moses answered”? ( Ex. xix. 19 ); and
David, “He had heard a tongue which he knew not” ( Ps. lxxxi. 5 ); and Moses again, “Is
there any such people which hath ‘heard the voice of God’?” ( Deut. iv. 33.)</p>
<p>“Nor seen His shape.”</p>
<p>Yet Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, are said to have seen Him, and many others. What
then is that which Christ saith now? He guideth them by degrees to a philosophical doctrine,
showing that with God is neither voice nor shape, but that He is higher than such forms or
sounds like these. For as when He saith, “Ye have not heard His voice,” He doth not mean
that God doth indeed utter a voice, but one which cannot be heard; so when He saith, “Nor
seen His shape,” He doth not mean that God hath a shape though one invisible, but that
neither of these things belongeth to God. And in order that they might not say, “Thou art
a boaster, God spake to Moses only”; (this at least they did say, “We know that God spake
with Moses: as for this fellow, we know not whence He is”— c. ix. 29 ;) on this account He
spake as He did, to show that there is neither voice nor shape with God. “But why,” He saith,
“name I these things? Not only have ye ‘neither heard His voice nor seen His shape,’ but it
is not even in your power to assert that of which you most boast and of which you are all
most fully assured, namely, that ye have received and keep His commandments.” Wherefore
He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “And ye have not His word abiding in you.”</p>
<p>That is, the ordinances, the commandments, the Law, and the Prophets. For even if God
ordained these, still they are not with you, since ye believe not on Me. Because, if the Scriptures
everywhere say1113 that it is necessary to give heed to1114 Me, and yet ye believe not,
it is quite clear that His word is removed from you. Wherefore again He addeth,</p>
<p>“For whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not.”</p>
<p>Then that they may not argue, “How, if we have not heard His voice, hath He testified
unto thee?” He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 39. “Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me.”
Since by these the Father gave His testimony. He gave it indeed by Jordan also and in
the mount, but Christ bringeth not forward those voices; perhaps by doing so1115 He would
have been disbelieved;1116 for one of them, that in the mount, they did not hear, and the
<note type="footnote">1113 al. “teach.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1114 al. “believe.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1115 ἐ ντεύθεν</note>
<note type="footnote">1116 al. “they would have disbelieved them.”</note>

<pb n="293"/>
other they heard indeed, but heeded not. For this reason He referreth them to the Scriptures,
showing that from them cometh the Father’s1117 testimony, having first removed the old
grounds on which they used to boast, either as having seen God or as having heard His
voice. For as it was likely that they would disbelieve His voice, and picture to themselves
what took place on Sinai, after first correcting their suspicions on these points, and showing
that what had been done was a condescension, He then referreth them to the testimony of
the Scriptures.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> And from these too let us also, when we war against heretics, arm and fortify
ourselves. For “all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work” ( 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17 ); not that he may
have some and not others, for such a man is not “perfect.” For tell me what profit is it, if a
man pray continually, but give not liberal alms? or if he give liberal alms, but be covetous
or violent? or if he be not covetous nor violent, but (is liberal) to make a show before men,
and to gain the praise of the beholders? or if he give alms with exactness and according to
God’s pleasure, yet be lifted up by this very thing, and be highminded ? or if he be humble
and constant in fasting, but covetous, greedy of gain,1118 and nailed to earth, and one who
introduceth into his soul the mother of mischief? for the love of money is the root of all
evils.1119 Let us then shudder at the action, let us flee the sin; this hath made the world a
waste,1120 this hath brought all things into confusion, this seduceth us from the most blessed
service of Christ. “It is not possible,”1121 He saith, “to serve God and mammon.” For
mammon giveth commands contradictory to those of Christ. The one saith, “Give to them
that need”; the other, “Plunder the goods of the needy.” Christ saith, “Forgive them that
wrong thee”; the other, “Prepare snares against those who do thee no wrong.” Christ saith,
“Be merciful and kind”; mammon saith, “Be savage and cruel, and count the tears of the
poor as nothing”; to the intent that he may render the Judge stern to us in that day. For then
all our actions shall come1122 before our eyes, and those who have been injured and stripped
by us, shutting us out from all excuse. Since if Lazarus, who received no wrong from Dives,
but only did not enjoy any of his good things, stood forth at that time1123 as a bitter accuser
and allowed him not to obtain any pardon, what excuse, tell me, shall they have, who, besides

giving no alms of their own substance, seize that of others, and overthrow orphans’ houses?
If they who have not fed Christ when He hungered have drawn such fire upon their heads,
what consolation shall they enjoy who plunder what belongs not to them at all, who weave
ten thousand law-suits, who unjustly grasp the property of all men? Let us then cast out this
desire; and we shall cast it out if we think of those before us who did wrongfully, who were
covetous and are gone. Do1124 not others enjoy their wealth and labors while they lie in
punishment, and vengeance, and intolerable woes? And how can this be anything but extreme
folly, to weary and vex ourselves, that living we may strain ourselves with labor, and on our
departure hence undergo intolerable punishments and vengeances, when we might have
enjoyed ourselves here, (for nothing so much causeth pleasure as the consciousness of
almsgiving,1125) and departing to that place might have been delivered from all our woes,
and obtained ten thousand blessings? For as wickedness is wont to punish those who go
after it, even before (they arrive at) the pit, so also virtue, even before the (gift of) the Kingdom,
provides delights for those who here practice it, making them to live in company with
good hopes and continual pleasure. Therefore that we may obtain this, both here and in the
life to come, let us hold fast to good works, so shall we gain the future crown; to which may
we all reach through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and
with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p>John v. 39, 40</p>
<p>“Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which
testify of Me. And ye will not come to Me that ye might have [eternal1126 ] life.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, let us make great account of spiritual things, and not think that it is sufficient
for us to salvation to pursue them anyhow. For if in things of this life a man can gain
no great profit if he conduct them in an indifferent and chance way, much more will this
be the case in spiritual things, since these require yet greater attention. Wherefore Christ
when He referred the Jews to the Scriptures, sent them not to a mere reading, but a careful
and considerate1127 search; for He said not, “Read the Scriptures,” but, “Search the Scriptures.”
Since the sayings relating to Him required great attention, (for they had been concealed
from the beginning for the advantage of the men of that time,) He biddeth them now
dig down with care that they might be able to discover what lay in the depth below. These
sayings were not on the surface, nor were they cast forth to open view, but lay like some
treasure hidden very deep. Now he that searcheth for hidden things, except he seek them
with care and toil, will never find the object of his search. For which cause He said, “Search
the Scriptures, because in them ye think ye have eternal life.” He said not, “Ye have,” but
“ye think,” showing that they gained from them nothing great or high, expecting as they
did to be saved by the mere reading, without the addi tion of1128 faith. What He saith
therefore is of this kind: “Do ye not admire the Scriptures, do ye not think that they are the
causes of all life? By these I confirm My claims now, for they are they which testify of Me,
yet ye will not come to Me that ye may have eternal life.” It was thus with good reason that
He said, “ye think,” because they would not obey, but merely prided themselves on the bare
reading. Then lest owing to His very tender care He should incur among them the suspicion
of vainglory, and because He desired to be believed by them, should be deemed to be seeking
His own; (for He reminded them of the words of John, and of the witness of God, and of
His own works, and said all He could to draw them to Him, and promised them “life”;1129)
since, I say, it was likely that many would suspect that He spake these things from a desire
of glory, hear what He saith:</p>
<p>Ver. 41. “I receive not honor from men.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1126 not in G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1127 al. “inquisitive.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1128 al. “being destitute of.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1129 al. “and promised all those things so as to draw them to Himself.”</note>

<pb n="296"/>
<p>That is, “I need it not”: “My nature,” He saith, “is not of such a kind as to need the
honor which is from men, for if the sun can receive no addition from the light of a candle,
much farther am I from needing the honor which is from men.” “Why then,” asks some
one, “sayest thou these things, if thou needest it not?” “That ye may be saved.” This He
positively asserted above, and the same He implied here also, by saying, “that ye might have
life.” Moreover, He putteth another reason:</p>
<p>Ver. 42. “But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.”</p>
<p>For when under pretense of loving God they1130 persecuted Him because He made
Himself equal with God, and He knew that they would not believe Him, lest any one should
ask, “why speakest thou these words?” “I speak them,” He saith, “to convict you of this, that
it is not for the love of God that ye persecute Me, if it be so that He testifieth to Me both by
works and by the Scriptures. For as before this when ye deemed Me an enemy of God ye
drove Me away, so now, since I have declared these things, ye ought to have hastened to
Me, if ye had really loved. God. But ye love Him not. And therefore have I spoken these
words, to show that you are possessed with excessive pride, that you are vainly boasting and
shading over1131 your own enviousness.” And the same He proveth not by these things
only, but by those that should come to pass.</p>
<p>Ver. 43. “I am come in My Father’s name, and ye receive Me not; if another shall come
in his own name, him will ye receive.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Seest thou that He everywhere declareth that He hath been “sent,” that judgment
hath been committed to Him by the Father, that He can do nothing of Himself, in order
that He may cut off all excuse for their unfairness? But who is it that He here saith shall
come “in his own name”? He alludeth here to Antichrist, and putteth1132 an incontrovertible
proof of their unfairness. “For if as loving God ye persecute Me, much more ought this to
have taken place1133 in the case of Antichrist. For he will neither say that he is sent by the
Father, nor that he cometh according to his will, but in everything contrariwise, seizing like
a tyrant what belongeth not to him, and asserting that he is the very God over all, as Paul
saith, ‘Exalting himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, showing himself
that he is God.’ ( 2 Thess. ii. 4.) This is to ‘come in his own name.’ I do not so, but am come
in the Name of My Father.” That they received not One who said that He was sent of God,
was a sufficient proof that they loved not God; but now from the contrary of this fact, from
their being about to receive Antichrist, He showeth their shamelessness.1134 For when they
<note type="footnote">1130 al. “they often.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1131 al. “veiling.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1132 al. “whom also He putteth.”</note>

<pb n="297"/>
received not One who asserteth that He was sent by God, and are about to worship one who
knoweth Him not, and who saith that he is God over all, it is clear that their persecution
proceeded from malice and from hating God. On this account He putteth two reasons for
His words; and first the kinder one,1135 “That ye may be saved”; and, “That ye may have
life”: and when they would have mocked at Him, He putteth the other which was more
striking, showing that even although His hearers should not believe, yet that God was wont
always to do His own works. Now Paul speaking concerning Antichrist said prophetically,
that “God shall send them strong delusion,—that they all might be judged who believed not
the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” ( 2 Thess. ii. 11, 12.) Christ said not, “He
shall come”; but, “if He come,” from tenderness for His hearers; and because all their obstinacy1136
was not yet complete. He was silent as to the reason of His coming; but Paul, for
those who can understand, has particularly alluded to it. For it is he who taketh away all
excuse from them.</p>
<p>Christ then putteth also the cause of their unbelief, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the
honor that cometh from God only?”</p>
<p>Hence again He showeth that they looked not to the things of God, but that under this
pretense they desired to gratify private feeling, and were so far from doing this on account
of His glory, that they preferred honor from men to that which cometh from Him. How
then were they likely to entertain1137 such hostility towards Him1138 for a kind of honor
which they so despised, as to prefer to it the honor which cometh from men?</p>
<p>Having told them that they had not the love of God, and having proved it by what was
doing in His case, and by what should be in the case of Antichrist, and having demonstrated
that they were deprived of all excuse, He next bringeth Moses to be their accuser, going on
to say,</p>
<p>Ver. 45–47. “Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth
you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me;
for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe My words?”</p>
<p>What He saith is of this kind: “It is Moses1139 who has been insulted more than I1140
by your conduct towards Me, for ye have disbelieved him rather than Me.” See how in every
way He hath cast them out from all excuse. “Ye said that ye loved God when ye persecuted

<note type="footnote">1136 al. “wickedness.”</note>

Me; I have shown that ye did so from hatred of Him: ye say1141 that I break the Sabbath and
annul the Law; I have rid Me of this slander also: ye maintain1142 that ye believe in Moses
by what ye dare to do against Me; I on the contrary show that this is most to disbelieve in
Moses; for so far am I from opposing the Law, that he who shall accuse you is none other
than the man who gave you the Law.” As then He said of the Scriptures, in which “ye think
ye have eternal life,” so of Moses also He saith, “in whom ye trust”; everywhere conquering
them by their own weapons.</p>
<p>“And whence,” saith some one, “is it clear that Moses will accuse us, and that thou art
not a boaster? What hast thou to do with Moses? Thou hast broken the Sabbath which he
ordained that we should keep; how then should he accuse us? And how doth it appear that
we shall believe on another who cometh in his own name? All these assertions thou makest
without evidence.” Now in truth all these points are proved above. “For” (Christ would
reply) “since it is acknowledged that I came from God, both by the works, by the voice of
John, and by the testimony of the Father, it is evident that Moses will accuse the Jews.” For
what saith he? “If a man come doing miracles and leading you to God, and truly foretelling
things future, ye must hearken unto him with all readiness.” Now Christ had done all this.
He wrought miracles in very truth, He drew all men to God, and (so that He1143) caused
accomplishment to follow His predictions.1144</p>
<p>“But whence doth it appear that they will believe another?” From their hating Christ,
since they who turn aside from Him who cometh according to the will of God will, it is quite
plain, receive the enemy of God. And marvel not if He now putteth forward Moses, although
He said, “I receive not witness from man,” for He referreth them not to Moses, but to the
Scriptures of God. However, since the Scriptures terrified them less, He bringeth round His
discourse to the very person (of Moses), setting over against them their Lawgiver as their
accuser, thus rendering the terror more impressive;1145 and each of their assertions He refuteth.
Observe: they said that they persecuted Him through love for God, He showeth that
they did so through hating God; they said that they held fast to Moses, He showeth that they
acted thus because they believed not Moses. For had they been zealous for the law, they
ought to have received Him who fulfilled it; if they loved God they ought to have believed
One who drew them to Him, if they believed Moses they ought to have done homage to
One of whom Moses prophesied. “But” (saith Christ) “if Moses is disbelieved before My

<pb n="299"/>
coming, it is nothing unlikely that I, who am heralded by him, should be driven away by
you.” As then He had shown from their conduct towards Himself that they who admired
John (really) despised him, so now He showeth that they who thought that they believed
Moses, believed him not, and turneth back on their own head all that they thought to put
forward in their own behalf. “So far,” He saith, “am I from drawing you away from the Law,
that I call your Lawgiver himself to be your accuser.”</p>
<p>That the Scriptures testified of Him He declared, but where they testify He added not;
desiring to inspire them with greater awe, and to prompt them to search, and to reduce
them to the necessity of questioning. For had He told them readily and without their questioning,
they would have rejected the testimony; but now, if they gave any heed to His words,
they needed first of all to ask, and learn from Him what that testimony was.1146 On this
account He dealeth the more largely in assertions and threats, not in proofs only, that even
so He may bring them over by fear of what He saith; but they even so were silent. Such a
thing is wickedness; whatsoever a man say or do it is not stirred to move, but remaineth
keeping its peculiar venom.</p>
<p>Wherefore we must cast out all wickedness from our souls, and never more contrive
any deceit; for, saith one, “To the perverse God sendeth crooked paths” ( Prov. xxi. 8 , LXX.);
and, “The holy spirit of discipline1147 will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are
without understanding.” ( Wisd. i. 5.) For nothing maketh men so foolish as wickedness;
since when a man is treacherous, unfair,1148 ungrateful, (these are different forms of
wickedness,) when without having been wronged he grieves another, when he weaves deceits,
how shall he not exhibit an example of excessive folly? Again, nothing maketh men so wise
as virtue; it rendereth them thankful and fair-minded, merciful, mild, gentle, and candid;
it is wont to be the mother of all other blessings. And what is more understanding than one
so disposed? for virtue is the very spring and root of prudence, just as all wickedness hath
its beginning in folly. For, the insolent man and the angry become the prey of their respective
passions from lack of wisdom; on which account the prophet said, “There is no soundness
in my flesh: my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness” ( Ps. xxxviii. 3, 4
): showing that all sin hath its beginning in folly: and so the virtuous man who hath the fear
of God is more understanding than any; wherefore a wise man hath said, “The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” ( Prov. i. 7.) If then to fear God is to have wisdom, and
the wicked man hath not that fear, he is deprived of that which is wisdom indeed;—and
deprived of that which is wisdom indeed, he is more foolish than any. And yet many admire
the wicked as being able to do injustice and harm, not knowing that they ought to deem
<note type="footnote">1146 al. “to enquire even if He held His peace.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1147 σοφίας</note>

them wretched above all men, who thinking to injure others thrust the sword against
themselves;—an act of extremest folly, that a man should strike himself and not even know
that he doth so, but should think that he is injuring another while he is killing himself.
Wherefore Paul, knowing that we slay ourselves when we smite others, saith, “Why do ye
not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” ( 1 Cor.
vi. 7.) For the not suffering wrong consists in doing none, as also the not being ill-used in
not using others ill; though this assertion may seem a riddle to the many, and to those who
will not learn true wisdom. Knowing this, let us not call wretched or lament for those who
suffer injury or insult, but for such who inflict these things; these are they who have been
most injured, who have made God to be at war with them, and have opened the mouths of
ten thousand accusers, who are getting an evil reputation in the present life, and drawing
down on themselves severe punishment in the life to come. While those who have been
wronged by them, and have nobly borne it all, have God favorable to them, and all to condone
with, and praise, and entertain them. Such as these in the present life, shall enjoy an exceeding
good report, as affording the strongest example of true wisdom, and in the life to come shall
share the good things everlasting; to which may we all attain through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory,
now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vi. 1, 4</p>
<p>“After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, into the parts of1149 Tiberias. And a
great multitude followed Him, because they saw the1150 miracles which He did on them
that were diseased. And Jesus departed1151 into a mountain, and there sat with His disciples.
And the Passover of the Jews1152 was nigh.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, let us not contend with violent men, but learn1153 when the doing so brings
no hurt to our virtue to give place to their evil counsels; for so all their hardihood is checked.
As darts when they fall upon a firm,1154 hard, and resisting substance, rebound with great
violence on those who throw them, but when the violence of the cast hath nothing to oppose
it, it soon becometh weaker and ceaseth, so is it with insolent men; when we contend with
them they become the fiercer, but when we yield and give ground, we easily abate all their
madness. Wherefore the Lord when He knew that the Pharisees had heard “that Jesus made
and baptized more disciples than John,” went into Galilee, to quench their envy, and to
soften by His retirement the wrath which was likely to be engendered by these reports. And
when He departed for the second time into Galilee, He cometh not to the same places as
before; for He went not to Cana, but to “the other side of the sea,” and1155 great multitudes
followed Him, beholding “the miracles which He did.” What miracles? Why doth he1156
not mention them specifically? Because this Evangelist most of all was desirous of employing
the greater part of his book on the discourses and sermons [of Christ]. Observe, for instance,
how for a whole year, or rather how even now at the feast of the Passover, he hath given us
no more information on the head of miracles, than merely that He healed the paralytic and
the nobleman’s son. Because he was not anxious to enumerate them all, (that would have
been impossible,) but of many and great to record a few.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “A great multitude followed Him beholding the miracles that He did.” What is
here told marks not a very wise state of mind;1157 for when they had enjoyed such teaching,

they still were more attracted by the miracles, which was a sign of the grosser state. For
“miracles,” It saith, “are not for believers, but for unbelievers.”1158 The people described by
Matthew acted not thus,1159 but how? They all, he saith “were astonished at His doctrine,
because He taught as one having authority.” ( Matt. vii. 28, 29.)</p>
<p>“And why doth He occupy the mountain now, and sit there with His disciples?” Because
of the miracle which was about to take place. And that the disciples alone went up with Him,
was a charge against the multitude which followed Him not. Yet not for this only did He
go up into the mountain, but to teach us ever to rest at intervals from the tumults and confusion
of common life.1160 For solitude is a thing meet for the study of wisdom. And often
doth He go up alone into a mountain, and spend the night there, and pray, to teach us that
the man who will come most near to God must be free from all disturbance, and must seek
times and places clear of confusion.</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “And the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.”</p>
<p>“How then,” saith some one, “doth He not go up unto the feast, but, when all are
pressing to Jerusalem, goeth Himself into Galilee, and not Himself alone, but taketh His
disciples with Him, and proceedeth thence to Capernaum?” Because henceforth He was
quietly annulling the Law, taking occasion from the wickedness of. the Jews.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “And as He lifted up His eyes, He beheld a great company.”1161</p>
<p>This showeth that He sat not at any time idly1162 with the disciples, but perhaps carefully
conversing with them, and making them attend1163 and turn towards Him, a thing which
peculiarly marks1164 His tender care, and the humility and condescension of His demeanor
towards them. For they sat with Him, perhaps looking at one another; then having lifted up
His eyes, He beheld the multitudes coming unto Him. Now the other Evangelists say, that
the disciples came and asked and besought Him that He would not send them away fasting,
while St. John saith, that the question was put to Philip by Christ. Both occurrences seem
to me to be truly reported, but not to have taken place at the same time, the former account
being prior to the other, so that the two are entirely different.</p>
<p>Wherefore then doth He ask “Philip”? He knew which of His disciples needed most
instruction; for this is he who afterwards said, “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us” ( c.

xiv. 8 ), and on this account Jesus was beforehand bringing him into a proper state.1165 For
had the miracle simply been done, the marvel would not have seemed so great, but now He
beforehand constraineth him to confess the existing want, that knowing the state of matters
he might be the more exactly acquainted with the magnitude of the miracle about to take
place. Wherefore He saith,1166</p>
<p>“Whence shall we have so many loaves,1167 that these may eat?”</p>
<p>So in the Old [Testament] He spake to Moses, for He wrought not the sign until He had
asked him, “What is that in thy hand?” Because things coming to pass unexpectedly and all
at once,1168 are wont to throw us into forgetfulness of things previous, therefore He first
involved him in a confession of present circumstances, that when the astonishment should
have come upon him, he might be unable afterwards to drive away the remembrance of
what he had confessed, and thus might learn by comparison the greatness of the miracle,
which in fact takes place in this instance; for Philip being asked, replied,</p>
<p>Ver. 7, 6. “Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one
of them may take a little. And this He said to prove him: for He Himself knew what He
would do.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What meaneth, “to prove him”? Did not He know what would be said by him? We
cannot assert that. What then is the meaning of the expression? We may discover it from
the Old [Testament]. For there too it is said, “And it came to pass after these things that
God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Take thy beloved son whom thou lovest” (
Gen. xxii. 1, 2 ); yet it doth not appear in that place either, that when He saith this He waited
to see the end of the trial, whether Abraham would obey or not, (how could He, who knoweth
all things before they come into existence?1169 but the words in both cases are spoken after
the manner of men. For as when (the Psalmist1170) saith that He “searcheth the hearts of
men,” he meaneth not a search of ignorance but of exact knowledge, just so when the
Evangelist saith that He proved (Philip), he meaneth only that He knew exactly. And perhaps
one might say another thing, that as He once made Abraham more approved, so also did
He this man, bringing him by this question to an exact knowledge of the miracle. The
Evangelist therefore, that thou mayest not stop at the feebleness of the expression, and so
form an improper opinion of what was said, addeth, “He Himself knew what He would do.”</p>

<p>Moreover we must observe this, that when there is any wrong suspicion, the writer
straightway very carefully corrects1171 it. As then in this place that the hearers might not
form any such suspicion, he adds the corrective, saying, “For He Himself knew what He
would do”: so also in that other place, when He saith, that “the Jews persecuted Him, because
He not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was His Father, making Himself
equal with God,” had there not been the assertion of Christ Himself confirmed by His works,
he would there also have subjoined this correction. For if even in words which Christ
speaketh the Evangelist is careful that none should have suspicions, much more in cases
where others were speaking of Him would he have looked closely, had he perceived that an
improper opinion prevailed concerning Him. But he did not so, for he knew that this1172
was His meaning,1173 and immovable decree.1174 Therefore after saying, “making Himself
equal with God,” he used not any such correction; for the matter spoken of was not an erroneous
fancy of theirs, but His own assertion ratified by His works. Philip then having been
questioned,</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. “Andrew, Simon’s1175 brother, said, There is a lad here, which hath five barley
loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?”</p>
<p>Andrew is higher minded than Philip, yet had not he attained to everything. Yet I do
not think that he spake without an object, but as having heard1176 of the miracles of the
Prophets, and how Elisha wrought a sign with the loaves ( 2 Kings iv. 43 ); on this account
he mounted to a certain height,1177 but could not attain to the very top.</p>
<p>Let us learn then,1178 we who give ourselves to luxury, what was the fare of those great
and admirable men; and in quality and quantity1179 let us behold and imitate the thriftiness
of their table.</p>
<p>What follows also expresses great weakness. For after saying, “hath five barley loaves,”
he addeth, “but what are they among so many?” He supposed that the Worker of the miracle
would make less out of less, and more out of more. But this was not the case, for it was alike
easy to Him to cause bread to spring forth1180 from more and from less, since He needed

no subject-matter. But in order that the creation might not seem foreign to His Wisdom,
as afterwards slanderers and those affected with the disease of Marcion1181 said, He used
the creation itself as a groundwork for His marvels.</p>
<p>When both the disciples had owned themselves at a loss, then He wrought the miracle;
for thus they profited the more, having first confessed the difficulty of the matter, that when
it should come to pass, they might understand the power of God. And because a miracle
was about to be wrought, which had also been performed by the Prophets, although not in
an equal degree, and because He would do it after first giving thanks, lest they should fall
into any suspicion of weakness on His part, observe how by the very manner of His working
He entirely raiseth their thoughts of it and showeth them the difference (between Himself
and others). For when the loaves had not yet appeared,1182 that thou mayest learn, that
things that are not are to Him as though they were, (as Paul saith, “who calleth the things
that be not as though they were”— Rom. iv. 17 ,) He commanded them as though the table
were prepared and ready, straightway to sit down, rousing by this the minds of His disciples.
And because1183 they had profited by the questioning, they immediately obeyed, and were
not confounded, nor said, “How is this, why dost Thou bid us sit down, when there is
nothing before us?” The same men, who at first disbelieved so much as to say, “Whence
shall we buy bread?” began so far to believe even before they saw the miracle,1184 that they
readily made the multitudes to sit down.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But why when He was about to restore the paralytic did He not pray, nor when He
was raising the dead, or bridling the sea, while He doth so here over the loaves? It was to
show that when we begin our meals, we ought to give thanks unto God. Moreover, He doth
it especially in a lesser matter, that thou mayest learn that He doth it not as having any need;
for were this the case, much more would He have done so in greater things; but when He
did them by His own authority, it is clear that it was through condescension that He acted
as He did in the case of the lesser. Besides, a great multitude was present, and it was necessary
that they should be persuaded that He had come according to the will of God. Wherefore,
when He doth miracles in the absence of witnesses, He exhibiteth nothing of the kind; but
when He doth them in the presence of many, in order to persuade them that He is no enemy
of God, no adversary of Him who hath begotten Him, He removeth the suspicion by
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“And He gave to them that were set down, and they were filled.”1185</p>
<p>Seest thou how great is the interval between the servants and the Master? They having
grace by measure, wrought their miracles accordingly, but God, who acteth with free power,
did all most abundantly.</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “And He said1186 unto His disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain;1187
—and they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets.”</p>
<p>This was not a superfluous show, but in order that the matter might not be deemed a
mere illusion; and for this reason He createth1188 from matter already subsisting. “But why
gave He not the bread to the multitudes to bear, but (only) to His disciples?” Because He
was most desirous to instruct these who were to be the teachers of the world. The multitude
would not as yet reap any great fruit from the miracles, (at least they straightway forgot this
one and asked for another,) while these would gain no common profit. And what took place
was moreover no ordinary condemnation of Judas, who bore a basket. And that these things
were done for their instruction is plain from what is said afterwards, when He reminded
them, saying, “Do ye not yet understand—how many baskets ye took up?” ( Matt. xvi. 9.)
And for the same reason it was that the baskets of fragments were equal in number to the
disciples; afterwards, when they were instructed, they took not up so many, but only “seven
baskets.” ( Matt. xv. 37.) And I marvel not only at the quantity of loaves created, but besides
the quantity, at the exactness of the surplus, that He caused the superabundance to be neither
more nor less than just so much as He willed, foreseeing how much they would consume;
a thing which marked unspeakable power. The fragments then confirmed the matter,
showing both these points; that what had taken place1189 was no illusion, and that these
were from the loaves by which the people had been fed. As to the fishes, they at this time
were produced from those already subsisting, but at a later period, after the Resurrection,
they were not made from subsisting matter. “Wherefore?” That thou mayest understand
that even now He employed matter, not from necessity, nor as needing any base1190 (to
work upon), but to stop the mouths of heretics.1191</p>

<p>“And the multitudes said, that this is of a truth The Prophet.”1192</p>
<p>Oh, excess of gluttony! He had done ten thousand things more admirable than this, but
nowhere did they make this confession, save when they had been filled. Yet hence it is
evident that they expected some remarkable prophet; for those others had said (to John),
“Art thou that Prophet?”1193 while these say, “This is that Prophet.”</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force
to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain.”1194</p>
<p>Wonderful! How great is the tyranny of gluttony, how great the fickleness of men’s
minds! No longer do they vindicate the Law, no longer do they care for the violation1195 of
the Sabbath, no longer are they zealous for God; all such considerations are thrown aside,
when their bellies have been filled; He was a prophet in their eyes, and they were about to
choose Him for a king. But Christ fleeth. “Wherefore?” To teach us to despise worldly dignities,
and to show us that He needed nothing on earth. For He who chose1196 all things
mean, both mother and house and city and nurture and attire would not afterwards be made
illustrious by things on earth. The things which (He had) from heaven were glorious and
great, angels, a star, His Father loudly speaking,1197 the Spirit testifying, and Prophets
proclaiming Him from afar; those on earth were all mean, that thus His power might the
more appear. He came also to teach us to despise the things of the world, and not be amazed
or astonished by the splendors of this life, but to laugh them all to scorn, and to desire those
which are to come. For he who admires things which are here, will not admire those in the
heavens. Wherefore also He saith to Pilate, “My Kingdom is not of this world” ( c. xviii. 36
), that He may not afterwards appear to have employed mere human terror or dominion
for the purpose of persuasion. Why then saith the Prophet, “Behold, thy King cometh unto
thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass”? ( Zech. ix. 9.) He spake of that Kingdom which is in
the heavens, but not of this on earth; and on this account Christ saith, “I receive not honor
from men.” ( c. v. 41.)</p>
<p>Learn we then, beloved, to despise and not to desire the honor which is from men; for
we have been honored with the greatest of honors, compared with which that other is verily1198
insult, ridicule, and mockery. And as the riches of this world compared with the

riches of that are poverty, as this life apart from that is deadness,1199 (for “let1200 the dead
bury their dead”— Matt. viii. 28 ,) so this honor compared with that is shame and ridicule.
Let us then not pursue it. If they who confer it are of less account than a shadow or a dream,
the honor itself much more so. “The glory of man is as the flower of the grass” ( 1 Pet. i. 24
); and what is meaner than the flower of the grass? Were this glory everlasting, in what could
it profit the soul? In nothing. Nay, it very greatly injures us by making us slaves, slaves in
worse condition than those bought with money, slaves who obey not one master only, but
two, three, ten thousand, all giving different commands. How much better is it to be a free
man than a slave, to be free from the slavery of men, and subject only to the dominion of
God? In a word, if thou wilt desire glory, desire it, but let it be the glory immortal, for that
is exhibited on a more glorious stage, and brings greater profit. For1201 the men here bid
thee be at charges to please them, but Christ, on the contrary, giveth thee an hundredfold
for what thou givest Him, and addeth moreover eternal life. Which of the two then is better,
to be admired1202 on earth, or in heaven? by man, or by God? to your loss, or to your gain?
to wear a crown for a single day, or for endless ages? Give to him that needeth, but give not
to a dancer, lest thou lose thy money and destroy his soul. For thou art the cause of his
(coming to) perdition through unseasonable munificence.1203 Since did those on the stage
know that their employment would be unprofitable, they would have long ago ceased to
practice it; but when they behold thee applauding, crowding after them, spending and
wasting thy substance upon them, even if they have no desire to follow (their profession),
they are kept to it by the desire of gain. If they knew that no one would praise what they do,
they would soon desist from their labors, by reason of their unprofitableness; but when they
see that the action is admired by many, the praise of others becomes a bait to them. Let us
then desist from this unprofitable expense, let us learn upon whom and when we ought to
spend. Let us not, I implore you, provoke God in both ways, gathering whence we ought
not, and scattering where we ought not; for what anger doth not thy conduct deserve, when
thou passest by the poor and givest to a harlot? Would not the paying the hire of sin and
the bestowing honor where it were meet to punish have been a charge against thee, even
hadst thou paid out of thy just earnings? but when thou feedest thine uncleanness by stripping
orphans and wronging widows, consider how great a fire is prepared for those who dare
such things. Hear what Paul saith, “Who not only do these things, but also have pleasure
in1204 them that do them.” ( Rom. i. 32.)</p>

<p>Perhaps we have touched you sharply, yet if we touch you not, there are actual1205
punishments awaiting those who sin without amendment. What then availeth it to gratify
by words those who shall be punished by realities? Dost thou take pleasure1206 at a dancer,
dost thou praise and admire him? Then art thou worse than he; his poverty affords him an
excuse though not a reasonable one, but thou art stripped even of this defense. If I ask him,
“Why hast thou left other arts and come to this accursed and impure one?” he will reply,
“because I can with little labor gain great profits.” But if I ask thee why thou admirest one
who spends his time in impurity, and lives to the mischief of many, thou canst not run to
the same excuse, but must bow down thy face and be ashamed and blush. Now if when
called by us to give account, thou wouldest have nothing to reply,1207 when that terrible
and inexorable Judgment cometh where we shall render account of thoughts and deeds and
everything, how shall we stand? with what eyes shall we behold our Judge? what shall we
say? what defense shall we make? what excuse reasonable or unreasonable shall we put forward?
shall we allege the expense? the gratification? the perdition of others whom by means
of his art we ruin? We can have nothing to say, but must be punished with a punishment
having no end, knowing no limit. That this come not to pass, let us henceforth guard all
points, that having departed with a good hope, we may obtain the everlasting blessings; to
which may we all attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom and with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vi. 16–18</p>
<p>“And when even was now come, His disciples went down unto1208 the sea and entered1209
into a ship, and went over1210 the sea toward Capernaum. And it was1211 now dark, and
Jesus was not come unto them. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Christ provideth for the good of his disciples not only when He is present in the
body, but also when far away; for having abundance of means and of skill, He effecteth one
and the same end by contrary actions. Observe, for instance, what He hath done here. He
leaveth His disciples, and goeth up into a mountain; and they,1212 when even was come,
went down unto the sea. They waited for Him until evening, expecting that He would come
unto them; but when even was come, they could no longer endure not to seek their Master;
1213 so great a love possessed them. They said not, “It is now evening, and night hath
overtaken us, whither shall we depart? the place is dangerous, the time unsafe”; but,
goaded1214 by their longing, they entered into the ship. For it is not without a cause that
the Evangelist hath declared1215 the time also, but by it to show the warmth of their love.</p>
<p>Wherefore then doth Christ let them go, and not show Himself?1216 And again,1217
wherefore doth He show Himself walking alone upon the sea? By the first He teacheth them
how great (an evil) it is to be forsaken by Him, and maketh their longing greater; by the
second, again, He showeth forth His power. For as in His teaching they heard not all in
common with the multitude, so in the case of the miracles they saw them not all with the
mass of people, since it was needful that they who were about to receive in charge the presidency
1218 of the world, should have somewhat more than the rest. “And what sort of
miracles,” saith some one, “saw they by themselves?” The Transfiguration on the mount;
this on the sea, and those after the Resurrection, which are many and important. And from

these I conjecture that there were others also. They came to Capernaum without any certain
information, but expecting to find Him there, or even in mid passage; this the Evangelist
implies by saying that “it was now dark, and Jesus was not yet come to them.”</p>
<p>“And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.” What did they? They were
troubled, for there were many and various causes which forced them to be so. They were
afraid by reason of the time for it was dark, of the storm for the sea had risen, of the place
for they were not near land; but,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Had rowed about five and twenty1219 furlongs.”</p>
<p>And, lastly, by reason of the strangeness of the thing, for,</p>
<p>“They see Him1220 walking upon the sea.” And when they were greatly troubled,</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “He saith unto them, It is I, be not afraid.”</p>
<p>Wherefore then appeareth He? To show that it was He who would make the storm
cease. For this the Evangelist hath shown, saying,1221</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “They were willing to receive Him,1222 and immediately the ship was near the
land.”1223</p>
<p>He not only gave them a safe passage, but also one with a fair wind.</p>
<p>To the multitude He showeth not Himself walking upon the sea, for the miracle was
too great to suit their infirmity. Indeed, even by the disciples He was not seen long doing
this, but He appeared, and at once retired.1224 Now this seems to me to be a different miracle
from that found in Matthew xiv.; and that it is different is clear from many reasons. For He
worketh often the same miracles, in order to cause the beholders not merely to count them
very strange,1225 but also to receive them with great faith.</p>
<p>“It is I, be not afraid.” As He spake the word, He cast out fear from their souls. But at
another time not so; wherefore Peter said, “Lord, if it be Thou, bid me to come unto Thee.”
( Matt. xiv. 28.) Whence then was it that at that time they did not straightway admit this,1226
but now were persuaded? It was because then the storm continued to toss the bark, but now
at His voice the calm had come. Or if the reason be not this, it is that other which I have
before mentioned, that oftentimes working the same miracles, He made the second to be
readily received by means of the first. But wherefore went He not up into the ship? Because

He would make the marvel greater, would more openly1227 reveal to them His Godhead,
and would show them, that when He before gave thanks, He did not so as needing aid, but
in condescension to them. He allowed the storm to arise, that they might ever seek Him;
He stilled the storm, that He might make known to them His power; He went not up into
the ship, that He might make the marvel greater.</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “And the people that were there saw that there was none other boat there save
the one into which the disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not into the boat, but His
disciples.”1228</p>
<p>And why is John so exact? Why said he not that the multitudes having passed over on
the next day departed?1229 He desires to teach us something else, namely, that Jesus allowed
the multitudes if not openly, at least in a secret manner, to suspect what had taken place.
For, “They saw,” saith he, “that there was none other boat there but one, and that Jesus went

<p>Ver. 24. And embarking in boats from Tiberias, they “came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.”</p>
<p>What else then could they suspect, save that He had arrived there crossing the sea on
foot? for it was not possible to say that He had passed over in another ship. For “there was
one,” saith the Evangelist, “into which His disciples entered.” Still when they came to Him
after so great a wonder, they asked Him not how He crossed over, how He arrived there,
nor sought to understand so great a sign. But what say they?</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “Master, when camest Thou hither?”</p>

But it is1230 worth while also to notice here the fickleness of their impulses1231 For they
who said, “This is that Prophet”; they who were anxious to “take Him and make Him a
king,” now when they have found Him take no such counsel, but having cast out their astonishment,
they no longer admire Him for His former deeds. They sought Him, desiring
again to enjoy a table like the first.</p>

<p>The Jews under the guidance of Moses passed over the Red Sea, but that case is widely
different from this. He did all with prayer and as a servant, but Christ with absolute1232
power. There when the south wind1233 blew, the water yielded so as to make them pass over
on dry land, but here the miracle was greater. ( Ex. xiv. 21.) For the sea retaining its proper
nature so bare its Lord upon its surface,1234 thus testifying to the Scripture which saith,
“Who walketh upon the sea as upon a pavement.” ( Job ix. 8.)</p>
<p>And with reason, when He was about to enter into stubborn and disobedient Capernaum,
did He work the miracle of the loaves, as desiring not only by what took place within, but
also by the miracles which were wrought without the city, to soften its disobedience. For
was it not enough to soften even any stone, that such multitudes should come with great
eagerness to that city? Yet they had no such feeling, but again desired food for the body; for
which also they are reproached by Jesus.</p>
<p>Let us then, beloved, knowing these things, give thanks to God for things of sense, but
much more for things spiritual; for such is His will, and it is on account of the latter that
He giveth the former, leading in, as it were, by these the more imperfect sort, and giving
them previous teaching, because they are yet gaping upon the world. But when such persons
having received these worldly things, rest in them, then are they upbraided and rebuked.
For in the case of him that had the palsy, Christ wished first to give that which was spiritual,
but they that were present endured it not; for when He said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee,”
they exclaimed, “This man blasphemeth.” ( Matt. ix. 2.) Let us not, I entreat you, be so affected,
but let us make more1235 account of those (spiritual) things. Wherefore? Because
when spiritual things are present with us, no harm ariseth from the absence1236 of fleshly
things; but when they are not, what hope, what comfort, shall then remain to us? wherefore
it is for these we ought always to call upon God, and entreat Him for them. And for such
hath Christ also taught us to pray; for if we unfold that Prayer, we shall find that there is
nothing carnal in it, but all spiritual, and that even the small portion which seemeth to relate
to sense, becometh by the manner spiritual. For to bid us ask no more than our “successive,”
1237 that is, our “daily,” bread, would mark a mind spiritual and truly wise. And consider
what goeth before that, “Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done as
in heaven so on earth”; then, after naming that temporal (need), He quickly leaveth it, and
bringeth1238 us again to the spiritual doctrine, saying, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive

our debtors.” Nowhere hath He put in the Prayer riches or glory or dominion, but all things
contributing to the benefit of the soul; nothing earthly, but all things heavenly. If then we
are bidden to refrain from the things of this present life, how could we help being wretched
and miserable, asking from God those things which even having He biddeth us cast away,
to free us from care about them, and for which He biddeth us take no pains.1239 This is the
“using vain repetition”; and this is why we effect nothing by our prayers. “How then,” saith
some one, “do the wicked grow rich, how the unjust and impure, plunderers and covetous?”
Not by God’s giving; (away with the thought!) but by plundering, and taking more than
their due.1240 “And how doth God allow them?” As He allowed that rich man, reserving
him for greater punishment. ( Luke xvi. 25.) Hear what (Abraham) saith to him; “Son, thou
in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.” Therefore that we also come not to hear that voice, by
living softly and idly, and gathering together for ourselves many sins, let us choose the true
riches and right wisdom, that we may obtain the promised good things; to which may we
all arrive, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>John vi. 26, 27</p>
<p>“Jesus answered them, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek Me, not because ye saw
the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor not for the meat
which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The mild and gentle is not always useful, but there are times when the teacher needs
sharper language. For if the disciple be dull and gross, then, in order to touch his dullness
to the quick, we must rouse him with1241 a goad. And this the Son of God hath done in the
present as well as in many other cases. For when the crowds had come and found Jesus, and
were flattering Him, and saying, “Master, when camest Thou hither?” to show that He desireth
not honor from men, but looketh to one thing only, their salvation, He answereth
them sharply, wishing to correct them not in this way only, but also by revealing and exposing
their thoughts. For what saith He? “Verily, verily, I say unto you,” (speaking positively and
with a confirmation,) “Ye seek Me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of
the loaves and were filled.” He chideth and reproveth them by these words, yet doth not so
abruptly or violently, but very sparingly. For He saith not, “O ye gluttons and belly-slaves,
I have wrought so many wonders, and ye never have either followed Me, or marveled at My
doings”; but mildly and gently somewhat in this manner; “Ye seek Me, not because ye saw
miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled”; speaking not only of the past,
but also of the present miracle. “It was not,” He saith, “the miracle of the loaves that astonished
you, but the being filled.”1242 And that He said not this of them by conjecture they
straightway showed, for on this account they came the second time, as being about to enjoy
the same (food) as before. Wherefore they said, “Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness.”
Again they draw Him to (the subject of) carnal food, which was the chief accusation and
charge against them. But He stoppeth not at rebukes, but addeth instruction also, saying,
“Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
life.”</p>
<p>“Which the Son of Man giveth1243 unto you; for Him hath God the Father sealed.”</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind: “Make ye no account of this earthly, but of that spiritual
food.” But since some of those who desire to live in doing nothing have abused this speech,
as though Christ would entirely abolish working, it is seasonable to say somewhat to them.
For they slander, so to speak, all Christianity, and cause it to be ridiculed on the score of
<note type="footnote">1241 al. “use towards him.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1242 al. For He all but saith this in what He directeth against them: “It was not,” U+0026c. </note>
<note type="footnote">1243 “shall give,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="316"/>
idleness. First however, we must mention that saying of Paul. What saith he? “Remember
the Lord, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.” ( Acts xx. 35.) Now how
can it be possible for him to give who hath not? How then saith Jesus to Martha, “Thou art
careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen
that good part”? ( Luke x. 41, 42 ); and again, “Take no thought for the morrow.” ( Matt. vi.
34.) For it is necessary now to resolve all these questions, not only that we may check men
if they would be idle, but also that the oracles of God may not appear to bring in what is
contradictory.</p>
<p>Now Paul in another place saith, “But we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
and more, that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business; that ye may walk honestly
toward them that are without” ( 1 Thess. iv. 10, 11, 12 ); and again; “Let him that stole, steal
no more; but rather let him labor, working with his own hands, that he may have to give to
him that needeth.” ( Eph. iv. 28.) Here the Apostle bids not simply “work,” but to work so
vigorously and laboriously, as to have thereby somewhat to give to others. And in another
place the same saith again; “These hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them
that were with me.” ( Acts xx. 34.) And writing to the Corinthians he said, “What is my reward
then? Verily, that when I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ without
charge.” ( 1 Cor. ix. 18.) And when he was in that city, he abode with Aquila and Priscilla,
“and wrought, for by their occupation they were tentmakers.” ( Acts xviii. 3.)</p>
<p>These passages show a yet more decided opposition as to the letter;1244 we must therefore
now bring forward the solution. What then must be our reply? That to “take no thought,”
doth not mean “not to work,” but “not to be nailed to the things of this life”; that is, to take
no care for to-morrow’s ease, but to deem that superfluous. For a man may do no work,
and (yet) lay up treasure for the morrow; and a man may work, yet be careful for nothing;
for carefulness and work are not the same thing; it is not as trusting to his work that a man
worketh, but, “that he may impart to him that needeth.” And that too which was said to
Martha refers not to works and working, but to this, that it is our duty to know the right
season, and not to spend on carnal things the time proper for listening. Thus Christ spake
not the words as urging her to “idleness,” but to rivet her to listening. “I came,” saith He,
“to teach you needful things, but thou art anxious about a meal. Dost thou desire to receive
Me, and to provide for Me a costly table? Provide another sort of entertainment, by giving
me a ready hearing, and by imitating thy sister’s longing for instruction.” He said not this
to forbid her hospitality, (away with the thought! how could that be?) but to show that she
ought not in the season for listening be busy about other matters. For to say, “Labor not for
the meat that perisheth,” is not the expression of one implying that we ought to be idle; (in
fact, this most especially is “meat that perisheth,” for idleness is wont to teach all wickedness;)
<note type="footnote">1244 κατὰ τὸ ῥητὸν</note>

<pb n="317"/>
but that we ought to work, and to impart. This is meat that never perisheth; but if any be
idle and gluttonous, and careth for luxury, that man worketh for “the meat that perisheth.”
So too, if a man by his labor should feed Christ, and give Him drink, and clothe Him, who1245
so senseless and mad1246 as to say that such an one labors for the meat that perisheth, when
there is for this the promise of the kingdom that is to come, and of those good things? This
meat endureth forever. But at that time, since the multitudes made no account of filth, nor
sought to learn who it was that did these things, and by what power, but desired one thing
only, to fill their bellies without working; Christ with good reason called such food, “meat
that perisheth.” “I fed,” He saith, “your bodies, that after this ye might seek that other food
which endureth, which nourisheth the soul; but ye again run1247 after that which is earthy.
Therefore ye do not understand that I lead you not to this imperfect food, but to that which
giveth not temporal but eternal life, which nourisheth not the body but the soul.” Then
when He had uttered such great words concerning Himself, and had said that He would
give this food, in order that what was spoken might not stand in their way, to make His
saying credible He attributeth the supply to the Father. For after saying, “Which the Son of
Man shall give you”; He addeth, “Him hath God the Father sealed,” that is, “hath sent Him
for this purpose, that He might bring the food to you.” The saying also admits of another
interpretation; for in another place Christ saith, “He that heareth My words, hath set to his
seal that God is true” ( c. iii. 33 ), that is, hath “showed forth undeniably.” Which indeed
the expression seems to me to hint at even in this place, for “the Father hath sealed,” is
nothing else than “hath declared,” “hath revealed by His testimony.” He in fact declared
Himself too, but since He was speaking to Jews, He brought forward the testimony of the
Father.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Learn we then, beloved, to ask of God the things which it is meet for us to ask of
Him. For those other things, those, I mean, which belong to this life, whichever way they
may fall out, can do us no injury; for if we be rich, it is here only that we shall enjoy our
luxury; and if we fall into poverty, we shall suffer nothing terrible. For neither the splendors
nor the pains of the present life have much power in respect either of despondency or
pleasure, they are contemptible, and slip away very swiftly. Wherefore they are called “a
way,” with reason, because they pass away, and by their very nature do not long endure,1248
but the things which are to come endure eternally, both those of punishment and those of
the Kingdom. Let us then in regard of these things use much diligence to avoid the first and
to choose the last. For what is the advantage of this world’s luxury? To-day it is, and to-

morrow it is not; to-day a bright flower, to-morrow scattered dust; to-day a burning fire,
to-morrow smouldering ashes. But spiritual things are not so, they ever remain shining and
blooming, and becoming brighter every day. That wealth never perishes,1249 never departs,
never ceases, never brings with it care or envy or blame, destroys not the body, corrupts not
the soul, is without ill will, heaps not up malice; all which things attend on the other kind
of wealth. That honor lifts not men into folly, doth not make them puffed up, never ceases
nor is dimmed. Again, the rest and delight of heaven endureth continually, ever being immovable
and immortal, one cannot find its end or limit. This life then let us desire, for if
we do so we shall make no account of present things, but shall despise and mock at them
all, and though one should bid us enter into kingly halls, we shall not while we have this
hope choose to do so; yet nothing (earthly) seems more near to happiness than such a permission;
but to those who are possessed by love of heaven, even this seems little and mean,
and worthy of no account. Nothing which comes to an end is to be much desired; whatever
ceases, and to-day is and tomorrow is not, even though it be very great, yet seems to be very
little and contemptible. Then let us not cling to fleeting things which slip away and depart,
but to those which are enduring and immovable. To which may we all attain,1250 through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vi. 28–30</p>
<p>“Then said they unto Him, What shall we do,1251 that we might work the works of God? Jesus
answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He
hath sent. They said therefore unto Him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see
and believe thee? what dost thou work?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> There is nothing worse, nothing more shameful, than gluttony; it makes the mind
gross, and the soul carnal; it blinds, and permits not to see clearly. Observe, for instance,
how this is the case with the Jews; for because they were intent upon gluttony, entirely occupied
with worldly things, and without any spiritual thoughts, though Christ leads them on
by ten thousand sayings, sharp and at the same time forbearing, even thus they arise not,
but continue groveling below. For consider; He said to them, “Ye seek Me, not because ye
saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the bread, and were filled”; He touched them by
the reproof, He showed them what food they ought to seek, saying, “Labor not for the meat
that perisheth”; He set before them the prize, saying, “but that which endureth unto everlasting
life”; then provided a remedy for what might have been an objection, by declaring
that He was sent from the Father.</p>
<p>What then did they? As though they had heard nothing, they said, “What shall we do,
that we might work the works of God?” This they said, not that they might learn and do
them, (as the sequel shows,) but to induce Him again to supply them with food, and desiring
to persuade Him to satisfy them. What then saith Christ? “This is the work of God, that ye
believe on Him whom He hath sent.” On this they asked, “What sign showest thou, that we
may see and believe?”</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness.”</p>
<p>Nothing more senseless, nothing more unreasonable, than these men! While the miracle
was yet in their hands,1252 as though none had been done, they spake after this manner,
“What sign shewest thou?” and having thus spoken, they do not even allow Him the right
of choosing the sign, but think to force Him to exhibit none other than such a one as was
wrought in the days of their fathers; wherefore they say, “Our fathers did eat manna in the
wilderness,” thinking by this to provoke Him to work such a miracle as might supply them
with carnal nourishment. Else why did they mention none other of the miracles of old,
though many took place in those times, both in Egypt and at the sea and in the wilderness,
but only that of the manna? Was it not because they greatly desired that one by reason of
<note type="footnote">1251 ποιῶμεν [ποιοῦμεν, G. T.].</note>
<note type="footnote">1252 al. “in their eyes.”</note>

<pb n="320"/>
the tyranny of their bellies? Ye who when ye saw His miracle called him a Prophet, and attempted
to make Him a king, how is that now, as though none had been wrought, ye have
become thankless and ill-minded, and ask for a sign, uttering words fit for parasites, or
hungry dogs? Does the manna now seem wonderful to you? Your soul is not now1253 parched
up.</p>
<p>Mark too their hypocrisy. They said not, “Moses did this sign, what doest thou?”
thinking it would annoy Him; but for a while they address Him with great reverence, through
expectation of food. So they neither said, “God did this, what doest thou?” that they might
not seem to make Him equal with God; nor did they bring forward Moses, that they might
not seem to lower Him, but put the matter in an intermediate form, “Our fathers did eat
manna in the wilderness.” He indeed might have replied, “I, but now, have wrought greater
wonders than did Moses, requiring no rod, having no need of prayer, but doing all of Myself;
and, if ye call to remembrance the manna, see, I have given you bread.” But this was not the
season for such speeches; and the one thing He earnestly desired was, to bring them to
spiritual food. And observe His infinite wisdom and His manner of answering.</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but My Father giveth you the
true bread from heaven.”</p>
<p>Why said He not, “It was not Moses that gave it to you, but I”; but putteth God in the
place of Moses, and Himself instead of manna? Because the infirmity of His hearers was
great. As is seen from what followeth. For not even when He had spoken thus did He secure
their attention, although He said at first, “Ye seek Me, not because ye saw the miracle, but
because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.” ( Ver. 26 .) Now because they sought these
(carnal) things, He would have corrected them by His succeeding words, yet not even so
did they desist. When He promised the Samaritan woman that He would give her “the water,”
He made no mention of the Father. What saith He? “If thou knewest who it is that saith
unto thee, Give Me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given
unto thee living water” ( c. iv. 10 ); and again, “The water which I shall give.” He referreth
her not to The Father. But here He maketh mention of The Father, that thou mayest understand
how great was the faith of the Samaritan woman, and how great the infirmity of the
Jews.</p>
<p>Was then the manna not from heaven? How then is it said to be from heaven? In the
same manner as Scripture speaketh of “fowls of heaven” ( Ps. viii. 8 ); and again, “The Lord
thundered from heaven.” ( Ps. xviii. 13.) And He calleth that other the “true bread,” not
because the miracle of the manna was false, but because it was a type, and not the very truth.
But in mentioning Moses, He doth not compare Himself to him, for the Jews did not as yet
prefer Him to Moses, of whom they still had a higher opinion. So that after saying, “Moses
<note type="footnote">1253 al. “when your soul is.”</note>

<pb n="321"/>
gave not,” He addeth not that “I give,” but saith that The Father, and not Moses, giveth.
They, when they heard this, replied, “Give us this bread to eat”; for they yet thought that it
was something material, they yet expected to gratify their appetites, and so hastily ran to
Him. What doth Christ? Leading them on 1254 little by little, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “The bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto
the world.”</p>
<p>Not, saith He, to Jews alone, but to all the “world,” not mere food, but “life,” another
and an altered “life.” He calleth it “life,” because they all were dead in sins. Yet they still kept
downward bent, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “Give us this bread.”</p>
<p>Then He, to rebuke them, because while they supposed that the food was material they
ran to Him, but not when they learned that it was a spiritual kind, said,</p>
<p>Ver. 35, 36. “I am the bread of life; he that cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that
believeth on Me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, that ye also have seen Me, and believe
Me not.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Thus also John crieth, saying beforehand, “He speaketh that He knoweth, and test-
ifieth that He hath seen, and no man receiveth His testimony” ( c. iii. 32 ); and again Christ
Himself, “We speak that We do know, and testify that We have seen” ( c. iii. 11 ), “and ye
believe not.”1255 This He doth to prevent them, and to show them that the matter doth not
trouble Him, that He desireth not honor, that He is not ignorant of the secrets of their minds,
nor of things present, nor of things to come.</p>
<p>“I am the bread of life.” Now He proceedeth to commit unto them mysteries. And first
He discourseth of His Godhead, saying, “I am the bread of life.” For this is not spoken of
His Body, (concerning that He saith towards the end, “And the bread which I shall give is
My flesh,”) but at present it referreth to His Godhead. For That, through God the Word, is
Bread, as this bread also, through the Spirit descending on it, is made Heavenly Bread. Here
He useth not witnesses, as in His former address, for He had the miracle of the loaves to
witness to Him, and the Jews themselves for a while pretending to believe Him; in the former
case they opposed and accused Him. This is the reason why here He declareth Himself. But
they, since they expected to enjoy a carnal feast, were not1256 disturbed until they gave up
their hope. Yet not for that was Christ silent, but uttered many words of reproof. For they,1257
who while they were eating called Him a Prophet, were here offended, and called Him the
carpenter’s son; not so while they ate the loaves, then they said, “He is The Prophet,” and
<note type="footnote">1254 al. “up.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1255 al. “and ye receive not our witness,” as in N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1256 al. “remain and are not.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1257 Ben. “But they.”</note>

<pb n="322"/>
desired to make Him a king. Now they seemed to be indignant at His asserting that He
“came down from heaven,” but in truth it was not this that caused their indignation, but
the thought that they should not enjoy a material table. Had they been really indignant, they
ought to have asked and enquired how He was the “bread of life,” how He had “come down
from heaven”; but now they do not this, but murmur. And that it was not this which offended
them is plain from another circumstance. When He said, “My Father giveth you the bread,”
they exclaimed not, “Beseech Him that He give”; but what? “Give us that bread”; yet He said
not, “I give,” but, “My Father giveth”; nevertheless, they, from desire of the food, thought
Him worthy to be trusted to for its supply. Now how should they, who deemed Him worthy
of their trust for giving, be afterward offended when they also heard that “the Father giveth”?
What is the reason? It is that when they heard that they were not to eat, they again disbelieved,
and put forth by way of a cloak for their disbelief, that “it was a high saying.” Wherefore He
saith, “Ye have seen Me, and believe not” ( c. v. 39 ); alluding partly to His miracles, partly
to the testimony from the Scriptures; “For they,” He saith, “are they which testify of Me” (
c. v. 43, 44 ); and, “I am come in My Father’s Name, and ye receive Me not”; and, “How can
ye believe which receive honor of men?”1258</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me, and him that cometh to Me I
will in nowise cast out.”</p>
<p>Observe how He doeth all things for the sake of them that are saved; therefore He added
this, that He might not seem to be trifling and speaking these things to no purpose. But
what is it that He saith, “All that the Father giveth Me shall come unto Me” ( ver. 37 ), and
“I will raise it1259 up in the last day”? ( Ver. 40.) Wherefore speaketh He of the common
resurrection, in which even the ungodly have a part, as though it were the peculiar gift of
those who believe on Him? Because He speaketh not simply of resurrection, but of a particular
kind of resurrection. For having first said, “I will not cast him out, I shall lose nothing
of it,” He then speaketh of the resurrection. Since in the resurrection some are cast out,1260
(“Take him, and cast him into outer darkness,” Matt. xxii. 13 ,) and some are destroyed.
(“Rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”) ( Matt. x. 28.) And1261
the expression, “I give eternal life” ( c. x. 28 ), declareth this; for they “that have done evil
shall go forth to the resurrection of damnation, and they that have done good to the resurrection
of life.”1262 ( c. v. 29.) This then, the resurrection to good things,1263 is that which

He here designed. But what meaneth He by saying, “All that the Father giveth Me, shall
come to Me”? He toucheth their unbelief, showing that whosoever believeth not on Him
transgresseth the will of the Father. And thus He saith it not nakedly, but in a covert manner,
and this He doth1264 everywhere, wishing to show that unbelievers are at variance with the
Father, not with Him alone. For if this is His will, and if for this He came, that He might
save man,1265 those who believe not transgress His will. “When therefore,” He saith, “the
Father guideth any man, there is nothing that hindereth him from coming unto Me”; and
in another place, “No man can come unto Me, except the Father draw him.” ( Ver. 44.) And
Paul saith, that He delivereth them up unto the Father; “When He shall have delivered up
the kingdom to God, even the Father.” ( 1 Cor. xv. 24 .) Now as the Father when He giveth
doth so without first depriving Himself, so the Son when He delivereth up doth so without
excluding Himself. He is said to deliver us up, because through Him we have access (to the
Father).</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And the “by whom”1266 is also applied to the Father, as when the Apostle saith, “By
whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son” ( 1 Cor. i. 9 ): and,1267 “By the will of
the Father.” And again; “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed
it unto thee.” ( Matt. xvi. 17.) What He here intimateth is something of this kind,1268
that “faith in Me is no ordinary thing, but needeth an impulse1269 from above”; and this He
establisheth throughout His discourse, showing that this faith requires a noble sort of soul,
and one drawn on by God.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one will say, “If all that the Father giveth, and whomsoever He shall
draw, cometh unto Thee, if none can come unto Thee except it be given him from above,
then those to whom the Father giveth not are free from any blame or charges.” These are
mere words and pretenses. For we require our own deliberate choice also, because whether
we will be taught is a matter of choice, and also whether we will believe. And in this place,
by the “which the Father giveth Me,” He declareth nothing else than that “the believing on
Me is no ordinary thing, nor one that cometh of human reasonings, but needeth a revelation
from above, and a well-ordered soul to receive that revelation.” And the, “He that cometh
to Me shall be saved,” meaneth that he shall be greatly cared for. “For on account of these,”
He saith, “I came, and took upon Me the flesh, and entered into1270 the form of a servant.”

<p>Ver. 38. “I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that
sent Me.”</p>
<p>What sayest Thou? Why, is Thy will one, and His another? That none may suspect this,
He explaineth it by what follows, saying;</p>
<p>Ver. 40. “And this is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son,
and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life.”</p>
<p>Is not then this Thy will? And how sayest Thou, “I am come to send fire upon the earth,
and what have I desired to see,1271 if that be already kindled”? ( Luke xii. 49.) For if Thou
also desirest this, it is very clear that Thy will and the Father’s is one. In another place also
He saith, “For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will.” ( c. v. 21.) But what is the will of the Father? Is it not, that not
so much as one of them should perish? This Thou willest also. ( Matt. xviii. 14.) So that the
will of the One differeth not from the will of the Other. So1272 in another place He is seen
establishing yet more firmly His equality with the Father, saying, “I and My Father ‘will
come, and will make Our abode with him.’” ( c. xiv. 23.) What He saith then is this; “I came
not to do anything other than that which the Father willeth, I have no will of Mine own
different from that of the Father, for all that is the Father’s is Mine, and all that is Mine is
the Father’s.” If now the things of the Father and the Son are in common, He saith with
reason, “Not that I might do Mine own will.” But here He speaketh not so, but reserveth
this for the end. For, as I have said, He concealeth and veileth for a while high matters, and
desireth to prove that had He even said, “This is My will,” they would have despised Him.
He therefore saith, that “I co-operate with that Will,” desiring thus to startle them more; as
though He had said, “What think ye? Do ye anger Me by your disbelief? Nay, ye provoke
My Father.” “For this is the will of Him that sent Me, that of all which He hath given Me I
should lose nothing.” ( Ver. 39.) Here He showeth that He needeth not their service, that
He came not for His own advantage,1273 but for their salvation; and not to get honor from
them. Which indeed He declared in a former address, saying, “I receive not honor from
men” ( c. v. 41 ); and again, “These things I say that ye may be saved.” ( c. v. 34.) Since He
everywhere laboreth to persuade1274 them that He came for their salvation. And He saith,
that He obtaineth honor to the Father, in order that He may not be suspected by them. And
that it is for this reason He thus speaketh, He hath more clearly revealed by what follows.

For He saith, “He that seeketh his own will1275 seeketh his own glory; but He that seeketh
His glory that sent Him is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.” ( c. vii. 18.) “And
this is the will of the Father, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may
have everlasting life.” ( Ver. 40.)</p>
<p>“And I will raise him up at the last day.” Why doth He continually dwell upon the Resurrection?
Is it that men may not judge of God’s providence by present things alone; that
if they enjoy not results1276 here, they become not on that account desponding, but wait
for the things that are to come, and that they may not, because their sins are not punished
for the present, despise Him, but look for another life.</p>
<p>Now those men gained nothing, but let us take pains to gain by having the Resurrection
continually sounded in our ears; and if we desire to be grasping, or to steal, or to do any
wrong thing, let us straightway take into our thoughts that Day, let us picture to ourselves
the Judgment-seat, for such reflections will check the evil impulse more strongly than any
bit. Let us continually say to others,1277 and to ourselves, “There is a resurrection, and a
fearful tribunal awaiteth us.” If we see any man insolent and puffed up with the good things
of his world, let us make the same remark to him, and show him that all those things abide
here: and if we observe another grieving and impatient, let us say the same to him, and point
out to him that his sorrows shall have an end; if we see one careless and dissipated,1278 let
us say the same charm over him, and show that for his carelessness he must render account.
This saying is able more than any other remedy to heal our souls. For there is a Resurrection,
and that Resurrection is at our doors, not afar off, nor at a distance. “For yet a little while,
and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.” ( Heb. x. 37.) And again, “We must
all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ” ( 2 Cor. v. 10 ); that is, both bad and good,
the one to be shamed in sight of all, the other in sight of all to be made more glorious. For
as they who judge here punish the wicked and honor the good publicly, so too will it be
there, that the one sort may have the greater shame, and the other more conspicuous glory.
Let us picture these things to ourselves every day. If we are ever revolving them, no care for
present things will be able to sting us. 1279 “For the things which are seen are temporal, but
the things which are not seen are eternal.” ( 2 Cor. iv. 18.) Continually let us say to ourselves
and to others,1280 “There is a Resurrection, and a Judgment, and a scrutiny of our actions”;
and let as many as deem that there is such a thing as fate repeat this, and they shall

straightway be delivered from the rottenness of their malady; for if there is a Resurrection,
and a Judgment, there is no fate, though they bring ten thousand arguments, and choke
themselves to prove it. But I am ashamed to be teaching Christians concerning the Resurrection:
for he that needeth to learn that there is a Resurrection, and who hath not firmly
persuaded himself that the affairs of this world go not on by fate, and without design, and
as chance will have them, can be no Christian. Wherefore, I exhort and beseech you, that
we cleanse ourselves from all wickedness, and do all in our power to obtain pardon and excuse
in that Day.</p>
<p>Perhaps some one will say, “When will be the consummation? When will be the Resurrection?
See how long a time hath gone by, and nothing of the kind hath come to pass?” Yet
it shall be, be sure. For those before the flood spake after this manner, and mocked at Noah,
but the flood came and swept away1281 all those unbelievers, but preserved him1282 who
believed. And the men of Lot’s time expected not that stroke from God, until those lightnings
and thunderbolts came down and destroyed them all utterly. Neither in the case of these
men, nor of those who lived in the time of Noah, was there any preamble1283 to what was
about to happen, but when they were all living daintily, and drinking, and mad with wine,
then came these intolerable calamities upon them. So also shall the Resurrection be; not
with any preamble, but while we are in the midst of good times.1284 Wherefore Paul saith,
“For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as
travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” ( 1 Thess. v. 3.) God hath so
ordered this, that we may be always struggling, and be not confident even in time of safety.
What sayest thou? Dost thou not expect that there will be a Resurrection and a Judgment?
The devils confess these, and art thou shameless?1285 “Art Thou come,” they say, “to torment
us before the time?” ( Matt. viii. 29 ); now they who say that there will be “torment;” are
aware of the Judgment, and the reckoning, and the vengeance. Let us not then besides daring
evil deeds, anger God by disbelieving the word of the Resurrection. For as in other things
Christ hath been our beginning, so also hath He in this; wherefore He is called “the firstborn
from the dead.” ( Col. i. 18.) Now if there were no Resurrection, how could He be “the
first-born,” when no one of “the dead” was to follow Him? If there were no Resurrection,
how would the justice of God be preserved, when so many evil men prosper, and so many
good men are afflicted and die in their affliction? Where shall each of these obtain his deserts,
if so be that there is no Resurrection? No one of those who have lived aright disbelieves the
<note type="footnote">1281 al. “seized.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1282 al. “him only.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1283 προοίμιον</note>
<note type="footnote">1284 lit. “fair weather.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1285 al. “dost thou not confess?”</note>

<pb n="327"/>
Resurrection, but every day they pray and repeat that holy sentence, “Thy Kingdom come.”
Who then are they that disbelieve the Resurrection? They who have unholy ways and an
unclean life: as the Prophet saith, “His ways are always polluted. Thy judgments are far
above out of his sight.” ( Ps. x. 5.) For a man cannot possibly live a pure life without believing
in the Resurrection; since they who are conscious of no iniquity both speak of, and wish
for, and believe in it, that they may receive their recompense. Let us not then anger Him,
but hear Him when He saith, “Fear Him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell”
( Matt. x. 28 ); that by that fear we may become better, and being delivered from that perdition,
may be deemed worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Which may we all attain to, through
the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and to the endless ages of eternity. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLVI.</head>
<p>John vi. 41, 42</p>
<p>“The Jews then murmured at Him, because He said, I am the Bread which came down from
heaven; and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we
know? How is it then that He saith, I came down from heaven?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “Whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame” ( Philip. iii. 19 ), said
Paul of certain persons, writing to the Philippians.1286 Now that the Jews were of this
character is clear, both from what has gone before, and from what they came and said to
Christ. For when He gave them bread, and filled their bellies, they said that He was a
Prophet, and sought to make Him a King: but when He taught them concerning spiritual
food, concerning eternal life, when He led them away from objects of sense, and spake to
them of a resurrection, and raised their thoughts to higher matters, when most they ought
to have admired, they murmur and start away. And yet, if He was that Prophet as they before
asserted, declaring that he it was of whom Moses had said, “A Prophet shall the Lord your
God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye hearken” ( Deut.
xviii. 15 ); they ought to have hearkened to Him when He said, “I came down from heaven”;
yet they hearkened not, but murmured. They still reverenced Him, because the miracle of
the loaves was recent, and therefore they did not openly gainsay Him, but by murmuring
expressed their displeasure, that He did not give them the meal which they desired. And
murmuring they said, “Is not this the son of Joseph?” Whence it is plain, that as yet they
knew not of His strange and marvelous Generation. And so they still say that He is the son
of Joseph, and are not rebuked; and He saith not to them, “I am not the Son of Joseph”; not
because He was his son, but because they were not as yet able to hear of that marvelous
Birth. And if they could not bear to hear in plain terms of His birth according to the flesh,
much less could they hear of that ineffable Birth which is from above. If He revealed not
that which was lower to them, much less would He commit to them the other. Although
this greatly offended them, that He was born from a mean and common father, still He revealed
not to them the truth, lest in removing one cause of offense He should create another.
What then said He when they murmured?</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “No man can come unto Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw Him.”</p>
<p>The Manichæans spring upon these words, saying, “that nothing lies in our own power”;
yet the expression showeth that we are masters of our will. “For if a man cometh to Him,”
saith some one, “what need is there of drawing?” But the words do not take away our free
will, but show that we greatly need assistance. And He implieth not an unwilling1287 comer,
<note type="footnote">1286 al. “speaking concerning the Jews.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1287 Sav. ἄ κοντα, Ben. τυχόντα</note>

<pb n="329"/>
but one enjoying much succor. Then He showeth also the manner in which He draweth;
for that men may not, again, form any material idea of God, He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 46. “Not that any man hath seen God,1288 save He which is of God, He hath seen
the Father.”</p>
<p>“How then,” saith some one, “doth the Father draw?” This the Prophet explained of
old, when he proclaimed beforehand, and said,</p>
<p>Ver. 45. “They shall all be taught of God.” ( Isa. liv. 13.)</p>
<p>Seest thou the dignity of faith, and that not of men nor by man, but by God Himself
they shall1289 learn this? And to make this assertion credible, He referred them to their
prophets. “If then ‘all shall be taught of God,’ how is it that some shall not believe?” Because
the words are spoken of the greater number. Besides, the prophecy meaneth not absolutely
all, but all that have the will. For the teacher sitteth ready to impart what he hath to all, and
pouring forth his instruction unto all.</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “And I will raise him up in the last day.”</p>
<p>Not slight here is the authority of the Son, if so be that the Father leadeth, He raiseth
up. He distinguisheth not His working from that of the Father, (how could that be?) but
showeth equality1290 of power. As, therefore, after saying in that other place, “The Father
which hath sent Me beareth witness of Me,” He then, that they might not be over-curious
about the utterance, referred them to the Scriptures; so here, that they may not entertain
similar suspicions, He referreth them to the Prophets, whom He continually and everywhere
quoteth, to show that He is not opposed to the Father.</p>
<p>“But what of those,” saith some one, “who were before His time? Were not they taught
of God? why then the special application of the words here?” Because of old they learned
the things of God by the hands of men, but now by the Only-begotten Son of God, and by
the Holy Ghost. Then He addeth, “Not that any man hath seen the Father, save He which
is of God,”1291 using this expression here not with reference to the cause, but to the manner
of being.1292 Since had He spoken in the former sense, we are all “of God.” And where then
would be the special and distinct nature of the Son? “But wherefore,” saith some one, “did
He not put this more clearly?” Because of their weakness. For if when He said, “I am come
down from heaven,” they were so offended, what would they have felt had He added this?</p>

<p>He calleth Himself, ( ver. 48 ,) “the bread of life,” because He maintaineth1293 our life
both which is and which is to be, and saith, “Whosoever1294 shall eat of this bread shall live
for ever.” By “bread” He meaneth here either His saving doctrines and the faith which is in
Him, or His own Body; for both nerve the soul. Yet in another place He said, “If a man
hear1295 My saying, he shall never taste of death.” ( c. viii. 51.) And they were offended; here
they had no such feeling perhaps, because they yet respected Him on account of the loaves
which had been made.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And observe how He distinguisheth between His bread and the manna, by causing
them to hear the result of each kind of food. For to show that the manna afforded them no
unusual advantage, He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 49. “Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.”</p>
<p>He then establisheth a thing most likely to persuade them, that they were deemed worthy
of greater things than their fathers, (meaning those marvelous men who lived in the time
of Moses,) and so, after saying that they were dead who ate the manna, He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 51. “He that eateth1296 of this bread, shall live for ever.”</p>
<p>Nor hath He put “in the wilderness” without a cause, but to point out that the supply
of manna was not extended to a long time, nor entered with them into the land of promise.
But this “bread” was not of the same kind.</p>
<p>“And the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”</p>
<p>Here one might reasonably enquire, how this was a fit season for these words, which
neither edified nor profited, but rather did mischief to those who had been edified; for “from
that time,” saith the Evangelist, “many of His disciples went back,” saying, “This is a hard
saying; who can hear it?” ( ver. 60 ); since these things might have been entrusted to the
disciples only, as Matthew hath told us that He discoursed with them apart. ( Mark iv. 34:
see Matt. xiii. 36.) What then shall we say? What is the profit of the words? Great is the
profit and necessity of them. Because they pressed upon Him, asking for bodily food, reminding
Him of the food provided in the days of their forefathers, and speaking of the
manna as a great thing, to show them that all those things were but type and shadow, but
that the very reality of the matter was now present with them, He mentioneth spiritual food.
“But,” saith some one, “he ought to have said, Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness,
but I have given you bread.” But the interval between the two miracles was great, and the
latter of them would have appeared inferior to the former, because the manna came down
from heaven, but this, the miracle of the loaves, was wrought on earth. When therefore they
<note type="footnote">1293 συγκρατεῖ, al. συγκροτεῖ</note>

<note type="footnote">1296 “If any man eat,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="331"/>
sought food “coming down from heaven,” He continually told them, “I came down from
heaven.” And if any one enquire why He introduced the discourse on the Mysteries, we will
reply, that this was a very fitting time for such discourses; for indistinctness in what is said
always rouses the hearer, and renders him more attentive. They ought not then to have been
offended, but rather to have asked and enquired. But now they went back. If they believed
Him to be a Prophet, they ought to have believed His words, so that the offense was caused
by their own folly, not by any difficulty in the words. And observe how by little and little
He led them up to Himself. Here He saith that Himself giveth, not the Father;1297 “The
bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”</p>
<p>“But,” saith some one, “this doctrine was strange to them and unusual.”1298 And yet
John at an earlier period alluded to it by calling Him “Lamb.” ( c. i. 29.) “But for all that,
they knew it not.” I know they did not; nay, neither did the disciples understand. For if as
yet they had no clear knowledge of the Resurrection, and so knew not what, “Destroy this
Temple, and in three days I will raise it up” ( John ii. 19 ), might mean, much more would
they be ignorant of what is said here. For these words were less clear than those. Since that
prophets had raised men1299 from the dead, they knew, even if the Scriptures have not
spoken so clearly on the subject, but not one of them ever asserted that any man had eaten
flesh. Still they obeyed, and followed Him, and confessed that He had the words of eternal
life. For this is a disciple’s part, not to be over-curious about the assertions of his teacher,
but to hear and obey him, and to wait the proper time for the solution of any difficulties.
“How then,” saith some one, “was it that the contrary came to pass, and that these men
‘went back’?” It was by reason of their folly. For when questioning concerning the “how”
comes in, there comes in with it unbelief. So Nicodemus was perplexed, saying, “How can
a man enter into his mother’s womb?” So also these are confounded, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 52. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p>If thou seekest to know the “how,” why askedst not thou this in the matter of the loaves,
how He extended five to so great a number? Because they then only thought of being satisfied,
not of seeing the miracle. “But,” saith some one, “their experience then taught them.” Then
by reason of that experience these words ought to have been readily received. For to this
end He wrought beforehand that strange miracle, that taught by it they might no longer
disbelieve what should be said by Him afterwards.</p>
<note type="footnote">1297 al. “And observe how He bound the disciples to Himself; for these are they who say, ‘ Thou hast the

<p><del>3.</del> Those men then at that time reaped no fruit from what was said, but we have enjoyed
the benefit in the very realities. Wherefore it is necessary to understand the marvel of the
Mysteries, what it is, why it was given, and what is the profit of the action. We become one
Body, and “members of His flesh and of His bones.” ( Eph. v. 30.) Let the initiated1300 follow
what I say. In order then that we may become this not by love only, but in very deed, let us
be blended1301 into that flesh. This is effected by the food which He hath freely given us,
desiring to show the love which He hath for us. On this account He hath mixed up Himself
with us; He hath kneaded up1302 His body with ours, that we might be a certain One
Thing,1303 like a body joined to a head. For this belongs to1304 them who love strongly; this,
for instance, Job implied, speaking of his servants, by whom he was beloved so exceedingly,
that they desired to cleave unto his flesh. For they said, to show the strong love which they
felt, “Who would give us to be satisfied with his flesh?” ( Job xxxi. 31.) Wherefore this also
Christ hath done, to lead us to a closer friendship, and to show His love for us; He hath
given to those who desire Him not only to see Him, but even to touch, and eat Him, and fix
their teeth in His flesh, and to embrace Him, and satisfy all their love. Let us then return
from that table like lions breathing fire, having become terrible to the devil; thinking on our
Head, and on the love which He hath shown for us. Parents often entrust their offspring to
others to feed; “but I,” saith He, “do not so, I feed you with Mine own flesh, desiring that
you all be nobly born,1305 and holding forth to you good hopes for the future. For He who
giveth out Himself to you here, much more will do so hereafter. I have willed to become
your Brother, for your sake I shared in flesh and blood, and in turn I give out to you the
flesh and the blood by which I became your kinsman.” This blood causeth the image of our
King to be fresh1306 within us, produceth beauty unspeakable, permitteth not the nobleness
of our souls to waste away, watering it continually, and nourishing it. The blood derived
from our food becomes not at once blood, but something else; while this doth not so, but
straightway watereth our souls, and worketh in them some mighty power. This1307 blood,
if rightly taken, driveth away devils, and keepeth them afar off from us, while it calleth to
us Angels and the Lord of Angels. For wherever they see the Lord’s blood, devils flee, and
Angels run together. This blood poured forth washed clean all the world; many wise sayings

did the blessed Paul utter concerning it in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This blood cleansed
the secret place, and the Holy of Holies. And if the type of it had such great power in the
temple of the Hebrews, and in the midst of Egypt, when smeared on the door-posts, much
more the reality. This blood sanctified the golden altar; without it the high priest dared not
enter into the secret place. This blood consecrated1308 priests, this in types cleansed1309
sins. But if it had such power in the types, if death so shuddered at the shadow, tell me how
would it not have dreaded the very reality? This blood is the salvation of our souls, by this
the soul is washed,1310 by this is beautiful, by this is inflamed, this causeth our understanding
to be more bright than fire, and our soul more beaming than gold; this blood was poured
forth, and made heaven accessible.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Awful in truth are the Mysteries of the Church, awful in truth is the Altar. A fountain
went up out of Paradise sending forth1311 material rivers, from this table springeth up a
fountain which sendeth forth rivers spiritual. By the side of this fountain are planted not
fruitless willows, but trees reaching even to heaven, bearing fruit ever timely and undecaying.
If any be scorched with heat, let him come to the side of this fountain and cool his burning.
For it quencheth drought, and comforteth1312 all things that are burnt up, not by the sun,
but by the fiery darts. For it hath its beginning from above, and its source is there, whence
also its water floweth. Many are the streams of that fountain which the Comforter sendeth
forth, and the Son is the Mediator, not holding mattock to clear the way, but opening our
minds. This fountain is a fountain of light, spouting forth rays of truth. By it stand the
Powers on high looking upon the beauty of its streams, because they more clearly perceive
the power of the Things set forth, and the flashings unapproachable. For as when gold is
being molten if one should (were it possible) dip in it his hand or his tongue, he would immediately
render them golden; thus, but in much greater degree, doth what here is set forth
work upon the soul. Fiercer than fire the river boileth up, yet burneth not, but only baptizeth
that on which it layeth hold. This blood was ever typified of old in the altars and sacrifices
1313 of righteous men, This is the price of the world, by This Christ purchased to Himself
the Church, by This He hath adorned Her all. For as a man buying servants giveth gold for
them, and again when he desireth to deck them out doth this also with gold; so Christ hath
purchased us with His blood, and adorned us with His blood. They who share this blood
stand with Angels and Archangels and the Powers that are above, clothed in Christ’s own

kingly robe, and having the armor of the Spirit. Nay, I have not as yet said any great thing:
they are clothed with the King Himself.</p>
<p>Now as this is a great and wonderful thing, so if thou approach it with pureness, thou
approachest for salvation; but if with an evil conscience, for punishment and vengeance.
“For,” It saith, “he that eateth and drinketh unworthily” of the Lord, “eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself” ( 1 Cor. xi. 29 ); since if they who defile the kingly purple are punished
equally with those who rend it, it is not 1314 unreasonable that they who receive the Body
with unclean thoughts should suffer the same punishment as those who rent it with the
nails. Observe at least how fearful a punishment Paul declareth, when he saith, “He that
despised Moses’ law dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer
punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son
of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing?” ( Heb. i. 28.) Take we then heed to ourselves, beloved, we who enjoy such blessings;
and if we desire to utter any shameful word, or perceive ourselves hurried away by wrath
or any like passion, let us consider of what things we have been deemed worthy, of how
great a Spirit we have partaken, and this consideration shall be a sobering of our unreasonable
passions. For how long shall we be nailed to present things? How long shall it be before we
rouse ourselves? How long shall we neglect our own salvation? Let us bear in mind of what
things Christ has deemed us worthy, let us give thanks, let us glorify Him, not by our faith
alone, but also by our very works, that we may obtain the good things that are to come,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom,
to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLVII.</head>
<p>John vi. 53, 54</p>
<p>“Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have not eternal1315 life in yourselves. Whoso eateth
My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath life1316 in himself.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> When we converse of spiritual things, let there be nothing secular in our souls,
nothing earthy, let all such thoughts retire, and be banished, and let us1317 be entirely given
up to the hearing the divine oracles only. For if at the arrival of a king1318 all confusion is
driven away, much more when the Spirit speaketh with us do we need1319 great stillness,
great awe. And worthy of awe is that which is said to-day. How it is so, hear. “Verily I say
unto you, Except a man eat My flesh, and drink My blood, he hath not eternal life in him.”
Since the Jews had before asserted that this was impossible, He showeth not only that it is
not impossible, but that it is absolutely necessary. Wherefore He addeth, “He that eateth
My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life.”</p>
<p>“And I will raise him up at the last day.” For since He had said, “He that eateth of this
bread shall not die for ever” ( ver. 50 , not verbally quoted), and it was likely that this would
stand in their way, (just as they before said, “Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead;
and how sayest Thou, that he shall not taste of death?”— c. viii. 52 , not verbally quoted.)
He bringeth forward the Resurrection to solve the question, and to show that (the man who
eateth) shall not die at the last.1320 He continually handleth the subject of the Mysteries,
showing the necessity of the action, and that it must by all means be done.</p>
<p>Ver. 55. “For My flesh is true1321 meat, and My blood is true drink.”</p>
<p>What is that He saith?1322 He either desireth to declare that this is the true meat which
saveth the soul, or to assure them concerning what had been said, that they might not suppose
the words to be a mere enigma or parable, but might know that it is by all means needful to
eat the Body. Then He saith,</p>
<note type="footnote">1315 “no life,” N.T.</note>

<p>Ver. 56. “He that eateth My flesh, dwelleth in Me.”</p>
<p>This He said, showing that such an one is blended with1323 Him. Now what follows
seems unconnected, unless we enquire into the sense; for, saith some one, after saying, “He
that eateth My flesh, dwelleth in Me,” what kind of a consequence is it to add,</p>
<p>Ver. 57. “As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father”?</p>
<p>Yet the words harmonize perfectly. For since He continually spake of “eternal life,” to
prove this point He introduceth the expression, “dwelleth in Me”; for “if he dwelleth in Me,
and I live, it is plain that he will live also.” Then He saith, “As the living Father hath sent
Me.” This is an expression of comparison and resemblance, and its meaning is of this kind,
“I live in like manner as the Father liveth.” And that thou mayest not deem Him unbegotten,
He immediately subjoineth, “by the Father,” not by this to show that He needeth, in order
to live, any power working in Him,1324 for He said before, to remove such a suspicion, “As
the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son also to have life in Himself”;
now if He needeth the working of another, it will be found that either the Father hath not
given Him so to have it, and so the assertion is false, or if He hath so given it, then He will
need no other one to support Him. What then means the, “By the Father”? He here merely
hinteth at the cause, and what He saith is of this kind: “As the Father liveth, so I live, and
he that eateth Me shall live by Me.” And the “life” of which He speaketh is not life merely,
but the excellent1325 life; for that He spake not simply of life, but of that glorious and ineffable
life, is clear from this. For all men “live,” even unbelievers, and uninitiated, who eat not of
that flesh. Seest thou that the words relate not to this life, but to that other? And what He
saith is of this kind: “He that eateth My flesh, when he dieth shall not perish nor suffer
punishment”; He spake not of the general resurrection, (for all alike rise again,) but concerning
the special, the glorious Resurrection, that which hath a reward.</p>
<p>Ver. 58. “This is that bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers did eat
manna, and are dead; he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.”</p>
<p>Continually doth He handle the same point, so as to imprint it on the understanding
of the hearers, (for the teaching on these points was a kind of final teaching,) and to confirm
the doctrine of the Resurrection and of eternal life. Wherefore He mentioneth the Resurrection
since He promiseth eternal life, showing that that life is not now, but after the Resurrection.
1326 “And whence,” saith some one, “are these things clear?” From the Scriptures; to
them He everywhere referreth the Jews, bidding them learn these things from them. And
by saying, “Which giveth life to the world,” He inciteth them to jealousy, that from very

<note type="footnote">1324 ἐ νεργείας</note>
<note type="footnote">1325 εὐδόκιμον</note>
<note type="footnote">1326 Ben. “both because He had said eternal life, and also showing.”</note>

<pb n="337"/>
vexation that others should enjoy the gift, they may not stay without. And continually He
remindeth them of the manna, showing the difference, (between it and His bread,) and
guiding them to the faith; for if He was able1327 to support their life for forty years without
harvest, or corn, or other things in course;1328 much more now will He be able to do so, as
having come for greater ends. Moreover, if those things were but types, and yet men collected
what came down without sweat or labor; much more shall this be the case, where the difference
is great both in the never dying, and in the enjoying the true life. And rightly hath He
spoken often of “life,” since this is desired by men, and nothing is so pleasing to them as
not to die. Since even under the old Covenant, this was the promise, length of life and many
days, but now it is not length merely, but life having no end. He desireth at the same time
to show, that He now revoketh the punishment caused by sin, annulling that sentence which
condemneth to death, and bringing in not life merely, but life eternal, contrariwise to the
former things.1329</p>
<p>Ver. 59. “These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> The place where most of His marvels had been done, so that He ought there especially
to have been listened to. But wherefore taught He in the synagogue and in the Temple? As
well because He desired to catch the greatest number of them, as because He desired to show
that He was not opposed to the Father.</p>
<p>Ver. 60. “But many of the disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying.”</p>
<p>What means “hard”? Rough, laborious, troublesome. Yet He said nothing of this kind,
for He spake not of a mode of life,1330 but of doctrines, continually handling the faith which
is in Him. What then means, “is a hard saying”? Is it because it promiseth life and resurrection?
Is it because He said that He came down from heaven? Or that it was impossible for
one to be saved who ate not His flesh? Tell me, are these things “hard”? Who can assert that
they are? What then means “hard”? It means, “difficult to be received,” “transcending their
infirmity,” “having much terror.” For they thought that He uttered words too high for His
real character, and such as were above Himself. Therefore they said,</p>
<p>“Who can hear it?”</p>
<p>Perhaps making excuse for themselves, since they were about to start away.</p>
<p>Ver. 61, 62. “When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it,” (for this
is an attribute of His Godhead to bring secret things to light,) “He said unto them, Doth
this offend you? What and if ye shall see1331 the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?”</p>

<pb n="338"/>
<p>This also He doth in the case of Nathanael, saying, “Because I said unto thee, I saw thee
under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.” ( c. i. 50.) And
to Nicodemus, “No man hath ascended up to heaven but the Son of man which is in heaven.”
( c. iii. 13.) What then, doth He add difficulties to difficulties? No, (that be far from Him,)
but by the greatness of the doctrines, and the number of them, He desireth to bring them
over. For if one had said simply, “I have come down from heaven,” and added nothing more,
he would have been the more likely to offend them; but He who said, “My body is the life
of the world”; He who said, “As the living Father hath sent Me, so I live by the Father”; and
who said, “I have come down from heaven,” solves the difficulty. For the man who utters
any one great thing concerning himself may perhaps be suspected of feigning, but he who
connects together so many one after another removes all suspicion. All that He doth and
saith is intended to lead them away from the thought, that Joseph was His father. And it
was not with a wish to strengthen, but rather to do away that stumbling-block, that He said
this. For whosoever deemed that He was Joseph’s son could not receive His sayings, while
one that was persuaded that He had come down from heaven, and would ascend thither,
might more easily give heed to His words: at the same time He bringeth forward also another
explanation, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 63. “It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.”</p>
<p>His meaning is, “Ye must hear spiritually what relateth to Me, for he who heareth carnally
is not profited, nor gathereth any advantage.” It was carnal to question how He came down
from heaven, to deem that He was the son of Joseph, to ask, “How can he give us His flesh
to eat?” All this was carnal, when they ought to have understood the matter in a mystical
and spiritual sense. “But,” saith some one, “how could they understand what the ‘eating
flesh’ might mean?” Then it was their duty to wait for the proper time and enquire, and not
to abandon Him.</p>
<p>“The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.”</p>
<p>That is, they are divine and spiritual, have nothing carnal about them, are not subject
to the laws of physical consequence, but are free from any such necessity, are even set above
the laws appointed for this world, and have also another and a different meaning. Now as
in this passage He said “spirit,” instead of “spiritual,” so when He speaketh of “flesh,” He
meant not “carnal things,” but “carnally hearing,” and alluding at the same time to them,
because they ever desired carnal things when they ought to have desired spiritual. For if a
man receives them carnally, he profits nothing. “What then, is not His flesh, flesh?” Most
certainly. “How then saith He, that the flesh profiteth nothing?” He speaketh not of His own
flesh, (God forbid!) but of those who received His words in a carnal manner. But what is
“understanding carnally”? It is looking merely to what is before our eyes, without imagining
anything beyond. This is understanding carnally. But we must not judge thus by sight, but
must look into all mysteries with the eyes within. This is seeing spiritually. He that eateth

<pb n="339"/>
not His flesh, and drinketh not His blood, hath no life in him. How then doth “the flesh
profit nothing,” if without it we cannot live? Seest thou that the words, “the flesh profiteth
nothing,” are spoken not of His own flesh, but of carnal hearing?</p>
<p>Ver. 64. “But there are some of you that believe not.”</p>
<p>Again, according to His custom, He addeth weight to His words, by foretelling what
would come to pass, and by showing that He spake thus not from desire of honor from
them, but because He cared for them. And when He said “some,” He excepted the disciples.
For at first He said, “Ye have both seen Me, and believe not” ( ver. 36 ); but here, “There are
some of you that believe not.”</p>
<p>For He “knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should
betray Him.”</p>
<p>Ver. 65. “And He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto Me except
it were given unto Him from above from My Father.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Here the Evangelist intimates to us the voluntary character of the Dispensation,
and His endurance of evil. Nor is the, “from the beginning,” put here without a cause, but
that thou mayest be aware of His foreknowledge from the first, and that before the words
were uttered, and not after the men had murmured nor after they had been offended, He
knew the traitor, but before, which was an attribute of Godhead. Then He added, “Except
it be given him from above from My Father”; thus persuading them to deem God His
Father, not Joseph, and showing them that it is no common thing to believe in Him. As
though He had said, “Unbelievers disturb Me not; trouble Me not, astonish Me not. I know
of old before they were created, I know to whom the Father hath given to believe;” and do
thou, when thou hearest that “He hath given,” imagine not merely an arbitrary distribution,
1332 but that if any hath rendered himself worthy to receive the gift, he hath received
it.</p>
<p>Ver. 66. “From that time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with
Him.”</p>
<p>Rightly hath the Evangelist said, not that they “departed,” but that they “went back”;
showing that they cut themselves off from any increase in virtue, and that by separating
themselves they lost the faith which they had of old. But this was not the case with the twelve;
wherefore He saith to them,</p>
<p>Ver. 67. “Will ye also go away?”</p>
<p>Again showing that He needeth not their ministry and service, and proving to them
that it was not for this that He led them about with Him. For how could He when He used
such expressions even to them? But why did He not praise them? why did He not approve
them? Both because He preserved the dignity befitting a teacher, and also to show them that
<note type="footnote">1332 ἀ ποκλήρωσιν</note>

<pb n="340"/>
they ought rather to be attracted by this mode of dealing. For had He praised them, they
might, supposing that they were doing Him a favor, have had some human feeling; but by
showing them that He needed not their attendance, He kept them to Him the more. And
observe with what prudence He spake. He said not, “Depart ye,” (this would have been to
thrust them from Him,) but asked them a question, “Will ye also go away?” the expression
of one who would remove all force or compulsion, and who wished not that they should be
attached to Him through any sense of shame, but with a sense of favor. By not openly accusing,
but gently glancing at them, He showeth what is the truly wise course under such circumstances.
But we feel differently; with good reason, since we do everything holding fast
our own honor, and therefore think that our estate is lowered by the departure of those who
attend on us. But He neither flattered nor repulsed them, but asked them a question. Now
this was not the act of one despising them, but of one wishing them not to be restrained by
force and compulsion: for to remain on such terms is the same as to depart. What then saith
Peter?</p>
<p>Ver. 68, 69. “To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe
and are sure that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that it was not the words that caused offense, but the heedlessness, and sloth,
and wrong-mindedness of the hearers? For even had He not spoken, they would have been
offended, and would not have ceased to be ever anxious about bodily food, ever nailed to
earth. Besides, the disciples heard at the same time with the others, yet they declared an
opinion contrary to theirs, saying, “To whom shall we go?” An expression indicating much
affection, for it shows that their Teacher1333 was more precious to them than anything, than
father or mother, or any possessions,1334 and that if they withdrew from Him, they had not
then whither to flee. Then lest it should seem that he had said, “to whom shall we go?” because
there were none that would receive them, he straightway added, “Thou hast the words of
eternal life.” For the Jews listened carnally, and with human reasonings, but the disciples
spiritually, and committing all to faith. Wherefore Christ said, “The words which I have
spoken unto you are spirit”; that is, “do not suppose that the teaching of My words is subject
to the rule of material consequences, or to the necessity of created things. Things spiritual
are not of this nature, nor endure to submit to the laws of earth.” This also Paul declareth,
saying, “Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down;)
or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.”) (
Rom. x. 6, 7.)</p>
<p>“Thou hast the words of eternal life.” These men already admitted the Resurrection,
and all the apportionment1335 which shall be there. And observe the brotherly and affection-
<note type="footnote">1333 al. “Christ.”</note>

<note type="footnote">1335 or, “rest,” ληξιν</note>

<pb n="341"/>
ate man, how he maketh answer for all the band. For he said not, “I know,” but, “We know.”
Or rather, observe how he goes to the very words of his Teacher, not speaking as did the
Jews. They said, “This is the son of Joseph”; but he said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God”; and “Thou hast the words of eternal life”; having perhaps heard Him say,1336
“He that believeth on Me1337 hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.” For
he showed that he retained all that had been said, by recalling the very words. What then
did Christ? He neither praised nor expressed admiration of Peter, though He had elsewhere
done so; but what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 70. “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?”</p>
<p>For since Peter said, “We believe,” Jesus excepteth Judas from the band. In the other
place Peter made no mention of the disciples; but when Christ said, “Whom say ye that I
am?” he replied, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God” ( Matt. xvi. 15 ); but here,
since he said, “We believe,” Christ with reason admitteth not Judas into that band. And this
He did afar off, and long before the time, to check the wickedness of the traitor, knowing
that He should avail nothing, yet doing His own part.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> And remark His wisdom. He made not the traitor manifest, yet allowed him not to
be hidden; that on the one hand he might not lose all shame, and become more contentious;
and on the other, that he might not, thinking to be unperceived, work his wicked deed
without fear. Therefore by degrees He bringeth plainer reproofs against him. First, He
numbered him too among the others, when He said, “There are some of you that believe
not,” (for that He counted the traitor the Evangelist hath declared, saying, “For He knew
from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray Him;”) but
when he yet remained such, He brought against him a more severe rebuke, “One of you is
a devil,” yet made the fear common to them all, wishing to conceal him. And here it is worth
while to enquire, why the disciples at this time said nothing, but afterwards were afraid and
doubted, looking one upon another, and asking, “Lord, is it I?” ( Matt. xxvi. 22 ), when
Peter beckoned to John to find out the traitor, by enquiring of their Teacher which was he.
What is1338 the reason? Peter had not yet heard, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” wherefore
he had no fear at all; but when he had been rebuked, and though he spoke through strong
affection,1339 instead of being approved of, had even been called “Satan,” he afterwards with
reason feared when he heard, “One of you shall betray Me.” Besides, He saith not even now,
“One of you shall betray Me,” but, “One of you is a devil”; wherefore they understood not
what was spoken, but thought that He was only reflecting upon their wickedness.</p>

<note type="footnote">1338 al. “Is not this.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1339 διαθεσεως</note>

<pb n="342"/>
<p>But wherefore said He, “I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil”? It was to
show that His teaching was entirely free from flattery. For that they might not think that
He would flatter them, because when all had left Him they alone remained, and confessed
by Peter that He was the Christ, He leadeth them away from such a suspicion. And what
He saith is of this kind. “Nothing abasheth Me from rebuking the bad; think not that because
ye have remained I shall choose to flatter you, or that because ye have followed Me I shall
not rebuke the wicked. For neither doth another circumstance abash Me, which is much
more powerful than this to abash a teacher. For he that remaineth affordeth a proof of his
affection, while one that hath been chosen by a teacher, being rejected, attacheth to him a
character for folly among senseless persons. Still neither doth this cause Me to refrain from
My reproofs.” This at least even now the heathen frigidly and senselessly urge against Christ.
For God is not wont to make men good by compulsion and force, neither is His election
and choice compulsory on those who are called,1340 but persuasive.1341 And that thou
mayest learn that the calling compelleth not, consider how many of these who have been
called have come to perdition, so that it is clear that it lieth in our own will1342 also to be
saved, or to perish.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Hearing therefore these things, learn we always to be sober and to watch. For if
when he who was reckoned among that holy band, who had enjoyed so great a gift, who
had wrought miracles, (for he too was with the others who were sent to raise the dead and
to heal lepers,) if when he was seized by the dreadful disease of covetousness, and betrayed
his Master, neither the favors, nor the gifts, nor the being with Christ, nor the attendance
on Him, nor the washing the feet, nor the sharing His table, nor the bearing the bag, availed
him, if these things rather served to help on1343 his punishment, let us also fear lest we ever
through covetousness imitate Judas. Thou betrayest not Christ. But when thou neglectest
the poor man wasting with hunger, or perishing with cold, that man draws upon thee the
same condemnation.1344 When we partake of the Mysteries unworthily, we perish equally
with the Christ-slayers. When we plunder, when we oppress1345 those weaker than ourselves,
we shall draw down upon us severest punishment. And with reason; for how long shall the
love of things present so occupy us, superfluous as they are and unprofitable? since wealth
consists in superfluities, in which no advantage is. How long shall we be nailed to vanities?
How long shall we not look through and away into heaven, not be sober, not be satiated

with these fleeting things of earth, not learn by experience their worthlessness? Let us think
of those who before us have been wealthy; are not all those things a dream? are they not a
shadow, a flower? are they not a stream which floweth by? a story and a tale? Such a man
has been rich, and where now is his wealth? It has gone, has perished, but the sins done by
reason of it stay by him, and the punishment which is because of the sins. Yea, surely if there
were no punishment, if no kingdom were set before us, it were a duty to show regard for
those of like descent and family, to respect those who have like feelings with ourselves. But
now we feed dogs, and many of us wild asses, and bears, and different beasts, while we care
not for a man perishing with hunger; and a thing alien to us is more valued than that which
is of our kin, and our own family less honored than creatures which are not so, nor related
to us.</p>
<p>Is it a fine thing to build one’s self splendid houses, to have many servants, to lie and
gaze at a gilded roof? Why then, assuredly, it is superfluous and unprofitable. For other
buildings there are, far brighter and more majestic than these; on such we must gladden
our eyes, for there is none to hinder us. Wilt thou see the fairest of roofs? At eventide look
upon the starred heaven. “But,” saith some one, “this roof is not mine.” Yet in truth this is
more thine than that other. For thee it was made, and is common to thee and to thy brethren;
the other is not thine, but theirs who after thy death inherit it. The one may do thee the
greatest service, guiding thee by its beauty to its Creator; the other the greatest harm, becoming
thy greatest accuser at the Day of Judgment, inasmuch as it is covered with gold, while
Christ hath not even needful raiment. Let us not, I entreat you, be subject to such folly, let
us not pursue things which flee away, and flee those which endure; let us not betray our
own salvation, but hold fast to our hope of what shall be hereafter; the aged, as certainly
knowing that but a little space of life is left us; the young, as well persuaded that what is left
is not much. For that day cometh so as a thief in the night. Knowing this, let wives exhort
their husbands, and husbands admonish their wives; let us teach youths and maidens, and
all instruct one another, to care not for present things, but to desire those which are to come,
that we may be able also to obtain them; through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and
ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vii. 1, 2</p>
<p>“After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews
sought to kill Him. Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Nothing is worse than envy and malice; through these death entered into the world.
For when the devil saw man honored, he endured not his prosperity, but used every means
to destroy him. ( Wisd. ii. 24.) And from the same root one may everywhere see this same
fruit produced. Thus Abel was slain; thus David, with many other just men, was like to have
been so; from this also the Jews became Christ-slayers. And declaring this the Evangelist
said, “After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He had not power1346 to walk in Jewry,
because the Jews sought to kill Him.” What sayest thou, O blessed John? Had not He “power,”
who was able to do all that He would? He that said, “Whom seek ye?” ( c. xviii. 6 ) and cast
them backward? He who was present, yet not seen ( c. xxi. 4 ), had not He “power”? How
then afterwards did He come among them in the midst of the temple, in the midst of the
feast, when there was an assembly, when they that longed for murder were present, and utter
those sayings which enraged them yet the more? Yea, this at least men marveled at, saying,
“Is not this He, whom they seek to kill? And, lo, He speaketh boldly, and they say nothing
unto Him.” ( Ver. 25, 26.) What mean these riddles? Away with the word!1347 The Evangelist
spake not so that he might be supposed to utter riddles, but to make it plain that He showeth
proofs both of His Godhead and His Manhood. For when he saith, that “He had not power,”
he speaketh of Him as a man, doing many things after the manner of men; but when he
saith, that He stood in the midst of them, and they seized Him not, he showeth to us the
power of the Godhead, (as man He fled, as God He appeared,) and in both cases he speaks
truly. To be in the midst of those who were plotting against Him, and yet not be seized by
them, showed His unrivaled and irresistible nature; to yield strengthened and authenticated
the Dispensation, that neither Paul of Samosata,1348 nor Marcion,1349 nor those affected
with their maladies, might have anything to say. By this then he stoppeth all1350 their mouths.</p>
<p>“After these things was the Jews’ feast of tabernacles.” The words, “after these things,”
mean only, that the writer has here been concise, and has passed over a long interval of time,
as is clear from this circumstance. When Christ sat1351 on the mountain, he saith, that it

was the feast of the Passover;1352 while here the writer mentions the “feast of tabernacles,”
and during the five months hath neither related or taught us anything else, except the miracle
of the loaves, and the sermon made to those who ate them. Yet He ceased not to work miracles,
and to converse, both in the day, and in the evening, and oftentimes at night; at least,
it was thus that He presided over His disciples, as all the Evangelists tell us. Why then have
they omitted that interval? Because it was impossible to recount everything fully, and
moreover, because they were anxious to mention those points which were followed1353 by
any fault-finding or gainsaying of the Jews. There were many circumstances like those which
here are omitted; for that He raised the dead, healed the sick, and was admired, they have
frequently recorded;1354 but when they have anything uncommon to tell, when they have
to describe any charge seemingly put forth against Him, these things they set down; such
as this now, that “His brethren believed Him not.” For a circumstance like this brings with
it no slight suspicion, and it is worth our while to admire their truth-loving disposition,
how they are not ashamed to relate things which seem to bring disgrace upon their Teacher,
but have been even more anxious to report these than other matters. For instance, the writer
having passed by many signs and wonders and sermons, has sprung at once to this.</p>
<p>Ver. 3–5. For, saith he, “His brethren said unto Him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa,
that Thy disciples also may see the works that Thou doest; for there is no man that doeth
anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. Show thyself to the world.
For neither did His brethren believe in Him.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What unbelief, saith some one, is here? They exhort1355 Him to work miracles. It
is great deed; for of unbelief come their words, and their insolence, and their unseasonable
freedom of speech. For they thought, that owing to their relationship, it was lawful1356 for
them to address Him boldly. And their request seems forsooth to be that of friends, but the
words were those of great maliciousness.1357 For in this place they reproach Him with
cowardice and vainglory: since to say, “no man doeth anything in secret,” is the expression
of persons charging Him with cowardice, and suspecting the things done by Him as being
not really done; and to add, that “he seeketh to be known,” was to accuse Him of vainglory.
But observe, I pray you, the power of Christ. Of those who said these things, one became
first Bishop of Jerusalem, the blessed James, of whom Paul saith, “Other of the Apostles saw
I none, save James, the Lord’s brother” ( Gal. i. 19 ); and Judas also is said to have been a

marvelous man. And yet these persons had been present also at Cana, when the wine was
made, but as yet they profited nothing. Whence then had they so great unbelief? From their
evil mind,1358 and from envy; for superiority among kindred is wont somehow to be envied
by such as are not alike exalted. But who are those that they call disciples here? The crowd
that followed Him, not the twelve. What then saith Christ? Observe how mildly He answered;
He said not, “Who are ye that counsel and instruct Me thus?” but,</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “My time is not yet come.”</p>
<p>He here seemeth to me to hint at something other than He expresseth; perhaps in their
envy they designed to deliver Him up to the Jews; and pointing out this to them, He saith,
“My time is not yet come,” that is, “the time of the Cross and the Death, why then hasten
ye to slay Me before the time?”</p>
<p>“But your time is always ready.”</p>
<p>As though He had said, “Though ye be ever with the Jews, they will not slay you who
desire the same things with them; but Me they will straightway wish to kill. So that it is ever
your time to be with them without danger, but My time is when the season of the Cross is
at hand, when I must die.” For that this was His meaning, He showed by what followed.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “The world cannot hate you;” (how should it hate those who desire, and who
run for the same objects as itself?) “but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works
thereof are evil.”</p>
<p>“That is, because I upbraid and rebuke it, therefore I am hated.” From this let us learn
to master our anger, and not to give way to unworthy passion, though they be mean men
who give us counsel. For if Christ meekly bore with unbelievers counseling Him, when their
counsel was improper and not from any good intention, what pardon shall we obtain, who
being but dust and ashes, yet are annoyed with those who counsel us, and deem that we are
unworthily treated, although the persons who do this may be but a little humbler than
ourselves? Observe in this instance how He repelleth their accusation with all gentleness;
for when they say, “Show Thyself to the world,” He replieth, “The world cannot hate you,
but Me the world hateth”; thus removing their accusation. “So far,” He saith, “am I from
seeking honor from men, that I cease not to reprove them, and this when I know that by
this course hatred is produced against and death prepared for Me.” “And where,” asketh
some one, “did He rebuke men?” When did He ever cease to do so? Did He not say, “Think
not that I will accuse you to the Father? There is one that accuseth you, even Moses.” ( c. v.
45.) And again; “I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you”: and “How can ye
believe, who receive honor from men,1359 and seek not the honor that cometh from God
<note type="footnote">1358 al. “deliberate choice.”</note>

<pb n="347"/>
only?” Seest thou how He hath everywhere shown, that it was the open rebuke, not the violation
of the Sabbath, which caused the hatred against Him?</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He send them to the feast, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “Go ye up to the feast: I go not up yet”?</p>
<p>To show that He said these things not as needing them, or desiring to be flattered1360
by them, but permitting them to do what pertained to Jews. “How then,” saith some one,
“went He up after saying, ‘I go not up’?” He said not, once for all,1361 “I go not up,” but,
“now,” that is, “not with you.”</p>
<p>“For My time is not yet fulfilled.”</p>
<p>And yet He was about to be crucified at the coming Passover. “How then went He not
up also? for if He went not up because the time was not yet come, He ought not to have
gone up at all.” But He went not up for this purpose, that He might suffer, but that He might
instruct them. “But wherefore secretly? since He might by going openly both have been
amidst them, and have restrained their unruly impulses as He often did.” It was because He
would not do this continually. Since had He gone up openly, and again blinded them,1362
He would have made His Godhead to shine through in a greater degree, which at present
behooved not, but He rather concealed it.1363 And since they thought that His remaining
was from cowardice, He showeth them the contrary, and that it was from confidence, and
a dispensation,1364 and that knowing beforehand the time when He should suffer, He would,
when it should at length be at hand, be most desirous of going up to Jerusalem. And methinks
by saying, “Go ye up,” He meant, “Think not that I compel you to stay with Me against your
will,” and this addition of, “My time is not yet fully come,” is the expression of one declaring
that miracles must be wrought and sermons spoken, so that greater multitudes might believe,
and the disciples be made more steadfast by seeing the boldness and the sufferings of their
Master.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Learn we then, from what hath been said, His kindness and gentleness; “Learn of
Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart” ( Matt. xi. 29 ); and let us cast away1365 all bitterness.
If any exalt himself against us, let us be humble; if any be bold, let us wait upon him; if any
bite and devour us with mocks and jests, let us not be overcome; lest in defending ourselves
we destroy ourselves. For wrath is a wild beast, a wild beast keen and angry. Let us then repeat
to ourselves1366 soothing charms drawn from the holy Scripture, and say, “Thou art earth

and ashes.” “Why is earth and ashes proud?” ( Ecclus. x. 9 ), and, “The sway of his fury shall
be his destruction” ( Ecclus. i. 22 ): and, “The wrathful man is not comely” ( Prov. xi. 25 ,
LXX.); for there is nothing more shameful, nothing uglier than a visage inflamed with anger.
As when you stir up mud there is an ill savor, so when a soul is disturbed by passion there
is great indecency and unpleasantness. “But,” saith some one, “I endure not insult from
mine enemies.” Wherefore? tell me. If the charge be true, then thou oughtest, even before
the affront, to have been pricked at heart, and thank thine enemy for his rebukes; if it be
false, despise1367 it. He hath called thee poor, laugh at him; he hath called thee base-born
and foolish, then mourn for him; for “He that saith to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in
danger of hell fire.” ( Matt. v. 22.) Whenever therefore one insults thee, consider the punishment
that he undergoeth; then shalt thou not only not be angry, but shalt even shed tears
for him. For no man is wroth with one in a fever or inflammation, but pities and weeps for
all such; and such a thing is a soul that is angry. Nay, if even thou desire to avenge thyself,
hold thy peace, and thou hast dealt thine enemy a mortal blow; while if thou addest reviling
to reviling, thou hast kindled a fire. “But,” saith some one, “the bystanders accuse us of
weakness if we hold our peace.” No, they will not condemn your weakness, but admire you
for your wisdom. Moreover, if you are stung by insolence, you become insolent; and being
stung, compel men to think that what hath been said of you is true. Wherefore, tell me, doth
a rich man laugh when he is called poor? Is it not because he is conscious that he is not poor?
if therefore1368 we will laugh at insults, we shall afford the strongest proof that we are not
conscious of the faults alleged. Besides, how long are we to dread the accounts we render
to men? how long are we to despise our common Lord, and be nailed to the flesh? “For
whereas there is among you strife, and envying, and divisions, are ye not carnal?” ( 1 Cor.
iii. 3.) Let us then become spiritual, and bridle this dreadful wild beast. Anger differs nothing
from madness, it is a temporary devil, or rather it is a thing worse than having a devil; for
one that hath a devil may be excused, but the angry man deserves ten thousand punishments,
voluntarily casting himself into the pit of destruction, and before the hell which is to come
suffering punishment from this already, by bringing a certain restless turmoil and never silent1369
storm of fury, through all the night and through all the day, upon the reasonings
of his soul. Let us therefore, that we may deliver ourselves from the punishment here and
the vengeance hereafter, cast out this passion, and show forth all meekness and gentleness,
that we may find rest for our souls both here and in the Kingdom of Heaven. To which may
we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and

<p>John vii. 9, 10</p>
<p>“When He had said these words unto them, He abode still in Galilee. But when His brethren
were gone up, then went He up also unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.”1370</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The things done1371 by Christ after the manner of men, are not so done only to establish
the Incarnation, but also to educate us for virtue. For had He done all as God, how
could we have known, on falling in with such things as we wished not, what we must do?
As, for instance, when He was in this very place, and the Jews would have killed Him, He
came into the midst of them, and so appeased the tumult. Now had He done this continually,
how should we, not being able to do so, and yet falling into the like case, have known in
what way we ought to deal with the matter, whether to perish at once, or even to use some
contrivance1372 in order that the word might go forward? Since, therefore, we who have no
power could not have understood what to do on coming into the midst of our foes, on this
account we are taught this very thing by Him. For, saith the Evangelist, Jesus, “when He
had said these words, abode in Galilee; but when His brethren were gone up, then went He
up also unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.” The expression, “when His
brethren were gone up,” is that of one showing that He chose not to go up with them. On
which account He abode where He was, and manifested not Himself, although they in a
manner urged1373 Him to do so. But why did He, who ever spake openly, do so now “as it
were in secret”? The writer saith not “secretly,” but, “as it were in secret.” For thus, as I have
said, He seemed1374 to be instructing us how to manage matters. And, apart from this,1375
it was not the same to come among them when heated and restive,1376 as to do so afterwards
when the feast was ended.</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “Then the Jews sought Him,1377 and said, Where is He?”
Excellent truly the good deeds at their feasts! they are eager for murder, and wish to
seize Him, even during the feast.1378 At least, in another place they speak thus, “Think ye

that He will not come to the feast?” ( John xi. 56 ); and here they said, “Where is He?”
Through their excessive hatred and enmity they would not even call Him by name. Great
was their reverence towards the feast, great their caution. By occasion of1379 the very feast
they wished1380 to entrap Him!</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him.”</p>
<p>I think they were exasperated by the place where the miracle had been wrought, and
were1381 greatly infuriated and afraid, not so much from anger at what had gone before, as
from fear lest He should again work something similar. But all fell out contrary to what they
desired, and against their will they rendered Him conspicuous.</p>
<p>“And some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay, but He deceiveth the people.”</p>
<p>Methinks the first of these opinions was that of the many, the other that of the rulers
and priests. For to slander Him suited their malice and wickedness. “He deceiveth,” say
they, “the people.” How, tell me? Was it by seeming to work, not really working miracles?
But experience witnesses1382 the contrary.</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Howbeit no man spake openly of Him for fear of the Jews.”</p>
<p>Seest thou everywhere the ruling body corrupted, and the ruled sound indeed in judgment,
but not having that proper courage1383 which a multitude especially lacketh?1384</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up1385 and taught.”</p>
<p>By the delay He made them more attentive; for they who had sought Him on the first
days and said,1386 “Where is He?” when they saw Him suddenly present, observe how they
drew near, and were like to press upon Him as He was speaking, both those who said that
He was a good man, and those who said that He was not such;1387 the former so as to profit
by and admire Him, the latter to lay hold on and detain Him. One party then said, “He deceiveth
the people,” by reason of the teaching and the doctrines, not understanding His
meaning; the other on account of the miracles said, “He is a good man.” He therefore thus

came among them when He had slackened1388 their anger, so that they might hear His
words at leisure, when passion no longer stopped their ears. What He taught, the Evangelist
hath not told us; that He taught marvelously, this only he saith, and that He won1389 and
brought them over. Such was the power of His speech. And they who had said, “He deceiveth
the people,” altered their opinion, “and marveled.” Wherefore also they said,</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?”</p>
<p>Observest thou how the Evangelist showeth here also their marveling to be full of
wickedness? for he saith not, that they admired the teaching, or that they received the words,
but simply that they “marveled.” That is, were thrown into a state of astonishment, and
doubted, saying, “Whence hath this man1390 these things”? when they ought from this very
difficulty to have known that there was nothing merely human in Him. But because they
would not confess1391 this, but stopped at wondering only, hear what He saith.</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “My doctrine is not Mine.”</p>
<p>Again He answereth to their secret thoughts, referring them to the Father, and so desiring
to stop their mouths.</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God, or whether I speak of Myself.”</p>
<p>What He saith is this, “Cast out from yourselves the malice and wrath and envy and
hatred which has without cause been conceived against Me, then there is nothing to hinder
you from knowing that My words are indeed the words of God. For at present these things
cast a darkness over you, and destroy the light of right judgment, while if ye remove them
this shall no longer be your case.” Yet He spake not (plainly) thus, (for so He would have
confounded them exceedingly,) but implied it all by saying, “He that doeth His will shall
know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or whether I speak of Myself”; that is, “whether
I speak anything different and strange and contrary to God.” For, “of Myself” is always put
with this meaning, that “I say nothing except what seemeth good to Him, but all that the
Father willeth, I will also.”</p>
<p>“If any man do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.”</p>
<p>“What meaneth,” “If any man do His will?” “If any man be a lover of the life which is
according to virtue, he shall know the power of the sayings.” “If any man will give heed to
the prophecies, to see whether I speak according to them or not.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> But how is the doctrine His and not His? For He said not, “This doctrine is not
Mine”; but having first said, “it is Mine,” and having claimed it as His own, He then added,
<note type="footnote">1388 χαλάσας, al. χαυνώσας</note>
<note type="footnote">1389 lit. “took.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1390 al. “knoweth he.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1391 al. “reveal.”</note>

<pb n="353"/>
“it is not Mine.” How then can the same thing be both “His” and not “His”? It is “His,” because
He spake it not as one who had been taught; and it is “not His,” because it was the
doctrine of the Father. How then saith He, “All that is the Father’s is Mine, and Mine His”?
( c. xvii. 10.1392) “For if because the doctrine is the Father’s, it is not thine, that other assertion
is false, for according to that it ought to be thine.” But the “is not Mine,” affords a strong
proof that His doctrine and the Father’s are one; as if He had said, “It hath nothing different,
1393 as though it were another’s. For though My Person1394 be different, yet so do I
speak and do as not to be supposed to speak or do anything contrary to the Father, but
rather the very same things that the Father saith and doeth.” Then He addeth another incontrovertible
argument, bringing forward something merely human, and instructing them by
things to which they were accustomed. And what is that?</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory.”</p>
<p>That is, “He that desireth to establish any doctrine of his own, desireth to do so only
that he himself may enjoy the glory.1395 Now if I desire not to enjoy glory, wherefore should
I desire to establish any doctrine of My own? He that speaketh of himself, that is, who
speaketh anything peculiar or different from others, speaketh on this account, that he may
establish his own glory; but if I seek the glory of Him that sent Me, wherefore should I choose
to teach other1396 things?” Seest thou that there was a cause wherefore He said there too
that He “did nothing of Himself”? ( c. v. 19, and viii. 28.) What was it? It was that they might
believe that He desired not the honor of the many. Therefore when His words are lowly, “I
seek,” He saith, “the glory of the Father,” everywhere desiring to persuade them that He
Himself loveth not glory. Now there are many reasons for His using lowly words, as that
He might not be deemed unbegotten, or opposed to God, His being clothed with flesh, the
infirmity of His hearers, that He might teach men to be modest, and to speak no great thing
of themselves: while for speaking lofty words one could only find one reason, the greatness
of His Nature. And if when He said, “Before Abraham was, I am” ( c. viii. 58 ), they were
offended, what would have been their case if they had continually heard high expressions?</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Did not Moses give you the Law? and yet none of you keepeth the Law? Why
go ye about to kill Me?”</p>
<p>“And what connection,” saith some one, “has this, or what has this to do with what was
said before?” The Jews brought against Him two accusations; one, that He broke the Sabbath;
the other, that He called God His Father, making Himself equal with God. And that this

was no imagination of theirs, but His own declared judgment,1397 and that He spake not
as do the many, but in a special and peculiar sense, is clear from this circumstance. Many
often called God their Father; as “Have we not all one Father, hath not one God created us?”
( Mal. ii. 10 ), but not for that was the people equal to God, on which account the hearers
were not offended. As then when the Jews said, “This man is not from God,” He often healed
them,1398 and made defense for the violation of the Sabbath; so now had the sense they assigned
to His words been according to their imagination, not according to His intention,
He would have corrected them, and said, “Why suppose ye Me equal to God? I am not
equal”; yet He said nothing of the kind, but, on the contrary, declared by what followed,
that He is equal. For, “As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the
Son” ( c. v. 21 ); and “That all may honor the Son as they honor the Father”; and “The works
which He doeth, the same doeth the Son likewise;” all these go to establish His equality.
Again, concerning the Law He saith, “Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the
Prophets.” ( Matt. v. 17.) Thus He knoweth how to remove evil suspicions which are in their
minds; but in this place He not only doth not remove, but even confirmeth their suspicion
of His equality. On which account also, when they said in another place, “Thou makest
thyself God,” He did not remove their suspicion, but even confirmed it, saying, “That ye
may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins, He saith to the sick of
the palsy, Take up thy bed, and walk.”1399 ( Matt. ix. 6.) This then He first aimed at, to make
Himself equal with God, showing that He was not God’s adversary, but that He said the
same and taught the same with Him, and afterwards He setteth Himself to1400 the breach
of the Sabbath, saying, “Did not Moses give you the Law, and none of you keepeth the Law?”
As though He had said, “The Law saith, Thou shalt not kill; but ye kill, and yet accuse Me
as transgressing the Law.” But wherefore saith He, “None of you”? Because they all sought
to kill Him. “And if,” He saith, “I even have broken the Law, it was in saving a man, but ye
transgress it for evil. And if My action was even a transgression, yet it was in order to save,
and I ought not to be judged by you who transgress in the greatest matters. For your conduct
is a subverting of the whole Law.” Then also He presseth it farther, although He had said
many things to them before, but at that former time He spake after a loftier manner, and
more suitably to His own dignity, while now He speaketh more humbly. Wherefore? Because
He would not continually irritate them. At present their anger had become intense, and
they went on to murder. And therefore He continueth to check them in these two ways, by
reproving their evil daring, and saying, “Why go ye about to kill Me?” and by modestly

calling Himself, “A Man that hath told you the truth” ( c. viii. 40 ), and by showing that
murderers in heart are not worthy to judge others. And observe both the humility of Christ’s
question, and the insolence of their answer.</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “Thou hast a devil; who goeth about to kill thee?”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> The expression is one of wrath and anger, and of a soul made shameless by an unexpected
reproof, and put to confusion before their time, as they thought.1401 For just as a
sort of robbers who sing over their plots, then when they desire to put him against whom
they are plotting off his guard, effect their object by keeping silence, so also do these. But
He, omitting to rebuke them for this, so as not to make them more shameless, again taketh
in hand His defense with respect to the Sabbath, reasoning with them from the Law. And
observe how prudently. “No wonder,” He saith, “if ye disobey Me, when ye disobey the Law
which ye think ye obey, and which ye hold to have been given you by Moses. It is therefore
no new thing, if ye give not heed to My words.” For because1402 they said, “God spake to
Moses, but as for this fellow we know not whence he is” ( c. ix. 29 ), He showeth that they
were insulting Moses as well as Himself, for Moses gave them the Law, and they obeyed it
not.</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “I have done one work, and ye all marvel.”</p>
<p>Observe how He argueth, where it is necessary to defend Himself, and make His defense
a charge against them.1403 For with respect to that which had been wrought, He introduceth
not the Person of the Father, but His own: “I have done one work.” He would show,1404
that not to have done it would have been to break the Law, and that there are many things
more authoritative1405 than the Law, and that “Moses” endured to receive a command
against1406 the Law, and more authoritative than the Law. For “circumcision” is more authoritative
than the Sabbath, and yet circumcision is not of the Law, but of “the fathers.”
“But I,” He saith, “have done that which is more authoritative and better than circumcision.”
Then He mentioneth not the command of the Law; for instance, that the Priests profane
the Sabbath, as He had said already, but speaketh more largely. The meaning of, “Ye marvel”
( Matt. xii. 5 ) is, “Ye are confused,” “are troubled.” For if the Law was to be lasting, circum-

cision would not have been more authoritative than it. And He said not, “I have done a
thing greater than circumcision,” but abundantly refuteth them by saying,1407</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “If a man receive circumcision.”1408</p>
<p>“Seest thou that the Law is most established when a man breaketh it? Seest thou that
the breaking of the Sabbath is the keeping of the Law? that if the Sabbath were not broken,
the Law must needs have been broken? so that I also have established the Law.” He said not,
“Ye are wroth with Me because I have wrought a thing which is greater than circumcision,”
but having merely mentioned what had been done, He left it to them to judge, whether entire
health was not a more necessary thing than circumcision. “The Law,” He saith, “is broken,
that a man may receive a sign which contributeth nothing to health; are ye vexed and indignant
at its being broken, that one might be freed from so grievous a disease?”</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Judge not according to appearance.”</p>
<p>What is, “according to appearance”? “Do not, since Moses hath the greatest honor
among you, give your decision according to your estimation of persons, but according to
the nature of things; for this is to judge rightly. Wherefore hath no one of you reproved
Moses? Wherefore hath no one disobeyed him when he ordereth that the Sabbath be broken
by a commandment introduced from without into the Law? He alloweth a commandment
to be of more authority than his own Law; a commandment not introduced by the Law, but
from without, which is especially wonderful; while ye who are not lawgivers are beyond
measure jealous for the Law, and defend it. Yet Moses, who ordereth that the Law be broken
by a commandment which is not of the Law, is more worthy of confidence than you.” By
saying then, (I have made) “a whole man (healthy),” He showeth that circumcision also was
“partial” health. And what was the health procured by circumcision? “Every soul,”1409 It
saith, “that is not circumcised, shall be utterly destroyed.” ( Gen. xvii. 14.) “But I have raised
up a man not partially afflicted, but wholly undone.” “Judge not,” therefore, “according to
appearance.”</p>
<p>Be we persuaded that this is1410 said not merely to the men of that time, but to us also,
that in nothing we pervert justice, but do all in its behalf; that whether a man be poor or
rich, we give no heed to persons, but enquire into things. “Thou shalt not pity,”1411 It saith,
“the poor in judgment.” ( Ex. xxiii. 3.) What is meant? “Be not broken down, nor bent,” It
saith, “if he that doth the wrong be a poor man.” Now if you may not favor a poor man,

much less a rich. And this I say not only to you who are judges, but to all men, that they
nowhere pervert justice, but preserve it everywhere pure. “The Lord,” It saith, “loveth
righteousness”; and, “he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.” ( Ps. xi. 7 and 5 , LXX.)
Let us not, I entreat, hate our own souls, nor love unrighteousness. For certainly its profit
in the present world is little1412 or nothing, and for the world to come it brings great damage.
1413 Or rather, I should say, that not even here can we enjoy it; for when we live softly,
yet with an evil conscience, is not this vengeance and punishment? Let us then love righteousness,
and never look aside1414 from that law. For what fruit shall we gain from the
present life, if we depart without having attained unto excellence? What there will help us?
Will friendship, or relations, or this or that man’s favor? What am I saying? this or that
man’s favor? Though we have Noah, Job, or Daniel for a father, this will avail us nothing if
we be betrayed by our own works. One thing alone we need, that is, excellency of soul. This
will be able to carry you safe through, and to deliver you from everlasting fire, this will escort1415
you to the Kingdom of Heaven. To which may we all attain, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vii. 25–27</p>
<p>“Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? But, lo, he
speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is
the very Christ? Howbeit we know this man whence he is.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Nothing is placed in the Holy Scriptures without a reason, for they were uttered by
the Holy Ghost, therefore let us enquire exactly into every point. For it is possible from one
expression to find out the entire meaning (of a passage), as in the case before us. “Many of
them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? But, lo, he speaketh boldly,
and they say nothing unto him.” Now why is added, “them of Jerusalem”? The Evangelist
by this shows, that they who had most enjoyed His mighty miracles were more pitiable than
any; they who had beheld the greatest proof of His Godhead, and yet committed all to the
judgment of their corrupt rulers. For was it not a great proof of it, that men furious and
bent on murder, who went about and sought to kill Him, should be quiet of a sudden, when
they had Him in their hands? Who could have effected this? who thus quenched their absolute
fury? Still after such proofs, observe the folly and the madness of the men. “Is not this he,
whom they seek to kill?” See how they accuse themselves; “whom,” It saith, “they seek to
kill, and yet they say nothing to him.” And not only do they say nothing to Him, but nothing
even when He “speaketh boldly.” For one who spoke boldly and with all freedom would
naturally have the more angered them; but they did nothing. “Do they know indeed that
this is the very Christ?” “What think ye? What opinion give ye?” The contrary, It saith. On
which account they said, “We know this man whence he is.” What malice,1416 what contradiction!
They do not even follow the opinion of their rulers, but bring forward another,
perverse, and worthy of their own folly; “We know him whence he is.”</p>
<p>“But when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence He is.” ( Matt. ii. 4.)</p>
<p>“Yet your rulers when asked replied, that He should be born in Bethlehem.” And others
again said, “God spake unto Moses, but as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.”
( c. ix. 29.) “We know whence he is,” and “we know not whence He is”; observe the words
of drunken men. And again, “Doth Christ come out of Galilee?” ( Ver. 41.) Is He not of “the
town of Bethlehem”? Seest thou that theirs is the decision of madmen? “We know,” and,
“we know not”; “Christ cometh from Bethlehem”; “When Christ cometh, no man knoweth
whence He is.” What can be plainer than this contradiction? For they only looked to one
thing, which was, not to believe. What then is Christ’s reply?</p>
<note type="footnote">1416 al. “perplexity.”</note>

<pb n="359"/>
<p>Ver. 28. “Ye both know Me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of Myself,
but He that sent Me is true, whom ye know not.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And again, “If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also.” ( c. viii.
19.) How then saith He, that they both “know Him,” and “whence He is,” and then, “that
they neither know Him, nor the Father”? He doth not contradict, (away with the thought,)
but is very consistent with Himself. For He speaketh of a different kind of knowledge, when
He saith, “ye know not”; as when He saith, “The sons of Eli were wicked sons, they knew
not the Lord” ( 1 Sam. ii. 12 ); and again, “Israel doth not know Me.” ( Isa. i. 3.) So also Paul
saith, “They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.” ( Tit. i. 16.) It is
therefore possible, “knowing,” “not to know.” This then is what He saith: “If ye know Me,
ye know that I am the Son of God.” For the “whence I am” doth not here denote place. As
is clear from what followeth, “I am not come of Myself, but He that sent Me is true, whom
ye know not,” referring here to the ignorance shown by their works. <del>As Paul saith, “They
profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.”</del> For their fault came not merely
of ignorance, but of wickedness, and an evil will; because even though they knew this, they
chose to be ignorant. But what manner of connection is there here? How is it that He, reproving
them, useth their own words? For when they say, “We know this man whence he
is,” He addeth, “ye both know Me.” Was their expression, “We know him not”? Nay, they
said, “We know him.” But (observe), they by saying the, “We know whence he is,” declared
nothing else than that He was “of the earth,” and that He was “the carpenter’s son”; but He
led them up to heaven, saying, “Ye know whence I am,” that is, not thence whence ye suppose,
but from that place whence He that sent Me (hath sent Me). For to say, “I am not come of
Myself,” intimateth to them, that they knew that He was sent by the Father, though they did
not disclose it.1417 So that He rebuketh them in a twofold manner; first, what they said in
secret He published aloud, so as to put them to shame; after that He revealed also what was
in their hearts. As though He had said, “I am not one of the abjects, nor of those who come
for nothing, but He ‘that sent Me is true, whom ye know not.’” What meaneth,“He that sent
Me is true”? “If He be true, He hath sent Me for the truth; if He be true, it is probable that
He who is sent is true also.” This also He proveth in another way, vanquishing them with
their own words. For whereas they had said, “When Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence
He is,” He proveth from this that He Himself is the Christ. They used the words, “No man
knoweth,” with reference to distinction of some definite locality; but from the same words
He showeth Himself to be the Christ, because He came from the Father; and everywhere
He witnesseth that He alone hath the knowledge of the Father, saying, “Not that any man
hath seen the Father, save He which is from the Father.”1418 ( c. vi. 46.) And His words ex-
<note type="footnote">1417 ἐ ξεκάλυπτον</note>
<note type="footnote">1418 “of God,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="360"/>
asperated them; for to tell them, “Ye know Him not,” and to rebuke them because knowing
they pretended to be ignorant, was sufficient to sting and annoy them.</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “Then they sought to take Him, and no man laid his hand upon Him, because
His hour was not yet come.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that they are invisibly restrained, and their anger bridled? But wherefore
saith It not, that He had restrained them invisibly, but, “Because His hour was not yet come”?
The Evangelist was minded to speak more humanly and in a lowlier strain, so that Christ
might be deemed to be also Man. For because Christ everywhere speaketh of sublime matters,
he therefore intersperseth expressions of this kind. And when Christ saith, “I am from Him,”
He speaketh not as a Prophet who learneth, but as seeing Him, and being with Him.</p>
<p>Ver. 29. “I know Him,” He saith, “for I am from Him, and He hath sent Me.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He continually seeketh to prove the, “I am not come of Myself,” and,
“He that sent Me is true,” striving not to be thought an enemy of God? And observe how
great is the profit of the humility of His words; for, it saith, after this many said,
Ver. 31. “When Christ cometh, will He do more miracles than these which this man
hath done?”</p>
<p>How many were the miracles? In truth, there were three, that of the wine, that of the
paralytic, and that of the nobleman’s son; and the Evangelist hath related no more. From
which circumstance it is plain, as I have often said, that the writers pass by most of them,
and discourse to us of those alone on account of which the rulers ill-treated Him. “Then
they sought to take Him,” and kill Him. Who “sought”? Not the multitude, who had no
desire of rule, nor could be made captives by malice; but the priests. For they of the multitude
said, “When Christ cometh, will He do more miracles?” Yet neither was this sound faith,
but, as it were, the idea of a promiscuous1419 crowd; for to say, “When He cometh,” was
not the expression of men firmly persuaded that He was the Christ. We may either understand
the words thus, or that they were uttered by the multitudes when they came together.
“Since,” they may have said, “our rulers are taking every pains to prove that this man is not
the Christ, let us suppose that he is not the Christ; will the Christ be better than he?” For,
as I ever repeat, men of the grosser sort are led in not by doctrine, nor by preaching, but by
miracles.</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “The Pharisees heard the people murmuring,1420 and sent1421 servants to take
Him.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that the violation of the Sabbath was a mere pretense? and that what most
stung them was this murmuring? For here, though they had no fault to find with Him for
<note type="footnote">1419 χυδαίου</note>
<note type="footnote">1420 “murmuring such things concerning Him,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1421 “the Pharisees and Chief Priests sent,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="361"/>
anything said or done, they desired to take Him because of the multitude. They dared not
do it themselves, suspecting danger, but sent their hired servants.1422 Alas! for their tyranny
and their madness, or rather, I should say, for their folly. After having often attempted
themselves, and not prevailed, they committed the matter to servants, simply satisfying their
anger. Yet He had spoken much at the pool ( c. v.), and they had done nothing of the kind;
they sought indeed occasion, but they attempted not, while here they can endure it no longer,
when the multitude is about to run to Him. What then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “Yet a little while am I with you.” Having power to bow and terrify His hearers,
He uttereth words full of humility. As though He had said, “Why are ye eager to persecute
and kill Me? Wait a little while, and even though you should be eager to keep Me back, I
shall not endure it.” That no one should (as they did) suppose that the, “Yet a little while
am I with you,” denoted a common death, that no one might suppose this, or that He
wrought1423 nothing after death, He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “And where I am, thither ye cannot come.”</p>
<p>Now had He been about to continue in death, they might have gone to Him, for to that
place we all depart. His words therefore bent the simpler portion of the multitude, terrified
the bolder, made the more intelligent anxious to hear Him, since but little time was now
left, and since it was not in their power always to enjoy this teaching. Nor did He merely
say, “I am here,” but, “I am with you,” that is, “Though ye persecute, though ye drive Me
away, yet for a little while I shall not cease dispensing what is for your good, saying and recommending
the things that relate to your salvation.”</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “And I go unto Him that sent Me.” This was enough to terrify and throw them
into an agony. For that they should stand in need of Him, He declareth also.</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “Ye shall seek Me,” He saith, (not only “ye shall not forget Me,” but ye shall
even “seek Me,”) “and shall not find Me.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And when did the Jews “seek Him”? Luke saith that the women mourned over Him,
and it is probable that many others, both at the time and when the city was taken, remembered
Christ and His miracles, and sought His presence. ( Luke xxiii. 49.) Now all this
He added, desiring to attract them. For the facts that the time left was short, that He should
after His departure be regretfully desired by them, and that they should not then be able to
find Him, were all together sufficient to persuade them to come to Him. For had it not been
that His presence should with regret be desired by them, He would not have seemed to them
to be saying any great thing; if, again, it was about to be desired, and they able to find Him,
neither so would this have disturbed them. Again, had He been about to stay with them a
long time, so also they would have been remiss. But now He in every way compelleth and
<note type="footnote">1422 or, “sent their s. to be exposed” (ἐ κδότους).</note>
<note type="footnote">1423 ἐ νήργει</note>

<pb n="362"/>
terrifieth them. And the, “I go to Him that sent Me,” is the expression of one declaring that
no harm will happen to Him from their plotting, and that His Passion was voluntary.
Wherefore now He uttered two predictions, that after a little while He should depart, and
that they should not come to Him; a thing which belonged not to human intelligence, the
foretelling His own death. Hear for instance, David saying, “Lord, make me to know mine
end and the number of my days, what it is, that I may know what time I have.”1424 ( Ps.
xxxix. 4.) There is no man at all that knoweth this; and by one1425 the other is confirmed.
And I think that He speaketh this covertly to the servants, and directeth His discourse to
them, thus specially attracting them, by showing them that He knew the cause of their arrival.
As though He had said, “Wait a little, and I shall depart.”</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go?”</p>
<p>Yet they who had wished to be rid of Him, who did all in their power not to see Him,
ought not to have asked this question, but to have said, “we are glad of it, when will the departure
take place?” but they were somewhat affected at His words, and with foolish suspicion
question one another, “whither will he go?”</p>
<p>“Will he go unto the dispersion of the Gentiles?”1426</p>
<p>What is, “the dispersion of the Gentiles”? The Jews gave this name to other nations,
because they were everywhere scattered and mingled fearlessly with one another. And this
reproach they themselves afterwards endured, for they too were a “dispersion.” For of old
all their nation was collected into one place, and you could not anywhere find a Jew, except
in Palestine only; wherefore they called the Gentiles a “dispersion,” reproaching them, and
boasting concerning themselves. What then meaneth, “Whither I go ye cannot come”? For
all nations at that time had intercourse with them, and there were Jews everywhere. He
would not therefore, if He had meant the Gentiles, have said, “Where ye cannot come.”
After saying, “Will he go to the dispersion of the Gentiles?” they did not add, “and ruin,”
but, “and teach them.” To such a degree had they abated their anger, and believed His words;
for they would not, had they not believed, have enquired among themselves what the saying
was.</p>
<p>These words were spoken indeed to the Jews, but fear there is lest they be suited to us
also, that “where He is” we “cannot come” on account of our life being full of sins. For
concerning the disciples He saith, “I will that they also be with Me where I am” ( c. xvii. 24
), but concerning ourselves, I dread lest the contrary be said, that, “Where I am, ye cannot
come.” For when we act contrary to the commandments, how can we go to that place? Even
in the present life, if any soldier act unworthily towards his king, he will not be able to see

the king, but being deprived of his authority will suffer the severest punishment; if therefore
we steal, or covet, if we wrong or strike others, if we work not deeds of mercy, we shall not
be able to go thither, but shall suffer what happened to the virgins. For where He was, they
were not able to enter in, but retired, their lamps having gone out, that is, grace having left
them. For we can, if we will, increase the brightness of that flame which we received
straightway1427 by the grace of the Spirit; but if we will not do this, we shall lose it, and when
that is quenched, there will be nothing else than darkness in our souls; since, as while a lamp
is burning the light is strong, so when it is extinguished there is nothing but gloom.
Wherefore the Apostle saith, “Quench not the Spirit.” ( 1 Thess. v. 19.) And It is quenched
when It hath not oil, when there is any violent gust of wind, when It is cramped and confined,
(for so fire is quenched,) and It is cramped by worldly cares, and quenched by evil desires.
In addition to the causes we have mentioned, nothing quencheth It so much as inhumanity,
cruelty, and rapine. For when, besides having no oil, we pour upon it cold water, (for covetousness
is this, which chills with despondency the souls of those we wrong,) whence shall
it be kindled again? We shall depart, therefore, carrying dust and ashes with us, and having
much smoke to convict us of having had lamps and of having extinguished them; for where
there is smoke, there needs must have been fire which hath been quenched. May none of
us ever hear that word, “I know you not.” ( Matt. xxv. 12.) And whence shall we hear that
word, but from this, if ever we see a poor man, and are as though we saw him not? If we will
not know Christ when He is an hungered, He too will not know us when we entreat His
mercy. And with justice; for how shall he who neglects the afflicted, and gives not of that
which is his own, how shall he seek to receive of that which is not his own? Wherefore, I
entreat you, let us do and contrive everything, so that oil fail not us, but that we may trim
our lamps, and enter with the Bridegroom into the bride-chamber. To which may we all
attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>John vii. 37, 38</p>
<p>“In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let
him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out
of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> They who come to the divine preaching and give heed to the faith, must manifest
the desire of thirsty men for water, and kindle in themselves a similar longing; so will they
be able also very carefully to retain what is said. For as thirsty men, when they have taken
a bowl, eagerly drain it and then desist, so too they who hear the divine oracles if they receive
them thirsting, will never be weary until they have drunk them up. For to show that men
ought ever to thirst and hunger, “Blessed,” It saith, “are they which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness” ( Matt. v. 6 ); and here Christ saith, “If any man thirst, let him come
unto Me, and drink.” What He saith is of this kind, “I draw no man to Me by necessity and
constraint; but if any hath great zeal, if any is inflamed with desire, him I call.”</p>
<p>But why hath the Evangelist remarked that it was “on the last day, that great day”? For
both the first day and the last were “great,” while the intermediate days they spent rather in
enjoyment. Wherefore then saith he, “in the last day”? Because on that day they were all
collected together. For on the first day He came not, and told the reason to His brethren,
nor yet on the second and third days saith He anything of this kind, lest His words should
come to nought, the hearers being about to run into indulgence. But on the last day when
they were returning home He giveth them supplies1428 for their salvation, and crieth aloud,
partly by this showing to us His boldness, and partly for the greatness of the multitude. And
to show that He spake not of material drink, He addeth, “He that believeth on Me, as the
Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” By “belly” he here
meaneth the heart, as also in another place It saith, “And Thy Law in the midst of my belly.”
( Ps. xl. 10 ; Theodotion.) But where hath the Scripture said, that “rivers of living water shall
flow from his belly”? Nowhere. What then meaneth, “He that believeth on Me, as the
Scripture saith”? Here we must place a stop, so that the, “rivers shall flow from his belly,”
may be an assertion of Christ.1429 For because many said, “This is the Christ”; and, “When
the Christ cometh will He do more miracles?” He showeth that it behooveth to have a correct
<note type="footnote">1428 ἐ φόδια</note>

<pb n="365"/>
knowledge, and to be convinced not so much from the miracles as from the Scriptures.
Many, in fact, who even saw Him working marvels received Him not as Christ, and were
ready to say, “Do not the Scriptures say that Christ cometh of the seed of David?” and on
this they 1430 continually dwelt. He then, desiring to show that He did not shun the proof
from the Scriptures, again referreth them to the Scriptures. He had said before, “Search the
Scriptures” ( c. v. 39 ); and again, “It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be taught of
God” ( c. vi. 45 ); and, “Moses accuseth you” ( c. v. 45 ); and here,“As the Scripture hath
said, rivers shall flow from his belly,” alluding to the largeness and abundance of grace. As
in another place He saith, “A well of water springing up unto eternal life” ( c. iv. 14 ), that
is to say, “he shall possess much grace”; and elsewhere He calleth it, “eternal life,” but here,
“living water.” He calleth that “living” which ever worketh; for the grace of the Spirit, when
it hath entered into the mind and hath been established, springeth up more than any fountain,
faileth not, becometh not empty, stayeth not. To signify therefore at once its unfailing supply
and unlimited1431 operation, He hath called it “a well” and “rivers,” not one river but
numberless; and in the former case He hath represented its abundance by the expression,
“springing.” And one may clearly perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom of
Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of Paul, how nothing bare, nothing withstood
them, not the anger of multitudes, not the risings up of tyrants, not the plots of devils, not
daily deaths, but as rivers borne along with a great rushing sound, so they went on their way
hurrying all things with them.</p>
<p>Ver. 39. “But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive;
for the Holy Ghost was not yet given.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> How then did the Prophets prophesy and work those ten thousand wonders? For
the Apostles cast not out devils by the Spirit, but by power received from Him; as He saith
Himself, “If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?” (
Matt. xii. 27.) And this He said, signifying that before the Crucifixion1432 not all cast out
devils by the Spirit, but that some did so by the power received from Him. So when1433 He
was about to send them, He said, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost” ( c. xx. 22 ); and again, “The
Holy Ghost came upon them” ( Acts xix. 6 ), and then they wrought miracles. But when1434
He was sending them, the Scripture said not, that “He gave to them the Holy Ghost,” but
that He gave to them “power,” saying, “Cleanse the lepers, cast out devils, raise the dead,
freely ye have received, freely give.” ( Matt. x. 1, 8.) But in the case of the Prophets, all allow

that the Gift was that of the Holy Spirit. But this Grace was stinted and departed and failed
from off the earth, from the day in which it was said, “Your house is left unto you desolate”
( Matt. xxiii. 38 ); and even before that day its dearth had begun, for there was no longer
any prophet among them, nor did Grace visit their holy1435 things. Since then the Holy
Ghost had been withheld, but was for the future to be shed forth abundantly, and since the
beginning of this imparting was after the Crucifixion, not only as to its abundance, but also
as to the increased greatness of the gifts, (for the Gift was more marvelous, as when It saith,
“Ye know not what Spirit ye are of” ( Luke ix. 55 ); and again, “For ye have not received the
Spirit of bondage, but the Spirit of adoption” ( Rom. viii. 15 ); and the men of old possessed
the Spirit themselves, but imparted It not to others, while the Apostles filled tens of thousands
with It,) since then, I say, they were to receive this Gift, but It was not yet given, for this
cause he addeth, “The Holy Ghost was not yet.” Since then the Lord spoke of this grace,1436
the Evangelist hath said, “For the Holy Ghost was not yet,” that is, “was not yet given,”</p>
<p>“Because Jesus was not yet glorified.”</p>
<p>Calling the Cross, “glory.” For since we were enemies, and had sinned, and fallen short
of the gift of God, and were haters of God, and since grace was a proof of our reconciliation,
and since a gift is not given to those who are hated, but to friends and those who have been
well-pleasing; it was therefore necessary that the Sacrifice should first be offered for us, that
the enmity (against God) which was in our flesh should be done away, that we should become
friends of God, and so receive the Gift. For if this was done with respect to the promise made
to Abraham, much more with respect to grace. And this Paul hath declared, saying, “If they
which are of the Law be heirs, faith is made void—because the Law worketh wrath.” ( Rom.
iv. 14, 15.) What he saith, is of this kind: God “promised that He would give the earth to
Abraham and to his seed: but his descendants were unworthy of the promise, and of their
own deeds could not be well-pleasing unto God. On this account came in faith, an easy action,
that it might draw grace unto it, and that the promise might not fail. And It saith,</p>
<p>“Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure.”
( Rom. iv. 16.) Wherefore it is by grace, since by their own labors they prevailed not.</p>
<p>But wherefore after saying, “according to the Scriptures,”1437 did He not add the testimony?
Because their mind was corrupt; for,</p>
<p>Ver. 40–42.1438 “Some said, This is the Prophet. Others said, He deceiveth the people;1439
others said, Christ cometh not from Galilee, but from the village of Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>Others said, “When Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence He is” ( ver. 27 ); and
there was a difference of opinion, as might be expected in a confused1440 multitude; for not
attentively did they listen to His words, nor for the sake of learning. Wherefore He maketh
them no answer; yet they said, “Doth Christ come out of Galilee?” And He had praised, as
being “an Israelite indeed,” Nathanael, who had said in a more forcible and striking manner,
“Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” ( c. i. 46.) But then these men, and they
who said to Nicodemus, “Search and look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet” ( ver. 52 ),
said it not seeking to learn, but merely to overturn the opinion concerning Christ. Nathanael
said this, being a lover of the truth, and knowing exactly all the ancient histories; but they
looked only to one thing, and that was to remove the opinion that He was the Christ, on
which account He revealed nothing to them. For they who even contradicted themselves,
and said at one time, “No man knoweth whence He cometh,” at another, “From Bethlehem,”
would manifestly even if they had been informed have opposed Him. For be it that they
knew not the place of His birth, that He was from Bethlehem, because of His dwelling1441
in Nazareth, (yet this cannot be allowed, for He was not born there,) were they ignorant of
His race also, that He was “of the house and lineage of David”? How then said they, “Doth
not Christ come of the seed of David?” ( Ver. 42.) Because they wished to conceal even this
fact by that question, saying all that they said with malicious intent. Why did they not come
to Him and say, “Since we admire thee in other respects, and thou biddest us believe thee
according to the Scriptures, tell us how it is that the Scriptures say that Christ must come
from Bethlehem, when thou art come from Galilee?” But they said nothing of the kind, but
all in malice. And to show that they spoke not enquiringly, nor as desiring to learn, the
Evangelist straightway hath added, that,</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “Some of them would have taken Him, but no man laid his hand upon Him.”
This, if nothing else, might have been sufficient to cause compunction in them, but they
felt it not, as the Prophet saith, “They were cleft asunder, and were not pricked in heart.” (
Ps. xxxv. 15 , LXX.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Such a thing is malice! it will give way to nothing, it looks to one thing only, and
that is, to destroy the person against whom it plotteth. But what saith the Scripture? “Whoso
diggeth a pit for his neighbor, shall fall into it himself.” ( Prov. xxvi. 27.) Which was the case
then. For they desired to kill Him, to stop, as they thought, His preaching; the result was
the opposite. For the preaching flourishes by the grace of Christ, while all that was theirs is
quenched and perished; they have lost their country, their freedom, their security, their
worship, they have been deprived of all their prosperity, and are become slaves and captives.</p>

<p>Knowing then this, let us never plot against others, aware that by so doing we whet the
sword against ourselves, and inflict upon ourselves the deeper wound. Hath any one grieved
thee, and desireth thou to avenge thyself on him? Avenge not thyself; so shalt thou be able
to be avenged; but if thou avenge thyself, thou art not avenged. Think not that this is a riddle,
but a true saying. “How, and in what way?” Because if thou avenge not thyself on him, thou
makest God his enemy; but if thou avenge thyself, no longer so. “Vengeance is Mine, I will
repay, saith the Lord.” ( Rom. xii. 19.) For if we have servants, and they having quarreled1442
with each other, do not give place to us for judgment and for punishment, but take it upon
themselves; though they come to us ten thousand times, we not only shall not avenge them,
but shall even be wroth with them, saying, “Thou runaway, thou flogging-post, thou
oughtest to have submitted all to us, but since thou hast prevented us and avenged thyself,
trouble us no farther”; much more shall God, who hath bidden us commit all unto Him,
say this. For how can it be otherwise than absurd, when we demand from our servants so
much minding of wisdom and obedience, but will not yield to our Master in those matters
in which we desire our domestics to yield to us? This I say because of your readiness to inflict
punishment one upon another. The truly wise man ought not to do this even, but to pardon
and forgive offenses, though there were not that great reward proposed, the receiving in
return forgiveness. For, tell me, if thou condemnest one who hath sinned, wherefore dost
thou sin thyself, and fall into the same fault? Hath he insulted? Insult not thou again, or
thou hast insulted thyself. Hath he struck? Strike not thou again, for then there is no differ-
ence between you. Hath he vexed thee? Vex him not again, for the profit is nothing, and
thou wilt in thy turn be placed on an equality with those who have wronged thee. Thus, if
thou bear with meekness and gentleness, thou shalt be able to reprove thine enemy, to shame
him, to weary1443 him of being wroth. No man cures evil with evil, but evil with good. These
rules of wisdom give some of the heathen; now if there be such wisdom among the foolish
heathen, let us be ashamed to show ourselves inferior to them. Many of them have been
injured, and have borne it; many have been maliciously accused, and not defended themselves;
have been plotted against, and have repaid by benefits. And there is no small fear lest
some of them be found in their lives to be greater than we, and so render our punishment
severer. For when we who have partaken of the Spirit, we who look for the Kingdom, who
follow wisdom for the sake of heavenly things,1444 who fear (not) hell, and are bidden to
become angels, who enjoy the Mysteries; when we reach not to the virtue unto which they
have attained, what pardon1445 shall we have? If we must go beyond the Jews, (for, “Except

your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in
no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven”— Matt. v. 20 ,) much more the heathen; if the
Pharisees, much more the unbelievers. Since if when we go not beyond the righteousness
of the Jews, the Kingdom is shut against us, how shall we be able to attain unto it when we
prove ourselves worse than the heathen? Let us then cast out all bitterness, and wrath, and
anger. To speak “the same things, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe,” (
Philip. iii. 1.) For physicians also often use the same remedy, and we will not cease from
sounding the same things in your ears, reminding, teaching, exhorting, for great is the tumult
of worldly things, and it causes in us forgetfulness, and we have need of continual teaching.
Let us then, in order that we meet not together in this place uselessly and in vain, exhibit
the proof1446 which is by works, that so we may obtain the good things to come, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John vii. 45, 46</p>
<p>“Then came the officers to the Chief Priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have
ye not brought him? The officers answered, Never man spake like this Man.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> There is nothing clearer, nothing simpler than the truth, if we deal not perversely;
just as (on the other hand) if we deal perversely, nothing is more difficult. For behold, the
Scribes and Pharisees, who seemed forsooth to be wiser than other men, being ever with
Christ for the sake of plotting against Him, and beholding His miracles, and reading the
Scriptures, were nothing profited, but were even harmed; while the officers, who could not
claim one of these privileges, were subdued by one single sermon, and they who had gone
forth to bind Him, came back bound themselves by wonder. We must not only marvel at
their understanding, that they needed not signs, but were taken by the teaching alone; (for
they said not, “Never man wrought miracles thus,” but, “Never man spake thus”;) we must
not, I say, merely marvel at their understanding, but also at their boldness, that they spake
thus to those that had sent them, to the Pharisees, to His enemies, to men who were doing
all with a view to gratify their enmity. “The officers,” saith the Evangelist, “came, and the
Pharisees said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?” To “come” was a far greater deed
than to have remained, for in the latter case they would have been rid of the annoyance of
these men, but now they become heralds of the wisdom of Christ, and manifested their
boldness in greater degree. And they say not, “We could not become of the multitude, for
they gave heed unto Him as unto a prophet”; but what? “Never man spake as this Man.”
Yet they might have alleged that, but they show their right feeling. For theirs was the saying
not only of men admiring Him, but blaming their masters, because they had sent them to
bind Him whom it behooved rather to hear. Yet they had not heard a sermon either, but a
short one; for when the long mind is impartial, there is no need of long arguments. Such a
thing is truth. What then say the Pharisees? When they ought to have been pricked at the
heart, they, on the contrary, retort a charge on the officers, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 47. “Are ye also deceived?”</p>
<p>They still speak them fair, and do not express themselves harshly, dreading lest the
others should entirely separate themselves, yet nevertheless they give signs of anger, and
speak sparingly. For when they ought to have asked what He spake, and to have marveled
at the words, they do not so, (knowing that they might have been captivated,) but reason
with them from a very foolish argument;</p>
<p>Ver. 48. “Wherefore,” saith one, “hath none1447 of the rulers1448 believed on Him?”</p>
<p>1447 “Hath any,” N.T.</p>
<p>1448 “or of the Pharisees,” N.T.</p>
<pb n="371"/>
<p>Dost thou then make this a charge against Christ, tell me, and not against the unbelievers?</p>
<p>Ver. 49. “But the1449 people,” saith one, “which knoweth not the Law, are accursed.”</p>
<p>Then is the charge against you the heavier, because the people believed, and ye believed
not. They acted like men that knew the Law; how then are they accursed? It is ye that are
accursed, who keep not the Law, not they, who obey the Law. Neither was it right, on the
evidence of unbelievers, to slander one in whom they believed not, for this is an unjust mode
of acting. For ye also believed not God, as Paul saith; “What if some did not believe? shall
their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect? God forbid.” ( Rom. iii. 3, 4.) For the
Prophets ever rebuked them, saying, “Hear, ye rulers of Sodom”; and, “Thy rulers are disobedient”
( Isa. i. 10, 23 ); and again, “Is it not for you to know judgment?” ( Mic. iii. 1.)
And everywhere they attack them vehemently. What then? Shall one blame God for this?
Away with the thought. This blame is theirs. And what other proof can a man bring of your
not knowing the Law than your not obeying it? For when they had said, “Hath any of the
rulers believed on him?” and, “These who know not the Law,” Nicodemus in fair consequence
upbraids them, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 51. “Doth our1450 law judge any man before it hear him?”</p>
<p>He showeth that they neither know the Law, nor do the Law; for if that Law commandeth
to kill no man without first hearing him, and they before hearing were eager for this deed,
they were transgressors of the Law. And because they said, “None of the rulers hath believed
on him” ( ver. 50 ), therefore the Evangelist informs us that Nicodemus was “one of them,”
to show that even rulers believed on Him; for although they showed not yet fitting boldness,
still they were becoming attached1451 to Christ. Observe how cautiously he rebukes them;
he said not, “Ye desire to kill him, and condemn the man for a deceiver without proof”; but
spake in a milder way, hindering their excessive violence, and their inconsiderate and
murderous disposition. Wherefore he turns his discourse to the Law, saying, “Except it hear
him carefully, and know what he doeth.” So that not a bare “hearing,” but “careful hearing”
is required. For the meaning of, “know what he doeth,” is, “what he intendeth,” “on what
account,” “for what purpose,” “whether for the subversion of the order of things and as an
enemy.” Being therefore perplexed, because they had said, “None of the rulers hath believed
on him,” they addressed him, neither vehemently, nor yet with forbearance. For tell me,
after he had said, “The Law judgeth no man,” how doth it follow that they should say,</p>
<p>Ver. 52. “Art thou also of Galilee?”</p>
<note type="footnote">1449 “this,” N.T.1450 al. “your.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1451 ᾠ κειοῦντο</note>

<pb n="372"/>
<p><del>2.</del> When they ought to have shown that they had not sent to summon Him without
judgment, or that it was not fitting to allow Him speech, they take the reply rather in a rough
and angry manner.</p>
<p>“Search, and look: for out of Galilee hath arisen no prophet.”</p>
<p>Why, what had the man said? that Christ was a prophet? No; he said, that He ought not
to be slain unjudged; but they replied insolently, and as to one who knew nothing of the
Scriptures; as though one had said, “Go, learn,” for this is the meaning of, “Search, and
look.” What then did Christ? Since they were continually dwelling upon Galilee and “The
Prophet,” to free all men from this erroneous suspicion, and to show that He was not one
of the prophets, but the Master of the world, He said,</p>
<p>Chap. viii. ver. 12.1452 “I am the light of the world.”</p>
<p>Not “of Galilee,” not of Palestine, nor of Judæa. What then say the Jews?</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Thou bearest record of thyself, thy record is not true.”</p>
<p>Alas! for their folly, He continually referred them to the Scriptures, and now they say,
“Thou bearest record of thyself.” What was the record He bare? “I am the light of the world.”
A great thing to say, great of a truth, but it did not greatly amaze them, because He did not
now make Himself equal to the Father, nor assert that He was His Son, nor that He was
God, but for a while calleth Himself “a light.” They indeed desired to disprove this also, and
yet this was a much greater thing than to say,</p>
<p>“He that followeth Me, shall not walk in darkness.”</p>
<p>Using the words “light” and “darkness” in a spiritual sense, and meaning thereby
“abideth not in error.” In this place He draweth on Nicodemus, and bringeth him in as
having spoken very boldly, and praiseth the servants who had also done so. For to “cry
aloud,”1453 is the act of one desirous to cause that they also should hear. At the same time
He hinteth at these1454 who were secretly contriving treacheries, being both in darkness
and error, but that they should not prevail over the light. And He remindeth Nicodemus of
the words which He had uttered before, “Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither
cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.” ( c. iii. 20.) For since they had asserted
that none of the rulers had believed on Him, therefore He saith, that “he that doeth evil
cometh not to the light,” to show that their not having come proceedeth not from the
weakness of the light, but from their own perverse will.</p>
<p>“They answered and said unto Him, Dost thou bear witness to thyself?”
What then saith He?</p>

<p>Ver. 14. “Though I bear record of Myself, My record is true; for I know whence I come,
and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come.”</p>
<p>What He had before said,1455 these men bring forward as if it had been specially1456
asserted. What then doth Christ? To refute this, and to show that He used those expressions
as suitable to them and to their suspicions, who supposed Him to be a mere man, He saith,
“Though I bear record of Myself, My record is true, for I know whence I come.” What is
this? “I am of God, am God, the Son of God, and God Himself is a faithful witness unto
Himself, but ye know Him not; ye willingly err,1457 knowing ye pretend not to know, but
say all that ye say according to mere human imagination, choosing to understand nothing
beyond what is seen.”</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “Ye judge after the flesh.”</p>
<p>As to live after the flesh is to live badly, so to judge after the flesh is to judge unjustly.
“But I judge no man.”</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “And yet if I judge, My judgment is true.”1458</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind; “Ye judge unjustly.” “And if,” saith some one, “we judge
unjustly, why dost Thou not rebuke us? why dost Thou not punish us? why dost Thou not
condemn us?” “Because,” He saith, “I came not for this.” This is the meaning of, “I judge
no man; yet if I judge, My judgment is true.” “For had I been willing to judge, ye would have
been among the condemned. And this I say, not judging you. Yet neither do I tell you that
I say it, not judging you, as though I were not confident that had I judged you, I should have
convicted you; since if I had judged you, I must justly have condemned you. But now the
time of judgment is not yet.” He alluded also to the judgment to come, saying,</p>
<p>“I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent Me.”</p>
<p>Here He hinted, that not He alone condemneth them, but the Father also. Then He
concealed this, by leading them to His own testimony.</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “It is written in your Law, that the testimony of two men is true.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> What would the heretics say here? (They would say,) “How is he better than man,
if we take what he hath said simply? For this rule is laid down in the case of men, because
no man by himself is trustworthy. But in the case of God, how can one endure such a mode
of speaking? How then is the word ‘two’ used? Is it because they are two, or because being
men they are therefore two? If it is because they are two, why did he not betake himself to
John, and say, I bear witness of myself, and John beareth witness of me? Wherefore not to
the angels? Wherefore not to the prophets? For he might have found ten thousand other

testimonies.” But he desireth to show not this only that there are Two, but also that they are
of the same Substance.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Then said they unto Him, Who is thy father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know
Me, nor My Father.”</p>
<p>Because while they knew they spake as though they knew not, and as if trying Him, He
doth not even deem them worthy of an answer. Wherefore henceforth He speaketh all more
clearly and more boldly; drawing His testimony from signs, and from His teaching of them
that followed Him, and1459 by the Cross being near. For, “I know,” He saith, “whence I
come.” This would not greatly affect them, but the adding, “and whither I go,” would rather
terrify them, since He was not to remain in death. But why said He not, “I know that I am
God,” instead of, “I know whence I come”? He ever mingleth lowly words with sublime,
and even these He veileth. For after saying, “I bear witness of Myself,” and proving this, He
descendeth to a humbler strain. As though He had said, “I know from whom I am sent, and
to whom I depart.” For so they could have had nothing to say against it, when they heard
that He was sent from Him, and would depart to Him. “I could not have spoken,” He saith,
“any falsehood, I who am come from thence, and depart thither, to the true God. But ye
know not God, and therefore judge according to the flesh. For if having heard so many sure
signs and proofs ye still say, ‘thy witness is not true,’ if ye deem Moses worthy of credit, both
as to what he speaketh concerning others and what he speaketh concerning himself, but
Christ not so, this is to judge according to the flesh.” “But I judge no man.” He saith indeed
also that “the Father judgeth no man.” ( c. v. 22.) How then doth He here declare, that, “If
I judge, My judgment is just, for I am not alone”? He again speaketh in reply to their thoughts.
“The judgment which is Mine is the judgment of the Father. The Father, judging, would
not judge otherwise than as I do, and I should not judge otherwise than as the Father.”
Wherefore did He mention the Father? Because they would not have thought that the Son
was to be believed unless He received the witness of the Father. Besides, the saying doth not
even hold good. For in the case of men when two bear witness in a matter pertaining to
another, then their witness is true, (this is for two to witness,) but if one should witness for
himself, then they are no longer two. Seest thou that He said this for nothing else but to
show that He was of the same Substance, that He needed no other witness, and was in
nothing inferior to the Father? Observe at least His independence1460 ;</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “I am One that bear witness of Myself; and the Father that sent Me beareth
witness of Me.”</p>
<p>Had He been of inferior substance, He would not have put this. But now that thou
mayest not deem that the Father is included, to make up the number (of two), observe that
<note type="footnote">1459 Ben. omits “and.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1460 αὐθεντίαν</note>

<pb n="375"/>
His power hath nothing different (from the Father’s). A man bears witness when he is
trustworthy of himself, not when he himself needs testimony, and that too in a matter pertaining
to another; but in a matter of his own, where he needs the witness of another, he is
not trustworthy. But in this case it is all contrary. For He though bearing witness in a matter
of His own, and saying that witness is borne to Him by another, asserteth that He is trustworthy,
in every way manifesting His independence. For why, when He had said, “I am not
alone, but I and the Father that sent Me,” and, “The testimony of two men is true,” did He
not hold His peace, instead of adding, “I am One that bear witness of Myself”? It was evidently
to show His independence. And He placeth Himself first; “I am One that bear witness of
Myself.” Here He showeth His equality of honor, and that they were profited nothing by
saying that they knew God the Father, while they knew not Him. And He saith that the
cause of this (ignorance) was that they were not willing to know Him. Therefore He telleth
them that it was not possible to know the Father without knowing Him, that even so He
might draw them to the knowledge of Him. For since leaving Him they even sought to get
the knowledge of the Father, He saith, “Ye cannot know the Father without Me.” ( Ver. 19.)
So that they who blaspheme the Son, blaspheme not the Son only, but Him that begat Him
also.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> This let us avoid, and glorify the Son. Had He not been of the same Nature, He
would not have spoken thus. For had He merely taught, but been of different Substance, a
man might not have known Him, and yet have known the Father; and again, it would not
have been that one who knew Him, would have altogether known the Father; for neither
doth one who knoweth a man know an Angel. “Yes,” replieth some one, “he that knoweth
the creation, knoweth God.” By no means. Many, or rather I should say, all men know the
creation, (for they see it,) but they know not God. Let us then glorify the Son of God, not
with this glory (of words) only, but that also which is by works. For the first without the last
is nothing. “Behold,” saith St. Paul, “thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and makest
thy boast of God—thou therefore that teachest another, teachest1461 thou not thyself? Thou
that makest thy boast of the Law, through breaking of the Law dishonorest thou God?” (
Rom. ii. 17, 21, 23.) Beware lest we also who make boast of the rightness of our faith dishonor
God by not manifesting a life agreeable to the faith, causing Him to be blasphemed. For He
would have the Christian to be the teacher of the world, its leaven, its salt, its light. And
what is that light? It is a life which shineth, and hath in it no dark thing. Light is not useful
to itself, nor leaven, nor salt, but showeth its usefulness towards others, and so we are required
to do good, not to ourselves only, but to others. For salt, if it salt not, is not salt. Moreover
another thing is evident, that if we be righteous, others shall certainly be so also; but as long
as we are not righteous, we shall not be able to assist others. Let there be nothing foolish or
<note type="footnote">1461 Sav. “judgest.”</note>

<pb n="376"/>
silly among us; such are worldly matters, such are the cares of this life. Wherefore the virgins
were called foolish, because they were busy about foolish, worldly matters, gathering things
together here, but laying not up treasure where they ought. Fear there is lest this be our case,
fear lest we too depart clothed with filthy garments, to that place where all have them bright
and shining. For nothing is more filthy, nothing more impure, than sin. Wherefore the
Prophet declaring its nature cried out, “My wounds stink, and are corrupt.” ( Ps. xxxviii. 5.)
And if thou wilt fully learn how ill-savored sin is, consider it after it hath been done; when
thou art delivered from the desire, when the fire no longer troubleth thee, then shalt thou
see what sin is. Consider anger, when thou art calm; consider avarice, when thou dost not
feel it. There is nothing more shameful, nothing more accursed, than rapine and avarice.
This we continually say, desiring not to vex you, but to gain some great and wonderful advantage.
For he who hath not acted rightly after hearing once, may perhaps do so after
hearing a second time; and he who hath passed by the second time, may do right after the
third. God grant that we, being delivered from all evil things, may have the sweet savor of
Christ; for to Him, with the Father and the Holy Ghost is glory, now and ever and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John viii. 20</p>
<p>“These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as He taught in the Temple; and no man laid hands
on Him, for His hour was not yet come.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Oh the folly of the Jews! seeking Him as they did before the Passover, and then
having found Him in the midst of them, and having often attempted to take Him by their
own or by others’ hands without being able; they were not even so awed by His power, but
set themselves to their wickedness, and desisted not. For it saith, that they continually made
the attempt; “These words spake He in the treasury, teaching in the Temple; and no man
laid hands on Him.” He spake in the Temple, and in the character of teacher, which was
more adapted to rouse them, and He spake those things because of which they were stung,
and charged Him with making Himself equal to the Father. For “the witness of two men is
true,” proveth this. Yet still “He spake these words,” It saith, “in the Temple,” in the character
of teacher, “and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come”; that is, it was
not yet the fitting time at which He would be crucified. So that even then1462 the deed done
was not of their power, but of His dispensation, for they had long desired, but had not been
able, nor would they even then have been able, except He had consented.</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “Then said Jesus unto them, I go My way, and ye shall seek Me.”</p>
<p>Why saith He this continually? To shame and terrify their souls; for observe what fear
this saying caused in them. Although they desired to kill Him that they might be rid of Him,
they yet ask, “whither He goeth,” such great things did they imagine from the matter. He
desired also to show them another thing, that the deed would not be effected through their
force; but He showed it to them in a figure beforehand, and already foretold the Resurrection
by these words.</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?”</p>
<p>What then doth Christ? To remove their suspicion, and to show that such an act is sin,
He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “Ye are from beneath.”</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind: “It is no wonder that ye imagine such things, ye who are
carnal men, and have no spiritual thoughts, but I shall not do anything of the kind, for,</p>
<p>“I am from above; ye are of the world.”</p>
<p>Here again He speaketh of their worldly and carnal imaginations, whence it is clear that
the, “I am not of this world,” doth not mean that He had not taken upon Him flesh, but that
He was far removed from their wickedness. For He even saith, that His disciples were “not
<note type="footnote">1462 i.e. at the Crucifixion.</note>

<pb n="378"/>
of the world” ( c. xv. 19 ), yet they had flesh. As then Paul, when he saith, “Ye are not in the
flesh” ( Rom. viii. 9 ), doth not mean that they are incorporeal, so Christ when He saith,
that His disciples are “not of the world,” doth nothing else than testify to their heavenly
wisdom.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “I said therefore unto you that…if ye believe not that I am He, ye shall die in
your sins.”</p>
<p>For if He came to take away the sin of the world, and if it is impossible for men to put
that off in any other way except by the washing, it needs must be that he that believeth not
must depart hence, having1463 the old man; since he that will not by faith slay and bury that
old man, shall die in him, and shall go away to that place to suffer the punishment of His
former sins. Wherefore He said, “He that believeth not is judged already” ( c. iii. 18 ); not
merely through his not believing, but because he de parteth parteth hence having his former
sins upon him.</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “Then said they unto Him, Who art thou?”</p>
<p>Oh folly! After so long a time, such signs and teaching, they ask, “Who art thou?” What
then saith Christ?</p>
<p>“The same that I told you from the beginning.”</p>
<p>What He saith, is of this kind; “Ye are not worthy to hear My words at all, much less to
learn who I am, for ye say all that ye do, tempting Me, and giving heed to none of My sayings.
And all this I could now prove against you.” For this is the sense of,</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “I have many things to say and to judge of you.”</p>
<p>“I could not only prove you guilty, but also punish you; but He that sent Me, that is, the
Father, willeth not this. For I am come not to judge the world, but to save the world, since
God sent not His Son to judge the world, He saith, but to save the world. ( c. iii. 17.) If now
He hath sent Me for this, and He is true, with good cause I judge no one now. But these
things I speak that are for your salvation, not what are for your condemnation.” He speaketh
thus, lest they should deem that it was through weakness that on hearing so much from
them He went not to extremities, or that He knew not their secret thoughts and scoffings.</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “They understood not that He spake to them of the Father.”</p>
<p>Oh folly! He ceased not to speak concerning Him, and they knew Him not. Then when
after working many signs, and teaching them, He drew them not to Himself, He next
speaketh to them of the Cross, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 28, 29. “When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then ye shall know that I Am, and
that I speak not1464 of Myself, and that He that sent Me is with Me. And the Father hath
not left Me alone.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1463 al. “must have.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1464 “do nothing,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="379"/>
<p><del>2.</del> He showeth that He rightly said, “the same that I said unto you from the beginning.”
So little heed they gave to His words. “When ye have lifted up the Son of Man.” “Do ye not
expect that ye then shall certainly rid yourselves of Me, and slay Me? But I tell you that then
ye shall most know that I Am, by reason of the miracles, the resurrection, and the destruction
(of Jerusalem).” For all these things were sufficient to manifest His power. He said not,
“Then ye shall know who I am”; for, “when ye shall see,” He saith, “that I suffer nothing
from death, then ye shall know that I Am, that is, the Christ, the Son of God, who govern1465
all things, and am not opposed to Him.”1466 For which cause He addeth, “and of Myself I
speak nothing.” For ye shall know both My power and My unanimity with the Father. Because
the, “of Myself I speak nothing,” showeth that His Substance differeth not (from that of the
Father), and that He uttereth nothing save that which is in the mind of the Father. “For
when ye have been driven away from your place of worship, and it is not allowed you even
to serve Him as hitherto, then ye shall know that He doth this to avenge Me, and because
He is wroth with those who would not hear Me.” As though He had said, “Had I been an
enemy and a stranger to God, He would not have stirred up such wrath against you.” This
also Esaias declareth, “He shall give the wicked in return for His burial” ( Isa. liii. 9 , LXX.);
and David, “Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath” ( Ps. ii. 5 ); and Christ Himself,
“Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” ( Matt. xxiii. 38.) And His parables declare
the same thing when He saith, “What shall the Lord of that vineyard do to those husbandmen?
He shall miserably destroy those wicked men.” ( Matt. xxi. 40, 41.) Seest thou that
everywhere He speaketh thus, because He is not yet believed? But if He will destroy them,
as He will, (for, “Bring hither,” It saith, “those which would not that I should reign over
them, and slay them,”) wherefore saith He that the deed is not His, but His Father’s? He
addresseth Himself to their weakness, and at the same time honoreth Him that begat Him.
Wherefore He said not, “I leave your house desolate,” but, it “is left”; He hath put it impersonally.
But by saying, “How often would I have gathered your children together—and ye
would not,” and then adding, “is left,” He showeth that He wrought the desolation. “For
since,” He telleth them, “when ye were benefited and healed of your infirmities, ye would
not know Me, ye shall know by being punished who I am.”</p>
<p>“And the Father is with Me.” That they may not deem the “who sent Me” to be a mark
of inferiority, He saith, “is with Me”; the first belongeth to the Dispensation, the second to
the Godhead.</p>
<p>“And He hath not left Me alone,” for I do always those things that please Him.</p>
<p>Again He hath brought down His discourse to a humbler strain, continually setting
Himself against that which they asserted, that He was not of God, and that He kept not the
<note type="footnote">1465 φέρων καὶ ἄγων</note>
<note type="footnote">1466 i.e. to The Father.</note>

<pb n="380"/>
Sabbath. To this He replieth, “I do always those things that are pleasing unto Him”; showing
that it was pleasing unto Him even that the Sabbath should be broken. So, for instance, just
before the Crucifixion He said, “Think ye that I cannot call upon My Father?” ( Matt. xxvi.
53.) And yet by merely saying, “Whom seek ye?” ( c. xviii. 4, 6 ) He cast them down backwards.
Why then saith He not, “Think ye that I cannot destroy you,” when He had proved
this by deed? He condescendeth to their infirmity. For He took great pains to show that He
did nothing contrary to the Father. Thus He speaketh rather after the manner of a man; and
as “He hath not left Me alone,” was spoken, so also was the, “I do always those things that
are pleasing unto Him.”</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “As He spake these words, many believed on Him.”</p>
<p>When He brought down His speech to a lowly strain, many believed on Him. Dost thou
still ask wherefore He speaketh humbly? Yet the Evangelist clearly alluded to this when he
said, “As He spake these things, many believed on Him.” By this all but proclaiming aloud
to us, “Oh hearer, be not confounded if thou hear any lowly expression, for they who after
such high teaching were not yet persuaded that He was of the Father, were with good reason
made to hear humbler words, that they might believe.” And this is an excuse for those things
which shall be spoken in a humble way. They believed then, yet not as they ought, but
carelessly and as it were by chance, being pleased and refreshed by the humility of the words.
For that they had not perfect faith the Evangelist shows by their speeches after this, in which
they insult Him again. And that these are the very same persons he has declared by saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on Him, If ye continue in My
word.”</p>
<p>Showing that they had not yet received His doctrine, but only gave heed unto His words.
Wherefore He speaketh more sharply. Before He merely said, “Ye shall seek Me” ( c. vii. 34
), but now He addeth what is more, “Ye shall die in your sins.” ( c. viii. 21.) And He showeth
how; “because ye cannot when ye are come to that place afterwards entreat Me.”</p>
<p>“These things which I speak unto the world.”1467 By these words He showed that He
was now going forth to the Gentiles. But because they still knew not that He spake to them
of the Father, He again speaketh of Him, and the Evangelist hath put the reason of the humility
of the expressions.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> If now we will thus search the Scriptures, exactly and not carelessly, we shall be able
to attain unto our salvation; if we continually dwell upon them, we shall learn right doctrine
and a perfect life. For although a man be very hard, and stubborn, and proud, and profit
nothing at other times, yet at least he shall gain fruit from this time, and receive benefit, if
not so great as to admit of his being sensible of it, still he shall receive it. For if a man who

passes by an ointment-maker’s shop, or sitteth in one, is impregnated with the perfume
even against his will, much more is this the case with one who cometh to church. For as
idleness is born of idleness, so too from working is generated a ready mind. Although thou
art full of ten thousand sins, although thou art impure, shun not the tarrying here.
“Wherefore,” it may be said, “when hearing I do not?” It is no small profit to deem one’s
self wretched; this fear is not useless, this dread is not unseasonable. If only thou groanest
that, “hearing I do not,” thou wilt certainly come also to the doing at some time or other.
For it cannot be that he who speaks with God, and hears God speak, should not profit. We
compose ourselves at once and wash our hands when we desire to take the Bible into them.
Seest thou even before the reading what reverence is here? And if we go on with exactness,
we shall reap great advantage. For we should not, unless it served to place the soul in reverence,
have washed our hands; and a woman if she be unveiled straightway puts on her veil,
giving proof of internal reverence, and a man if he be covered bares his head. Seest thou
how the outward behavior proclaims the inward reverence? Then moreover he that sits to
hear groans often, and condemns his present life.</p>
<p>Let us then, beloved, give heed to the Scriptures, and if no other part be so, let the Gospels
at least be the subjects of our earnest care, let us keep them in our hands. For straightway
when thou hast opened the Book thou shalt see the name of Christ there, and shalt hear one
say, “The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. When His mother Mary was espoused to
Joseph, she was found with Child of the Holy Ghost.” ( Matt. i. 18.) He that heareth this will
immediately desire virginity, will marvel at the Birth, will be freed from earthly things. It is
not a little thing when thou seest the Virgin deemed worthy of the Spirit, and an Angel
talking with her. And this upon the very surface; but if thou perseverest to go on unto the
end, thou shalt loathe all that pertains to this life, shalt mock at all worldly things. If thou
art rich, thou shalt think nothing of wealth, when thou hearest that she who was (the wife)
of a carpenter, and of humble family, became the mother of thy Lord. If thou art poor thou
shalt not be ashamed of thy poverty, when thou hearest that the Creator of the world was
not ashamed of the meanest dwelling. Considering this, thou wilt not rob, thou wilt not
covet, thou wilt not take the goods of others, but wilt rather be a lover of poverty, and despise
wealth. And if this be the case, thou shalt banish all evil. Again, when thou seest Him lying
in a manger, thou wilt not be anxious to put golden garments about thy child, or to cause
thy wife’s couch to be inlaid with silver. And if thou carest not for these things, thou wilt
not do either the deeds of covetousness and rapine, which are caused by them. Many other
things you may gain which I cannot separately enumerate, but they will know who have
made the trial. Wherefore I exhort you both to obtain Bibles, and to retain together with
the Bibles the sentiments they set forth, and to write them in your minds. The Jews because
they gave no heed were commanded to suspend their books from their hands;1468 but we

place them not even in our hands but in our house, when we ought to stamp them on our
heart. Thus cleansing our present life, we shall obtain the good things that are to come to
which may we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John viii. 31, 32</p>
<p>“Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on Him, If ye continue in My word, then are ye
My disciples indeed. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Beloved, our condition needs much endurance; and endurance is produced when
doctrines are deeply rooted. For as no wind is able by its assaults to tear up the oak, which
sends down its root into the lower recesses of the earth, and is firmly clenched there; so too
the soul which is nailed by the fear of God none will be able to overturn. Since to be nailed
is more than to be rooted. Thus the Prophet prayeth, saying, “Nail my flesh by Thy fear” (
Ps. cxix. 120 , LXX.); “do Thou so fix and join me, as by a nail riveted into me.” For as men
of this kind are hard to be captured, so the opposite sort are a ready prey, and are easily
thrown down. As was the case of the Jews at that time; for after having heard and believed,
they again turned out of the way. Christ therefore desiring to deepen their faith that it might
not be merely superficial, diggeth into their souls by more striking words. For it was the
part of believers to endure even reproofs, but they immediately were wroth. But how doth
He this? He first telleth them, “If ye continue in My word, ye are My disciples indeed: and
the truth shall make you free.” All but saying, “I am about to make a deep incision, but be
not ye moved”; or rather by these expressions He allayed the pride of their imagination.
“Shall make you free”: from what, tell me? From your sins. What then say those boasters?</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man.”</p>
<p>Immediately their imagination dropped, and this happened from their having been
fluttered1469 about worldly things. “If ye continue in My word,” was the expression of One
declaring what was in their heart, and knowing that they had indeed believed, but had not
continued. And He promiseth a great thing, that they should become His disciples. For since
some had gone away from Him before this, alluding to them He saith, “If ye continue,” because
they also had heard and believed, and departed because they could not continue. “For
many of His disciples went back, and walked no more openly with Him.”1470 ( c. vi. 66.)</p>
<p>“Ye shall know the truth,” that is, “shall know Me, for I am the truth. All the Jewish
matters were types, but ye shall know the truth from Me, and it shall free you from your
sins.” As to those others He said, “Ye shall die in your sins,” so to these He saith, “shall make
you free.” He said not, “I will deliver you from bondage,” this He allowed them to conjecture.
What then said they?</p>
<note type="footnote">1469 ἐ πτοῆσθαι</note>
<note type="footnote">1470 some omit “openly.”</note>

<pb n="384"/>
<p>“We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man.” And yet if they must
needs have been vexed, it might have been expected that they would have been so at the
former part of His speech, at His having said, “Ye shall know the truth”; and that they would
have replied, “What! do we not now know the truth? Is then the Law and our knowledge a
lie?” But they cared for none of these things, they are grieved at worldly things, and these
were their notions of bondage. And certainly even now, there are many who feel shame at
indifferent matters, and at this kind of bondage, but who feel none for the bondage of sin,
and who would rather be called servants to this latter kind of bondage ten thousand times,
than once to the former. Such were these men, and they did not even know of any other
bondage, and they say, “Bondsmen callest thou those who are of the race of Abraham, the
nobly born, who therefore ought not to be called bondsmen? For, saith one, we were never
in bondage to any man.” Such are the boastings of the Jews. “We are the seed of Abraham,”
“we are Israelites.” They never mention their own righteous deeds. Wherefore John cried
out to them, saying, “Think not to say that we have Abraham to our father.” ( Matt. iii. 9.)
And why did not Christ confute them, for they had often been in bondage to the Egyptians,
Babylonians, and many others? Because His words were not to gain honor for Himself, but
for their salvation, for their benefit, and toward this object He was pressing. For He might
have spoken of the four hundred years, He might have spoken of the seventy, He might
have spoken of the years of bondage during the time of the Judges, at one time twenty, at
another two, at another seven; He might have said that they had never ceased being in
bondage. But He desired not to show that they were slaves of men, but that they were slaves
of sin, which is the most grievous slavery, from which God alone can deliver; for to forgive
sins belongeth to none other. And this too they allowed. Since then they confessed that this
was the work of God, He bringeth them to this point, and saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.”</p>
<p>Showing that this is the freedom of which He speaketh, the freedom from this service.</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “The servant abideth not in the house, but the Son abideth forever.”</p>
<p>Gently too from this He casts down the things of the Law,1471 alluding to former times.
For that they may not run back to them and say, “We have the sacrifices which Moses
commanded, they are able to deliver us,” He addeth these words, since otherwise what
connection would the saying have? For “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God,
being justified freely by His grace” ( Rom. iii. 23, 24 ), even the priests themselves. Wherefore
Paul also saith of the priest, that “he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for
sins, for that he also is compassed about with infirmity.” ( Heb. v. 3, 2.) And this is signified
by His saying, “The servant abideth not in the house.” Here also He showeth His equal
<note type="footnote">1471 Sav. “Gently and by help of the Law He casts them down.”</note>

<pb n="385"/>
honor with the Father, and the difference between slave and free. For the parable has this
meaning, that is, “the servant hath no power,” this is the meaning of “abideth not.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> But why when speaking of sins doth He mention a “house”? It is to show that as a
master hath power over his house, so He over all. And the, “abideth not,” is this,“hath not
power to grant favors, as not being master of the house”; but the Son is master of the house.
For this is the, “abideth forever,” by a metaphor drawn from human things. That they may
not say, “who art thou?” “All is Mine, (He saith,) for I am the Son, and dwell in My Father’s
house,” calling by the name of “house” His power. As in another place He calleth the Kingdom
His Father’s house, “In My Father’s house are many mansions.” ( c. xiv. 2.) For since
the discourse was of freedom and bondage, He with reason used this metaphor, telling them
that they had no power to set free.1472</p>
<p>Ver. 36. “If the Son therefore shall make you free.”</p>
<p>Seest thou the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and how He declareth that
He hath the same power as the Father? “If the Son make you free, no man afterwards gainsayeth,
but ye have firm freedom.” For “it is God that justifieth, who is He that condemneth?”
( Rom. viii. 33, 34.) Here He showeth that He Himself is pure from sin, and alludeth to that
freedom which reached only to a name; this even men give, but that God alone. And so he
persuaded them not to be ashamed at this slavery, but at that of sin. And desiring to show
that they were not slaves, except by repudiating that liberty, He the more showeth them to
be slaves by saying,1473</p>
<p>“Ye shall be free indeed.”</p>
<p>This is the expression of one declaring that this freedom was not real. Then, that they
might not say, “We have no sin,” (for it was probable that they would say so,) observe how
He bringeth them beneath this imputation. For omitting to convict all their life, He bringeth
forward that which they had in hand, which they yet desired to do, and saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed but ye seek to kill Me.”</p>
<p>Gently and by little doth He expel them from that relationship, teaching them not to
be high-minded because of it. For as freedom and bondage depend on men’s actions, so
also doth relationship. He said not directly, “Ye are not the seed of Abraham, ye the murderers
of the righteous”; but for a while He even goeth along with them, and saith, “I know that ye
are Abraham’s seed.” Yet this is not the matter in question, and during the remainder of
<note type="footnote">1472 or, “forgive.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1473 This reading is from a Vatican ms. which has εἰ μὴ. Savile’s is not grammatical. Ben. reads, “Then desiring

<pb n="386"/>
this speech He useth greater vehemence. For we may for the most part observe, that when
He is about to work any great thing, after He hath wrought it, He useth greater boldness of
speech, as though the testimony from His works shut men’s mouths. “But ye seek to kill
Me.” “What of that,” saith some one, “if they sought to do so justly.” But this was not so
either; wherefore also He puts the reason;</p>
<p>“Because My word hath no place in you.”</p>
<p>“How then was it,” saith some one, “that they believed on Him?” As I before said, they
changed again. On which account He touched them sharply. “If ye boast the relationship
of Abraham ye ought also to show forth his life.” And He said not, “Ye do not contain1474
my words,” but, “My word hath no place in you,” thus declaring the sublimity of His doctrines.
Yet not for this ought they to have slain, but rather to have honored and waited on
Him so as to learn. “But what,” saith some one, “if thou speakest these things of thyself?”
On this account He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “I speak that which I have seen with My Father, and ye do that which ye have
heard from1475 your father.”</p>
<p>“As,” He saith, “I both by My words and by the truth declare the Father, so also do ye
by your actions (declare yours). For I have not only the same Substance, but also the same
Truth with the Father.”</p>
<p>Ver. 39, 40. “They said unto Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye
had Abraham to your father, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill
Me.”</p>
<p>He here repeatedly handleth their murderous intention, and maketh mention of Abraham.
And this He doth desiring to draw off their attention from this relationship, and to
take away their excessive boasting, and also to persuade them no longer to rest their hopes
of salvation in Abraham, nor in the relationship which is according to nature, but in that
which is according to the will.1476 For what hindered their coming to Christ was this, their
deeming that relationship to be sufficient for them to salvation. But what is the “truth” of
which He speaketh? That He is equal with the Father. For it was on this account that the
Jews sought to slay Him; and He saith,</p>
<p>“Ye seek to kill Me because I have1477 told you the truth, which I have heard of My
Father.”1478</p>

<p>To show that these things are not opposed to the Father, He again betaketh Himself to
Him. They say unto Him,</p>
<p>Ver. 41. “We be not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “What sayest thou? Ye have God for your Father, and do ye blame Christ for asserting
this?” Seest thou that He said that God was His Father in a special manner? When therefore
He had cast them out of their relationship to Abraham, having nothing to reply, they dare
a greater thing, and betake themselves to God. But from this honor also He expelleth them,
saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 42-44. “If God were your Father, ye would love Me; for I proceeded forth and came
from God; neither came I of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do ye not understand My speech?
Even because ye cannot hear My word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth:1479
when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.”</p>
<p>He had driven them out of their relationship to Abraham, and when they dared greater
things, He then addeth a blow, telling them that they not only are not Abraham’s children,
but that they are even children of the devil, and inflicting a wound which might counterbalance
their shamelessness; nor doth He leave it unsupported, but establisheth it by proofs.
“For,” He saith, “to murder1480 belongeth to the wickedness of the devil.” And He said not
merely, “ye do his works,” but, “ye do his lusts,” showing that both he and they hold to
murder,1481 and that envy was the cause. For the devil destroyed Adam, not because he had
any charge against him, but only from envy. To this also He alludeth here.</p>
<p>“And abode not in the truth.” That is, in the right life. For since they continually accused
Him of not being from God, He telleth them that this also is from thence.1482 For the devil
first was the father of a lie, when he said, “In the day that ye eat thereof your eyes shall be
opened” ( Gen. iii. 5 ), and he first used it. For men use a lie not as a thing proper, but alien
to their nature, but he as proper.</p>
<p>Ver. 45. “And because I tell you the truth, ye believe Me not.”</p>
<p>What kind of consequence is this? “Having no charge against Me, ye desire to kill Me.
For because ye are enemies of the truth, therefore ye persecute Me. Since had this not been
the reason, ye would have named your charge.” Wherefore He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 46. “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?”</p>
<note type="footnote">1479 “because there is no truth in him,” omitted.</note>
<note type="footnote">1480 al. “be murderously minded.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1481 al. “are murderously minded.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1482 i.e. that this assertion of theirs being false is from the devil.</note>

<pb n="388"/>
<p>Then they said, “We be not born of fornication.” Yet in fact many of them were born
of fornication, for they practiced unbefitting unions. Still He doth not convict them of this,
but setteth Himself to the other point. For when He hath proved them to be, not of God,
but of the devil, by all these signs, (for to do murder is of the devil, and to lie is of the devil,
both which ye do,) then He showeth that to love is the sign of being of God. “Why do ye
not understand My speech?” Since they were always doubting, saying, “What is it that he
saith, ‘Whither I go ye cannot come’?” therefore He telleth them, “Ye do not understand
My speech,” “because ye have not the word of God. And this cometh to you, because that
your understanding is groveling, and because what is Mine is far too great for you.” But
what if they could not understand? Not to be able here means not to be willing; for “ye have
trained yourselves to be mean, to imagine nothing great.” Because they said that they persecuted
Him as being themselves zealous for God, on this account He everywhere striveth to
show that to persecute Him is the act of those who hate God, but that, on the contrary, to
love Him is the act of those who know God.</p>
<p>“We have one Father, even God.” On this ground they pride themselves, on their honor
not their righteous deeds. “Therefore your not believing is no proof that I am an enemy to
God, but your unbelief is a sign that you do not know God. And the reason is, from your
being willing to lie and to do the works of the devil. But this is the effect of meanness of
soul; (as the Apostle saith, ‘For whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not
carnal?’) ( 1 Cor. iii. 3.) And why is it that ye cannot1483 ? Because ye will to do the lusts of
your father, ye are eager, ye are ambitious (to do them).” Seest thou that “ye cannot” express
a want of will? For “this did not Abraham.” “What are his works? Gentleness, meekness,
obedience. But ye set yourselves on the contrary part, being hard and cruel.”</p>
<p>But how came it into their thoughts to betake themselves to God? He had shown them
unworthy of Abraham; desiring therefore to escape this charge, they mounted higher. For
when He reproached them with murder, they said this,1484 making it, as it were, a kind of
excuse for themselves that they were avenging God. Therefore He showeth that this very
thing is the act of men opposing God. And the, “I came forth,” showeth that He was from
thence.1485 He saith, “I came forth,” alluding to His arrival among us. But since they would
probably say to Him, “Thou speaketh certain things strange and new,1486” He telleth them
that He was come from God. “And therefore with good reason ye hear them not, because
ye are of the devil. For on what account would ye kill Me? What charge have ye to bring
against Me? If there be none, why do ye not believe Me?” Thus then having proved them to
<note type="footnote">1483 i.e. cannot understand.</note>
<note type="footnote">1484 i.e. that God was their Father.</note>
<note type="footnote">1485 i.e. “from God.”</note>

<pb n="389"/>
be of the devil by their lying and their murder, He showeth them also to be alien from Abraham
and from God, both because they hated One who had done no wrong, and because
they would not hear His word; and in every way He proveth that He was not opposed to
God, and that it was not on this account that they refused to believe, but because they were
aliens from God. For when One who had done no sin, who said that He came from God
and was sent of God, who spake the truth, and so spake it as to challenge all to the proof,
after this was not believed, it is clear that He was not believed because of their being carnal.
Since sins do use, yea they do use to debase a soul. Wherefore It saith, “Seeing ye are become
dull of hearing.” ( Heb. v. 11.) For when a man cannot despise earthly things, how shall he
ever be wise concerning heavenly things?</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Wherefore, I exhort you, use we every means that our life may be righteous, that
our minds may be cleansed, so that no filthiness be a hindrance to us; kindle for yourselves
the light of knowledge, and sow not among thorns. For how shall one who knows not that
covetousness is an evil, ever know the greater good? how shall one who refrains not from
these earthly things ever hold fast to those heavenly? It is good to take by violence, not the
things that perish, but the Kingdom of heaven. “The violent,” it saith, “take it by force.” (
Matt. xi. 12.) It is then not possible to attain to it by sluggishness, but by zeal. But what
meaneth “the violent”? There is need of much violence, (for strait is the way,) there is need
of a youthful soul and a noble. Plunderers desire to outstrip all other, they look to nothing,
neither to conviction, nor accusation, nor punishment, but are given up to one thing only,
the getting hold of what they desire to seize, and they run past all that are before them in
the way. Seize we then the Kingdom of heaven, for here to seize is no fault but rather praise,
and the fault is the not seizing. Here our wealth comes not from another’s loss. Haste we
then to seize it. Should passion disquiet us, should lust disquiet us, let us do violence to our
nature, let us become more gentle, let us labor a little, that we may rest forever. Seize not
thou gold, but seize that wealth which showeth gold to be but mud. For tell me, if lead and
gold were laid before thee, which wouldest thou take? Is it not clear that thou wouldest take
the gold? Dost thou then, where one who seizes is punished, prefer that which is the more
valuable, but where one who seizes is honored, give up what is the more valuable? If there
were punishment in both cases, wouldest thou not rather aim at this latter1487 ? But in this
case there is nothing like punishment, but even blessedness. And, “How,” saith some one,
“may one seize it?” Cast away the things which thou hast already in thy hands; for so long
as thou graspest them1488 thou wilt not be able to seize the other. For consider, I pray you,
a man with his hands full of silver, will he be able, as long as he retains it, to seize on gold,
unless he first cast away the silver, and be free? Because he that seizes a thing must be well-

girt so as not to be detained. And even now there are adverse powers running down against
us to rob us, but let us fly them, let us fly them, trailing after us nothing that may give a hold,
let us cut asunder the cords, let us strip ourselves of the things of earth. What need of silken
garments? How long shall we be unrolling this mockery? How long shall we be burying
gold? I desired to cease from always saying these things, but ye will not suffer me, continually
supplying me with occasions and arguments. But now at least let us desist, that having instructed
others by our lives, we may obtain the promised good things, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom to the Father and
the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John viii. 48, 49</p>
<p>“Then answered the Jews, and said unto Him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and
hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor My Father.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A shameless and a forward1489 thing is wickedness, and when it ought to hide itself,
then is it the fiercer. As was the case with the Jews. For when they ought to have been pricked
by what was said, admiring the boldness and conclusiveness1490 of the words, they even
insult Him, calling Him a Samaritan, and saying that He had a devil, and they ask, “Said we
not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?” Because when He uttereth anything
sublime, this is thought among the very senseless to be madness. Yet nowhere before did
the Evangelist say that they called Him “a Samaritan”; but from this expression it is probable
that this had been often asserted by them.</p>
<p>“Thou hast a devil,” saith some one. Who is it that hath a devil? He that honoreth God,
or he that insulteth Him that honoreth Him? What then saith Christ, who is very meekness
and gentleness? “I have not a devil, but I honor Him1491 that sent me.” Where there was
need to instruct them, to pull down their excessive insolence, to teach them not to be proud
because of Abraham, He was vehement; but when it was needful that He being insulted
should bear it, He used much gentleness. When they said, “We have God and Abraham for
our Father,” He touched them sharply; but when they called Him a demoniac, He spake
submissively, thus teaching us to avenge insults offered to God, but to overlook such as are
offered to ourselves.</p>
<p>Ver. 50. “I seek not Mine own glory.”</p>
<p>“These things,” He saith, “I have spoken to show that it becometh not you, being murderers,
to call God your Father; so that I have spoken them through honor for Him, and for
His sake do I hear these reproaches, and for His sake do ye dishonor Me. Yet I care not for
this insolence1492 ; to Him, for whose sake I now hear these things, ye owe an account of
your words. For ‘I seek not Mine own glory.’ Wherefore I omit to punish you, and betake
Myself to exhortation, and counsel you so to act, that ye shall not only escape punishment,
but also attain eternal life.”</p>
<p>Ver. 51. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death.”</p>

<p>Here He speaketh not of faith only, but of a pure life. Above He said, “shall have everlasting
life,” but here, “shall not see death.” ( c. vi. 40.) At the same time He hinteth to them
that they could do nothing against Him, for if the man that should keep His saying should
not die, much less should He Himself. At least they understood it so, and said to Him,</p>
<p>Ver. 52. “Now we know that thou hast a devil; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are
dead.”</p>
<p>That is, “they who heard the word of God are dead, and shall they who have heard thine
not die?”</p>
<p>Ver. 53. “Art thou greater than our father Abraham?”</p>
<p>Alas for their vainglory! Again do they betake themselves to his relationship. Yet it
would have been suitable to say, “Art thou greater than God? or they who have heard thee
than Abraham?” But they say not this, because they thought that He was even less than
Abraham. At first, therefore, He showed that they were murderers, and so led them away
from the relationship; but when they persevered, He contrived this in another way, showing
that they labored uselessly. And concerning the “death,” He said nothing to them, neither
did He reveal or tell them what kind of death He meant, but in the meantime He would
have them believe, that He is greater than Abraham, that even by this He may put them to
shame. “Certainly,” He saith, “were I a common man I ought not to die, having done no
wrong; but when I speak the truth, and have no sin, am sent from God, and am greater than
Abraham, are ye not mad, do ye not labor in vain when ye attempt to kill Me?” What then
is their reply? “Now we know that thou hast a devil.” Not so spake the woman of Samaria.
She said not to Him, “Thou hast a devil”; but only, “Art thou greater than our father Jacob?”
( c. iv. 12.) For these men were insolent and accursed, while she desired to learn; wherefore
she doubted and answered with proper moderation, and called Him, “Lord.” For one who
promised far greater things, and who was worthy of credit, ought not to have been insulted,
but even admired; yet these men said that He had a devil. Those expressions of the Samaritan
woman were those of one in doubt; these were the words of men unbelieving and perverse.
“Art thou greater than our father Abraham?” so that this (which He had said) maketh Him
to be greater than Abraham. “When therefore ye have seen Him lifted up,1493 ye shall confess
that He is greater.” On this account He said, “When ye have lifted Me1494 up, ye shall know
that I Am.” ( Ver. 28.) And observe His wisdom. Having first rent them away from Abraham’s
kindred, He showeth that He is greater than Abraham, that so He may be seen to be very
exceedingly greater than the Prophets also. Indeed it was because they continually called
Him a prophet that He said, “My word hath no place in you.” ( Ver. 37.) In that other
place1495 He declared that He raiseth the dead, but here He saith, “He that believeth shall

never see death,” which was a much greater thing than not to allow believers to be holden,
by death. Wherefore the Jews were the more enraged. What then say they?</p>
<p>“Whom makest thou thyself?”</p>
<p>And this too in an insulting manner. “Thou art taking somewhat upon thyself,” saith
one of them. To this then Christ replieth;</p>
<p>Ver. 54. “If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What say the heretics here? That He heard the question, “Art thou greater than our
father Abraham?” and dared not to say to them, “Yea, I am greater,” but did so in a covert
manner. What then? Is His honor “nothing”? With respect to them1496 it is nothing. And
as He said, “My witness is not true” ( c. v. 31 ), with reference to the opinion they would
form of it, so also doth He speak here.</p>
<p>“There is One1497 that honoreth Me.”</p>
<p>And wherefore said He not, “The Father that sent Me,” as He did before, but,
“Of whom ye say that He is your God.”</p>
<p>Ver. 55. “Yet ye have not known Him.” Because He desired to show that they not only
knew not His Father, but that they knew not God.</p>
<p>“But I know Him.”</p>
<p>“So that to say, ‘I know Him,’ is not a boast, while to say, ‘I know Him not,’ would be a
falsehood; but ye when ye say that ye know Him, lie; as then ye, when ye say that ye know
Him, lie, so also should I, were I to say that I know Him not.”</p>
<p>“If I honor Myself.” Since they said, “Whom makest thou thyself?” He replieth, “If I
make (Myself anything,) My honor is nothing. As then I know Him exactly, so ye know
Him not.” And as in the case of Abraham, He did not take away their whole assertion, but
said, “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed,” so as to make the charge against them heavier;
thus here He doth not remove the whole, but what? “Whom ye say.” 1498 By granting to
them their boast of words, He increaseth the force of the accusation against them. How then
do ye “not know Him”? “Because ye insult One who saith and doeth everything that He1499
may be glorified, even when that One is sent from Him.” This assertion is unsupported by
testimony, but what follows serves to establish it.</p>
<p>“And I keep His saying.”</p>
<p>Here they might, if at least they had anything to say, have refuted Him, for it was the
strongest proof of His having been sent by God.</p>
<p>Ver. 56. “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.”</p>

<p>Again, He showeth that they were aliens from the race of Abraham, if they grieved at
what he rejoiced in. “My day,” seems to me to mean the day of the Crucifixion, which Abraham
foreshowed typically by the offering of the ram and of Isaac. What do they reply?</p>
<p>Ver. 57. “Thou art not yet forty1500 years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?”</p>
<p>So that we conclude1501 that Christ was nearly forty.</p>
<p>Ver. 58, 59. “Jesus saith unto them, Before Abraham was, I Am. Then took they up
stones to cast at Him.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He proved Himself to be greater than Abraham? For the man who rejoiced
to see His day, and made this an object of earnest desire, plainly did so because it was
a day that should be for a benefit, and belonging to one greater than himself. Because they
had said, “The carpenter’s son” ( Matt. xiii. 55 ), and imagined nothing more concerning
Him, He leadeth them by degrees to an exalted notion of Him. Therefore when they heard
the words, “Ye know not God,” they were not grieved; but when they heard, “before Abraham
was, I Am,” as though the nobility of their descent were debased, they became furious, and
would have stoned Him.</p>
<p>“He saw My day, and was glad.” He showeth, that not unwillingly He came to His Passion,
since He praiseth him who was gladdened at the Cross. For this was the salvation of
the world. But they cast stones at Him; so ready were they for murder, and they did this of
their own accord, without enquiry.</p>
<p>But wherefore said He not, “Before Abraham was, I was,” instead of “I Am”? As the
Father useth this expression, “I Am,” so also doth Christ; for it signifieth continuous Being,
irrespective of all time. On which account the expression seemed to them to be blasphemous.
Now if they could not bear the comparison with Abraham, although this was but a trifling
one, had He continually made Himself equal to the Father, would they ever have ceased
casting stones at Him?</p>
<p>After this, again He fleeth as a man, and concealeth Himself, having laid before them
sufficient instruction: and having accomplished His work, He went forth from the Temple,
and departed to heal the blind, proving by His actions that He is before Abraham. But perhaps
some one will say, “Why did He not paralyze their strength?1502 So they would have believed.”
He healed the paralytic, yet they believed not; nay, He wrought ten thousand wonders; at
the very Passion He cast them to the ground, and darkened their eyes, yet they believed not;
and how would they have believed if He had paralyzed their strength? There is nothing
worse than a soul hardened in desperation; though it see signs and wonders, it still perseveres
in retaining the same shamelessness. Thus Pharaoh, who received ten thousand strokes, was

<note type="footnote">1502 i.e. so that they could not stone Him.</note>

<pb n="395"/>
sobered only while being punished, and continued of this character until the last day of his
life, pursuing those whom he had let go. Wherefore Paul continually saith, “Lest any of you
be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” ( Heb. iii. 13.) For as the callosities1503 of the body,
when formed, become dead, and possess no sensation; so the soul, when it is occupied by
many passions, becomes dead to virtue; and apply what you will to it, it gets no perception
of the matter, but whether you threaten punishment or anything else, continues insensible.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Wherefore I beseech you, while we have hopes of salvation, while we can turn, to
use every means to do so. For men who have become past feeling, are after that in the blind
state1504 of despairing pilots, who give up their vessel to the wind, and themselves contribute
no assistance. Thus the envious man looks to one thing only, that is, to satisfy his lust, and
though he be like to be punished or even slain, still he is possessed solely by that passion;
and in like manner the intemperate and avaricious. But if the sovereignty of the passions
be so great, much greater is that of virtue; if for them we despise death, much more for this;
if they (sinners) regard not their own lives, much less ought we to do so in the cause of our
salvation. For what shall we have to say, if when they who perish are so active about their
own perdition, we for our own salvation manifest not even an equal activity, but ever continue
wasting with envy? Nothing is worse than envy; to destroy another it destroys itself
also. The eye of the envious wastes away in grief, he lives in a continual death, he deems all
men, even those who have never wronged him, his enemies. He grieves that God is honored,
he rejoices in what the devil rejoices in. Is any honored among men? This is not honor, envy
him not. But is he honored by God? Strive and be thou like him. Thou wilt not? Why then
dost thou destroy thyself too? Why castest thou away what thou hast? Canst thou not be
like unto him, nor gain any good thing? Why then dost thou besides this take for thyself
evil, when thou oughtest to rejoice with him, that so even if thou be not able to share his
toils, thou mayest profit by rejoicing with Him? For often even the will is able to effect great
good. At least Ezekiel saith, that the Moabites were punished because they rejoiced over the
Israelites, and that certain others were saved because they mourned over the misfortunes
of their neighbors. ( Ezek. xxv. 8.) Now if there be any comfort for those who mourn over
the woes of others, much more for those who rejoice at the honors of others. He charged
the Moabites with having exulted over the Israelites, yet it was God that punished them;
but not even when He punisheth will He have us rejoice over those that are punished. For
it is not His wish to punish them. Now if we must condole with those who are punished,
much more must we avoid envying those who are honored. Thus, for example, Corah and

Dathan perished with their company, making those whom they envied brighter, and giving
themselves up to punishment. For a venomous beast is envy, an unclean beast, a deliberate
vice which admits not of pardon, a wickedness stripped of excuse, the cause and mother of
all evils. Wherefore let us pluck it up by the roots, that we may be freed from evil here, and
may obtain blessings hereafter; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory now and ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John ix. 1, 2</p>
<p>“And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth. And His disciples
asked Him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth.” Being full
of love for man, and caring for our salvation, and desiring to stop the mouths of the foolish,
He omitteth nothing of His own part, though there be none to give heed. And the Prophet
knowing this saith, “That Thou mightest be justified when Thou speakest, and be clear when
Thou art judged.” ( Ps. li. 4.) Wherefore here, when they would not receive His sublime
sayings, but said that He had a devil, and attempted to kill Him, He went forth from the
Temple, and healed the blind, mitigating their rage by His absence, and by working the
miracle softening their hardness and cruelty, and establishing His assertions. And He worketh
a miracle which was no common one, but one which took place then for the first time. “Since
the world began,” saith he who was healed, “was it not heard that any man opened the eyes
of one that was born blind.” ( Ver. 32.) Some have, perhaps, opened the eyes of the blind,
but of one born blind never. And that on going out of the Temple, He proceeded intentionally
to the work, is clear from this; it was He who saw the blind man, not the blind man who
came to Him; and so earnestly did He look upon him, that even His disciples perceived it.
From this, at least, they came to question Him; for when they saw Him earnestly regarding
the man, they asked Him, saying, “Who did sin, this man, or his parents?” A mistaken
question, for how could he sin before he was born? and how, if his parents had sinned, would
he have been punished? Whence then came they to put this question? Before, when He
healed the paralytic, He said, “Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more.” ( c. v. 14.) They
therefore, having understood that he was palsied on account of sin, said, “Well, that other
was palsied because of his sins; but concerning this man, what wouldest Thou say? hath he
sinned? It is not possible to say so, for he is blind from his birth. Have his parents sinned?
Neither can one say this, for the child suffers not punishment for the father.” As therefore
when we see a child evil entreated, we exclaim, “What can one say of this? what has the child
done?” not as asking a question, but as being perplexed, so the disciples spake here, not so
much asking for information, as being in perplexity. What then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents.”</p>
<p>This He saith not as acquitting them of sins, for He saith not simply, “Neither hath this
man sinned, nor his parents,” but addeth, “that he should have been born blind1505 —but
that the Son of God should be glorified in him.” “For both this man hath sinned and his
<note type="footnote">1505 not in N.T.</note>

<pb n="398"/>
parents, but his blindness proceedeth not from that.” And this He said, not signifying that
though this man indeed was not in such case, yet that others had been made blind from
such a cause, the sins of their parents, since it cannot be that when one sinneth another
should be punished. For if we allow this, we must also allow that he sinned before his birth.
As therefore when He declared, “neither hath this man sinned,” He said not that it is possible
to sin from one’s very birth, and be punished for it; so when He said, “nor his parents,” He
said not that one may be punished for his parents’ sake. This supposition He re moveth by
the mouth of Ezekiel; “As I live saith the Lord, this proverb shall not be, that is used, The
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” ( Ezek. xviii. 3, 2.)
And Moses saith, “The father shall not die for the child, neither shall the child die for the
father.” ( Deut. xxiv. 16.) And of a certain king1506 Scripture saith, that for this very reason
he did not this thing,1507 observing the law of Moses. But if any one argue, “How then is it
said, ‘Who visiteth the sins of the parents upon the children unto the third and fourth generation’?”
( Deut. v. 9 ); we should make this answer, that the assertion is not universal, but
that it is spoken with reference to certain who came out of Egypt. And its meaning is of this
kind; “Since these who have come out of Egypt, after signs and wonders, have become worse
than their forefathers who saw none of these things, they shall suffer,” It saith, “the same
that those others suffered, since they have dared the same crimes.” And that it was spoken
of those men, any one who will give attention to the passage will more certainly know.
Wherefore then was he born blind?</p>
<p>“That the glory1508 of God should be made manifest,”1509 He saith.</p>
<p>Lo, here again is another difficulty, if without this man’s punishment, it was not possible
that the glory of God should be shown. Certainly it is not said that it was impossible, for it
was possible, but, “that it might be manifested even in this man.” “What,” saith some one,
“did he suffer wrong for the glory of God?” What wrong, tell me? For what if God had
never willed to produce him at all? But I assert that he even received benefit from his
blindness: since he recovered the sight of the eyes within. What were the Jews profited by
their eyes? They incurred the heavier punishment, being blinded even while they saw. And
what injury had this man by his blindness? For by means of it he recovered sight. As then
the evils of the present life are not evils, so neither are the good things good; sin alone is an
evil, but blindness is not an evil. And He who had brought this man from not being into
being, had also power to leave him as he was.</p>

<p><del>2.</del> But some say, that this conjunction1510 is not at all expressive of cause, but relates
to the consequence of the miracle; as when He saith, “For judgment I am come into this
world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind” (
ver. 39 ); and yet it was not for this He came, that those who saw might be made blind. And
again Paul, “Because that which may be known of God is manifested in them, that they may
be without excuse” ( Rom. i. 19, 20 ); yet He showed it not unto them for this, that they
might be deprived of excuse, but that they might obtain excuse. And again in another place,
“The Law entered, that the offense might abound” ( Rom. v. 20 ); yet it was not for this that
it entered, but that sin might be checked. Seest thou everywhere that the conjunction relates
to the consequence? For as some excellent architect may build part of a house, and leave
the rest unfinished, so that to those who believe not he may prove, by means of that remnant,
that he is author of the whole; so also God joineth together and completeth our body, as it
were a house decayed, healing the withered hand, bracing the palsied limbs, straightening
the lame, cleansing the lepers, raising up the sick, making sound the crippled, recalling the
dead from death, opening the eyes that were closed, or adding them where before they were
not; all which things, being blemishes1511 arising from the infirmity of our nature, He by
correcting showed His power.</p>
<p>But when He said, “That the glory of God might be manifested,” He spake of Himself,
not of the Father; His1512 glory was already manifest. For since they had heard that God
made man, taking the dust of the earth, so also Christ made clay. To have said, “I am He
who took the dust of the earth, and made man,” would have seemed a hard thing to His
hearers; but this when shown by actual working, no longer stood in their way. So that He
by taking earth, and mixing it with spittle, showed forth His hidden glory; for no small glory
was it that He should be deemed the Architect of the creation.</p>
<p>And after this the rest also followed; from the part, the whole was proved, since the belief
of the greater also confirmed the less. For man is more honorable than any created thing,
and of our members the most honorable is the eye. This is the cause that He fashioned the
eyes, not in a common manner, but in the way that He did. For though that member be
small in size, yet it is more necessary than any part of the body. And this Paul showed when
he said, “If the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore
not of the body?” ( 1 Cor. xii. 16.) For all indeed that is in us is a manifestation of the wisdom
of God, but much more the eye; this it is that guides the whole body, this gives beauty to it
all, this adorns the countenance, this is the light of all the limbs. What the sun is in the world,
that the eye is in the body; quench the sun, and you destroy and confound all things; quench

<pb n="400"/>
the eyes, and the feet, the hands, the soul, are useless. When these are disabled, even
knowledge is gone, since by means of these we know God. “For the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made.” ( Rom. i. 20.) Wherefore the eye is not only a light to the body, but beyond the body
to the soul also. On which account it is established as in a royal fortress, obtaining the
higher condition, and presiding over the other senses. This then Christ forms.</p>
<p>And that thou mayest not deem that He needeth matter when He worketh, and that
thou mayest learn that He had not need at all of clay, (for He who brought into being the
greater existences when as yet they were not, would much more have made this without
matter,) that I say thou mayest learn that He did not this through necessity, but to show
that He was the Creator at the beginning, when He had spread on the clay He saith, “Go,
wash,” “that thou mayest know that I need not clay to create eyes, but that My glory may
be manifested hereby.” For to show that He spake of Himself when He said, “That the glory
of God may be manifested,” He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “I must work the works of Him that sent Me.”</p>
<p>That is, “I must manifest Myself, and do the things which may show that I do the same
things with the Father”; not things “similar,” but, “the same,” an expression which marks
greater unvaryingness, and which is used of those who do not differ ever so little. Who then
after this will face Him, when he seeth that He hath the same power with the Father? For
not only did He form or open eyes, but gave also the gift of sight, which is a proof that He
also breathed in the soul. Since if that did not work, the eye, though perfected, could never
see anything; so that He gave both the energy1513 which is from the soul, and gave the
member also possessing all things, both arteries and nerves and veins, and all things of which
our body is composed.</p>
<p>“I must work while it is day.”</p>
<p>What mean these words? To what conclusion do they lead? To an important one. For
what He saith is of this kind. “While it is day, while men may believe on Me, while this life
lasteth, I must work.”</p>
<p>“The night cometh,” that is, futurity, “when no man can work.”</p>
<p>He said not, “when I cannot work,” but, “when no man can work”: that is, when there
is no longer faith, nor labors, nor repentance. For to show that He calleth faith, a “work,”
when they say unto Him, “What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?” ( c. vi.
28 ), He replieth, “This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”
How then can no man work this work in the future world?1514 Because there faith is not,
but all, willingly, or unwillingly, will submit. For lest any one should say that He acted as
<note type="footnote">1513 al. “noble birth.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1514 τότε</note>

<pb n="401"/>
He did from desire of honor, He showeth that He did all to spare them who had power to
believe “here” only, but who could no longer “there” gain any good thing. On this account,
though the blind man came not to Him, He did what He did: for that the man was worthy
to be healed, that had he seen he would have believed and come to Christ, that had he heard
from any that He was present, he would not even so have been neglectful, is clear from what
follows, from his courage, from his very faith. For it was likely that he would have considered
with himself, and have said, “What is this? He made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said
to me, ‘Go, wash;’ could he not have healed me, and then have sent me to Siloam? Often
have I washed there with many others, and have gained no good; had he possessed any
power, he would while present have healed me.” Just as Naaman spake respecting Elisha;
for he too being commanded to go wash in Jordan, believed not, and this too when there
was such a fame abroad concerning Elisha. ( 2 Kings v. 11.) But the blind man neither disbelieved,
nor contradicted, nor reasoned with himself, “What is this? Ought he to have put
on clay? This is rather to blind one the more: who ever recovered sight so?” But he used no
such reasonings. Seest thou his steadfast faith and zeal?</p>
<p>“The night cometh.” Next He showeth, that even after the Crucifixion He would care
for the ungodly, and bring many to Himself. For “it is yet day.” But after that, He entirely
cutteth them off, and declaring this, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> As also He said to others, “Believe while the light is with you.”1515 ( c. xii. 36.)
Wherefore then did Paul call this life “night” and that other “day”? Not opposing Christ,
but saying the same thing, if not in words yet in sense; for he also saith, “The night is far
spent, the day is at hand.” ( Rom. xiii. 12.) The present time he calleth “night,” because of
those who sit in darkness, or because he compareth it with that day which is to come, Christ
calleth the future “night,” because there sin has no power to work;1516 but Paul calleth the
present life night, because they are in darkness who continue in wickedness and unbelief.
Addressing himself then to the faithful he said, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand,”
since they should enjoy that light; and he calleth the old life night. “Let us put away,” he
saith, “the works of darkness.” Seest thou that he telleth them that it is “night”? wherefore
he saith, “Let us walk honestly as in the day,” that we may enjoy that light. For if this light
be so good, consider what that will be; as much as the sunlight is brighter than the flame of
a candle, so much and far more is that light better than this. And signifying this, Christ saith,
that “the sun shall be darkened.” Because of the excess of that brightness, not even the sun
shall be seen.</p>

<p>If now in order to have here well-lighted and airy houses, we expend immense sums,
building and toiling, consider how we ought to spend our very bodies themselves, that
glorious houses may be built for us in the heavens where is that Light ineffable. Here there
are strifes and contentions about boundaries and walls, but there will be nothing of the kind
there, no envy, no malice, no one will dispute with us about settling boundaries. This
dwelling too we assuredly needs must leave, but that abideth with us forever; this must decay
by time, and be exposed to innumerable injuries, but that must remain without growing
old perpetually; this a poor man cannot build, but that other one may build with two mites,
as did the widow. Wherefore I choke with grief, that when so many blessings are laid before
us, we are slothful, and despise them; we use every exertion to have splendid houses here,
but how to gain in heaven so much as a little resting-place, we care not, we think not. For
tell me, where wouldest thou have thy dwelling here? In the wilderness, or in one of the
smaller cities? I think not; but in some of the most royal and grand cities, where the traffic
is more, where the splendor is greater. But I will lead thee into such a City, whose Builder
and Maker is God; there I exhort thee to found and build, at less cost [with less labor1517].
That house the hands of the poor build, and it is most truly “building,” just as the structures
made here are the work of extreme folly. For if a man were to bring you into the land of
Persia, to behold what is there and to return, and were then to bid you build houses there,
would you not condemn him for excessive folly, as bidding you spend unseasonably? How
then dost thou this very same thing upon the earth which thou shalt shortly leave? “But I
shall leave it to my children,” saith some one. Yet they too shall leave it soon after thee; nay,
often even before thee; and their successors the same. And even here it is a subject of melancholy
to thee that thou seest not thine heirs retain their possessions, but there thou
needest apprehend nothing of the sort; the possession remaineth immovable, to thee, to thy
children, and to their descendants, if they imitate the same goodness. That building Christ
taketh in hand, he who buildeth that needs not to appoint care-takers, nor be thoughtful,
nor anxious; for when God hath undertaken the work, what need of thought? He bringeth
all things together, and raiseth the house. Nor is this the only thing wonderful, but also that
He so buildeth it as is pleasing to thee, or rather even beyond what is pleasing, beyond what
thou desirest; for He is the most excellent Artist, and careth greatly for thy advantage. If
thou art poor, and desirest to build this house, it brings thee no envy, produces against thee
no malice, for none of those who know how to envy behold it, but the Angels who know
how to rejoice at thy blessings; none will be able to encroach upon it, for none dwell near
it of those who are diseased with such passions. For neighbors thou hast there the saints,
Peter and Paul with their company, all the Prophets, the Martyrs, the multitude1518 of Angels,

of Archangels. For the sake then of all these things,1519 let us empty our substance upon the
poor, that we may obtain those tabernacles;1520 which may we all obtain through the grace

<p>“When Jesus had thus spoken, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and He
anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Those who intend to gain any advantage from what they read, must not pass by
even any small portion of the words; and on this account we are bidden to “search” the
Scriptures, because most of the words, although at first sight1521 easy, appear to have in
their depth much hidden meaning. For observe of what sort is the present case. “Having
said these words,” It saith,“He spat on the ground.” What words? “That the glory of God
should be made manifest,” and that, “I must work the works of Him that sent Me.” For not
without a cause hath the Evangelist mentioned to us His words, and added that, “He spat,”
but to show that He confirmed His words by deeds. And why used He not water instead of
spittle for the clay? He was about to send the man to Siloam: in order therefore that nothing
might be ascribed to the fountain, but that thou mightest learn that the power proceeding
from His mouth, the same both formed and opened the man’s eyes, He “spat on the ground”;
this at least the Evangelist signified, when he said, “And made clay of the spittle.” Then, that
the successful issue might not seem to be of the earth, He bade him wash. But wherefore
did He not this at once, instead of sending him to Siloam? That thou mayest learn the faith
of the blind man, and that the obstinacy of the Jews might be silenced: for it was probable
that they would all see him as he departed, having the clay spread upon his eyes, since by
the strangeness of the thing he would attract to himself all, both those who did and those
who did not know him, and they would observe him exactly. And because it is not easy to
recognize a blind man who hath recovered sight, He first maketh by the length of way many
to be witnesses, and by the strangeness of the spectacle exact observers, that being more attentive
they may no longer be able to say, “It is he: it is not he.” Moreover, by sending him
to Siloam, He desireth to prove that He is not estranged from the Law and the Old (Covenant),
nor could it afterwards be feared that Siloam would receive the glory, since many who
had often washed their eyes there gained no such benefit; for there also it was the power of
Christ that wrought all. On which account the Evangelist addeth for us the interpretation
of the name; for having said, “in Siloam,” he addeth,</p>
<p>“Which is,1522 Sent.”</p>
<p>That thou mayest learn that there also it was Christ who healed him. As Paul saith,
“They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.” ( 1 Cor.
<note type="footnote">1521 αὐτόθεν</note>
<note type="footnote">1522 “is being interpreted,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="405"/>
x. 4.) As then Christ was the spiritual Rock, so also was He the spiritual Siloam. To me also
the sudden1523 coming in of the water seems to hint an ineffable mystery. What is that? The
unlooked for (nature) of His appearance, beyond all expectation.</p>
<p>But observe the mind of the blind man, obedient in everything. He said not, “If it is
really the clay or the spittle which gives me eyes, what need of Siloam? Or if there be need
of Siloam, what need of the clay? Why did he anoint me? Why bid me wash?” But he entertained
no such thoughts, he held himself prepared for one thing only, to obey in all things
Him who gave the command, and nothing that was done offended him. If any one ask,
“How then did he recover his sight, when he had removed the clay?” he will hear no other
answer from us than that we know not the manner. And what wonder if we know it not,
since not even the Evangelist knew, nor the very man that was healed? What had been done
he knew, but the manner of doing it he could not comprehend. So when he was asked he
said, that “He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see”; but how this took place
he cannot tell them, though they ask ten thousand times.</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. “The neighbors therefore, and they which1524 had seen him, that he was a
beggar,1525 said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is he.”</p>
<p>The strangeness of what had been brought to pass led them even to unbelief, though so
much had been contrived1526 that they might not disbelieve. They said, “Is not this he that
sat and begged?” O the lovingkindness of God! Whither did He descend, when with great
kindness He healed even beggars, and so silenced the Jews, because He deemed not the illus-
trious, nor the distinguished, nor the rulers, but men of no mark to be fit objects of the
same Providence. For He came for the salvation of all.</p>
<p>And what happened in the case of the paralytic, happened also with this man, for neither
did the one or the other know who it was that healed him. And this was caused by the retirement
of Christ, for Jesus when He healed always retired, that all suspicion might be removed
from the miracles. Since how could they who knew not who He was flatter Him, or join in
contriving what had been done? Neither was this man one of those who went about, but of
those who sat at the doors of the Temple. Now when all were doubting concerning him,
what saith he?</p>
<p>“I am he.”</p>
<p>He was not ashamed of his former blindness, nor did he fear the wrath of the people,
nor did he decline showing himself that he might proclaim his Benefactor.</p>

A man that is called Jesus.”</p>
<p>What sayest thou? Doth “a man” work such deeds? As yet he knew nothing great concerning
Him.</p>
<p>“A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Observe how truthful he is. He saith not whence He made it, for he speaks not of
what he doth not know; he saw not that He spat on the ground, but that He spread it on he
knew from sense and touch.</p>
<p>“And said unto me, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.”</p>
<p>This too his hearing witnessed to him. But how did he recognize His voice? From His
conversation with the disciples. And saying all this, and having received the witness by the
works, the manner (of the cure) he cannot tell. Now if faith is needed in matters which are
felt and handled, much more in the case of things invisible.</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “They said unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.”</p>
<p>They said, “Where is he?” having already murderous intentions against Him. But observe
the modesty1527 of Christ, how He continued not with those who were healed; because He
neither desired to reap glory, nor to draw a multitude, nor to make a show of Himself. Observe
too how truthfully the blind man maketh all his answers. The Jews desired to find
Christ to bring Him to the priests, but when they did not find Him, they brought the blind
man to the Pharisees, as to those who would question him more severely. For which reason
the Evangelist remarks, that it was “the Sabbath” ( ver. 14 ), in order to point out their wicked
thoughts, and the cause for which they sought Him, as though forsooth they had found a
handle, and could disparage the miracle by means of what appeared to be a transgression
of the Law. And this is clear from their saying immediately on seeing him nothing but, “How
opened he thine eyes?”1528 Observe also the manner of their speech; they say not, “How
didst thou receive thy sight?” but, “How opened he thine eyes?” thus affording him an excuse
for slandering Jesus, because of His having worked. But he speaks to them shortly, as to men
who had already heard; for without mentioning His name, or that “He said unto me, Go,
wash,” he at once saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.”</p>
<p>Because the slander was now become great, and the Jews had said, “Behold what work
Jesus doth on the Sabbath day, he anointeth with clay!” But observe, I pray you, how the
blind man is not disturbed. When being questioned he spake in the presence of those others
without danger, it was no such great thing to tell the truth, but the wonder is, that now when
<note type="footnote">1527 τὸ ἀκόμπαστον</note>
<note type="footnote">1528 These words occur later, ver. 26. The account of the first examination of the blind man is different; ver.
15. “Then again the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight.”</note>

<pb n="407"/>
he is placed in a situation of greater fear, he neither denies nor contradicts what he had said
before. What then did the Pharisees, or rather what did the others also? They had brought
him (to the Pharisees), as being about to deny; but, on the contrary, that befell them which
they desired not, and they learned more exactly. And this they everywhere have to endure,
in the case of miracles; but this point we will more clearly demonstrate in what follows.
What said the Pharisees?</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “Some said,” (not all, but the more forward,) “This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the Sabbath day; others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?”</p>
<p>Seest thou that they were led up1529 by the miracles? For hear what they say now, who
before this had sent to bring Him. And if all did not so, (for being rulers through vainglory
they fell into unbelief,) yet still the greater number even of the rulers believed on Him, but
confessed Him not. Now the multitude was easily overlooked, as being of no great account
in their synagogue, but the rulers being more conspicuous had the greater difficulty in
speaking boldly, or some the love of rule restrained, others cowardice, and the fear of the
many. Wherefore also He said, “How can ye believe who receive honor from men?”1530 (
c. v. 44.) And these who were seeking to kill Him unjustly said that they were of God, but
that He who healed the blind could not be of God, because He kept not the Sabbath; to
which the others objected, that a sinner could not do such miracles. Those first maliciously
keeping silence about what had taken place, brought forward the seeming transgression;
for they said not, “He healeth on the Sabbath day,” but, “He keepeth not the Sabbath.” These,
on the other hand, replied weakly, for when they ought to have shown that the Sabbath was
not broken, they rely only upon the miracles; and with reason, for they still thought that He
was a man. If this had not been the case, they might besides have urged in His defense, that
He was Lord of the Sabbath which Himself had made, but as yet they had not this opinion.
Anyhow, none of them dared to say what he wished openly, or in the way of an assertion,
but only in the way of doubt, some from not having boldness of speech, others through love
of rule.</p>
<p>“There was therefore a division among them.” This division first began among the
people, then later among the rulers also, and some said, “He is a good man”; others, “Nay,
but he deceiveth the people.” ( c. vii. 12.) Seest thou that the rulers were more void of understanding
than the many, since they were divided later than they? and after they were divided,
they did not exhibit any noble feeling, when they saw the Pharisees pressing upon them.
Since had they been entirely separated from them, they would soon have known the truth.
For it is possible to do well in separating. Wherefore also Himself hath said, “I am come not
<note type="footnote">1529 al. “taught.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1530 “one of another,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="408"/>
to bring peace upon the earth but a sword.” ( Matt. x. 34.) For there is an evil concord, and
there is a good disagreement. Thus they who built the tower ( Gen. xi. 4 ), agreed together
to their own hurt; and these same again were separated, though unwillingly, yet for their
good. Thus also Corah and his company agreed together for evil, therefore they were separated
for good; and Judas agreed with the Jews for evil. So division may be good, and agreement
may be evil. Wherefore It saith, “If thine eye offend thee, smite it out,1531 if thy foot,
cut it off.” ( Matt. v. 29, and xviii. 8.) Now if we must separate ourselves from an ill-joined
limb, must we not much more from friends united to us for evil1532 ? So that agreement is
not in all cases a good, just as division is not in all cases an evil.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> These things I say, that we may shun wicked men, and follow the good; for if in the
case of our limbs we cut off that which is rotten and incurable, fearing lest the rest of the
body should catch the same disease, and if we do this not as having no care for that part,
but rather as desiring to preserve the remainder, how much more must we do this in the
case of those who consent with us for evil? If we can set them right without receiving injury
ourselves, we ought to use every means to do so; but if they remain incorrigible and may
injure us, it is necessary to cut them off and cast them away. For so they will often be1533
gainers rather (than losers). Wherefore also Paul exhorted, saying, “And ye shall put away
from among yourselves that wicked person”; and, “that he that hath done this deed may be
put away from among you.” ( 1 Cor. v. 13, 2.) A dreadful thing, dreadful indeed, is the society
of wicked men; not so quickly doth the pestilence seize or the itch infect those that come in
contact with such as are under the disease, as doth the wickedness of evil men. For “evil
communications corrupt good manners.” ( 1 Cor. xv. 33.) And again the Prophet saith,
“Come out from among them, and be ye separate.” ( Isa. lii. 11.) Let no one then have a
wicked man for his friend. For if when we have bad sons we publicly disclaim them, without
regarding nature or its laws, or the constraint which it lays upon us, much more ought we
to fly from our companions and acquaintances when they are wicked. Because even if we
receive no injury from them, we shall anyhow not be able to escape ill report, for strangers
search not into our lives, but judge us from our companions. This advice I address to young
men and maidens. “Providing,”1534 It saith, “things honest,” not only in the sight of the
Lord, but also “in the sight of all men.” ( Rom. xii. 17.) Let us then use every means that our
neighbor be not offended. For a life, though it be very upright, if it offend others hath lost
all. But how is it possible for the life that is upright to offend? When the society of those
that are not upright invests it with an evil reputation; for when, trusting in ourselves, we
<note type="footnote">1531 “pluck it out,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1532 κακῶς ἡνωμένων</note>
<note type="footnote">1533 al. “often are.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1534 “provide,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="409"/>
consort with bad men, even though we be not harmed, we offend others. These things I say
to men and women and maidens, leaving it to their conscience to see exactly how many
evils are produced from this source. Neither I, perhaps, nor any of the more perfect, suspect
any ill; but the simpler brother is harmed by occasion of thy perfection; and thou oughtest
to be careful also for his infirmity. And even if he receive no injury, yet the Greek is harmed.
Now Paul biddeth us be “without offense, both to Jews and Greeks, and to the Church of
God.” ( 1 Cor. x. 32.) (I think no evil of the virgin, for I love virginity, and “love thinketh
no evil” ( 1 Cor. xiii. 5 ); I am a great admirer of that state of life,1535 and I cannot have so
much as an unseemly thought about it.) How shall we per suade those that are without?
For we must take forethought for them also. Let us then so order what relates to ourselves,
that none of the unbelievers may be able even to find a just handle of accusation against us.
For as they who show forth a right life glorify God, so they who do the contrary cause Him
to be blasphemed. May no such persons be among 1536 us: but may our works so shine, that
our Father which is in Heaven may be glorified, and that we may enjoy the honor which is
from Him. To which may we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory forever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John ix. 17, 18</p>
<p>“They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?
He said, He is a Prophet. The Jews then did not believe.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> We must go over the Scriptures not in a chance way or carelessly, but with all exactness,
that we be not entangled. Since even now in this place one might with show of reason
question, how, when they had asserted, “This man is not of God, because he keepeth not
the Sabbath,” they now say to the man, “What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine
eyes?” and not, “What sayest thou of him, that he hath broken the Sabbath?” but put now
that which was the ground of the defense, not that of the accusation. What then have we to
reply? That these (who speak) are not the men who said, “This man is not of God,” but those
who separated themselves from them, who also said, “A man that is a sinner cannot1537 do
such miracles.” For desiring to silence their opponents the more, in order that they may not
seem to be partisans of Christ, they bring forward the man who had received proof of His
power, and question him. Observe now the wisdom of the poor man, he speaketh more
wisely than them all. First he saith, “He is a Prophet”; and shrank not from the judgment1538
of the perverse Jews who spake against Him and said, “How can this man be of God, not
keeping the Sabbath?” but replied to them, “He is a Prophet.”</p>
<p>“And they1539 did not believe that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they
had called his parents.”1540</p>
<p>Observe in how many ways they attempt to obscure and take away the miracle. But this
is the nature of truth, by the very means by which it seems to be assailed by men, by these
it becomes stronger, it shines by means of that by which it is obscured. For if these things
had not taken place, the miracle might have been suspected by the many; but now, as if desiring
to lay bare the truth, so do they use all means, and would not have acted otherwise,
supposing they had done all in Christ’s behalf. For they first attempted to cast Him down
by occasion of this mode (of cure), saying, “How opened he thine eyes?” that is, “was it by
some sorcery?” In another place also, when they had no charge to bring against Him, they
endeavored to insult the mode of the cure, saying, “He doth not cast out devils save by
Beelzebub.” ( Matt. xii. 24.) And here again, when they have nothing to say, they betake
themselves to the time (of cure), saying, “He breaketh the Sabbath”; and again, “He is a

sinner.” Yet He asked you, who would slay1541 Him, and who were ready to lay hold of His
actions, most plainly, saying, “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?” ( c. viii. 46 ); and no
man spake, nor said “Thou blasphemest because thou makest thyself without sin.” But if
they had had it in their power to say so, they would not have held their peace. For they who
because they heard that He was before Abraham would have stoned Him, and said that He
was not of God, who boasted that they, murderers as they were, were of God, but who said
that One who did such wonders, after that He had wrought a cure, was not of God,1542 because
He kept not the Sabbath, if they had had but a shadow of a charge against Him, would
never have let it pass. And if they call Him a sinner because He seemed to break the Sabbath,
this charge also is shown to be unsound, when those who are ranked with them condemn
their great coldness and littleness of soul.1543 Being therefore entangled on every side, they
afterwards betake themselves to something else more shameless and impudent. What is
that? They “did not believe,” It saith, “that he had been blind, and received his sight.” How
then did they charge Christ with not keeping the Sabbath? Plainly, as having believed. But
why gave ye not heed to the great number of people? to the neighbors who knew him? As
I said, falsehood everywhere defeats itself by the very means by which it seems to annoy the
truth, and makes the truth to appear more bright. Which was now the case. For that no one
might say that his neighbors and those who had seen him did not speak with precision, but
guessed from a likeness,1544 they bring forward his parents, by whom they succeeded against
their will in proving that what had taken place was real,1545 since the parents best of all
knew their own child. When they could not terrify the man himself, but beheld him with
all boldness proclaim his Benefactor, they thought to wound the miracle by means of his
parents. Observe the malice of their questioning. For what saith it? Having placed them in
the midst so as to throw them into distress,1546 they apply the questioning with great
severity and anger,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Is this your son?” (and they said not, “who once was blind,” but) “of whom ye
say that he was born blind?”</p>
<p>As if they were acting deceitfully, and plotting on behalf of1547 Christ. O ye accursed,
utterly accursed! What father would choose to invent such falsehoods against his child? For

they almost say, “Whom ye have made out blind, and not only so, but have spread abroad
the report everywhere.”</p>
<p>“How then doth he now see?”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> O folly! “Yours,” saith one, “is the trick1548 and the contrivance.” For by these two
things do they attempt to lead the parents to a denial; by using the words, “Whom ye say,”
and, “How then doth he now see?” Now when there were three questions asked, whether
he was their son, whether he had been blind, and how he received his sight, the parents only
acknowledged two of them, but do not add the third. And this came to pass for the sake of
the truth, in order that none other save the man that was healed, who was also worthy1549
of credit, should acknowledge this matter. And how would the parents have favored (Christ),
when even of what they knew some part they spake not through fear of the Jews? What say
they?</p>
<p>Ver. 20, 21. “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but by what
means he now seeth we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we know not; he is of age,
he shall speak for himself.”</p>
<p>By making him to be worthy of credit, they begged off themselves; “He is not a child,
say they, nor incapable,1550 but able to testify for himself.”</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “These words spake they,1551 because they feared the Jews.”</p>
<p>Observe how the Evangelist again brings forward their opinion and thoughts. This I
say, because of that speech which they before uttered, when they said, “He maketh Himself
equal to God.” ( c. v. 18.) For had that also been the opinion of the Jews but not the judgment
of Christ, he would have added and said, that “it was a Jewish opinion.”1552 When therefore
the parents referred them to him that had been healed, they called him again the second
time, and did not say openly and shamelessly, “Deny that Christ healed thee,” but would
fain effect this under a pretense of piety.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Give,”1553 saith one, “the glory to God.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1548 σκαιώρημα</note>
<note type="footnote">1549 al. “a witness worthy.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1550 ἀ τελὴς</note>
<note type="footnote">1551 “his parents,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1552 Another reading has this sense: “For although that was the opinion of the Jews, yet he hath also added
the judgment of Christ; and hath said that the sentence of the Jews was to put out of the synagogue those who
confessed Him to be the Christ.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1553 N.T. ver. 22–24. “For the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that He was Christ, he
should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age, ask him. Then again called they the
man that was blind, and said unto him.”</note>

<pb n="413"/>
<p>For to have said to the parents, “Deny that he is your son, and that he was born1554
blind,” would have seemed very ridiculous. And again, to have said this to himself would
have been manifest shamelessness. Wherefore they say not so, but manage the matter in
another way, saying, “Give God the glory,” that is, “confess that this man hath wrought
nothing.”</p>
<p>“We know that this man is a sinner.”</p>
<p>“Why then did ye not convict Him when He said, ‘Which of you convinceth Me of sin?’
( c. viii. 46.) Whence know ye that He is a sinner?” After that they had said, “Give God the
glory,” and the man had made no reply, Christ meeting praised him, and did not rebuke
him, nor say, “Wherefore hast thou not given glory to God?” But what said He? “Dost thou
believe on the Son of God?” 1555 ( ver. 35 ), that thou mayest learn that this is “to give glory
to God.” Now had He not been equal in honor to the Father, this would not have been giving
glory; but since he that honoreth the Son honoreth the Father also, the blind is with good
reason not rebuked. Now while they expected that the parents would contradict and deny
the miracle, the Pharisees said nothing to the man himself, but when they saw that they
profited nothing by this, they again return to him, saying, “This man is a sinner.”</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not; one thing I
know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.”</p>
<p>Surely the blind man was not terrified? That be far from him. How then doth he who
said, “He is a Prophet” ( ver. 17 ), now say, “Whether he be a sinner, I know not”? He said
so, not as being in such a state of mind, nor as having persuaded himself of this thing, but
desiring to clear Him from their charges by the testimony of the fact, not by1556 his own
declaration, and to make the defense credible, when the testimony of the good deed done
should decide the matter against them. Since if after many words when the blind man said,
“Except this were a righteous man he could not do such miracles” ( ver. 33 ), they were so
enraged as to reply, “Thou wast altogether born in sin, and dost thou teach us?” what would
they not have said, if he had spoken so from the beginning; what would they not have done?
“Whether he be a sinner or not, I know not”; as though he had said, “I say nothing in this
man’s favor, I make no declaration at present, yet this I certainly know and would affirm,
that if he were a sinner he could not have done such things.” Thus he kept himself free from
suspicion, and his testimony uncorrupted, as not speaking from partiality, but as bearing
witness according to the fact. When therefore they could neither upset nor remove what
had been done, they again return to their former plan, making trifling enquiries about the
manner of the cure, like men1557 who search on every side about a prey which is before

them, and cannot be hurt,1558 hastening round now in one direction, now in another; and
they recur to the man’s former assertions, in order now to make them unsound by continual
questions, and say,</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?”</p>
<p>What was his reply? Having conquered and cast them down, he no longer speaks to
them submissly. As long as the matter needed enquiry and arguments he spake guardedly,
while he supplied the proof; but when he had conquered and gained a splendid victory, he
then takes courage, and tramples upon them. What saith he?</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “I have told you once,1559 and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it
again?”</p>
<p>Seest thou the bold-speaking of a beggar towards Scribes and Pharisees? So strong is
truth, so weak is falsehood. Truth, though she take hold but of ordinary men, maketh them
to appear glorious; the other, even though it be with the strong, shows them weak.1560 What
he saith is of this kind: “Ye give no heed to my words, therefore I will no longer speak or
answer you continually, who question1561 me to no purpose, and who do not desire to hear
in order to learn, but that you may insult over my words.”
“Will ye also be His disciples?”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Now he hath ranked1562 himself among the band of disciples, for the “will ye also?”
is the expression of one who is declaring himself to be a disciple. Then he mocked and annoyed
them abundantly. For since he knew that this struck them hard, he said it, wishing
to upbraid them with exceeding severity; the act of a soul courageous, soaring on high and
despising their madness, pointing out the greatness of this dignity, in which he was very
confident, and showing that they insulted him who was a man worthy to be admired, but
that he took not the insult to himself, but grasped as an honor what they offered as a reproach.
Ver. 28. “Thou art his disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples.”</p>
<p>“But this cannot be. Ye are neither Moses’ nor this Man’s; for were ye Moses’, ye would
become this Man’s also.” Wherefore Christ before said unto them, because they were continually
betaking themselves to these speeches, “Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed
Me, for he wrote of Me.” ( c. v. 46.)</p>

<p>By whose word, whose report? “That of our forefathers,” saith one. Is not He then more
to be believed than your forefathers, who confirmeth by miracles that He came from God,
and that He speaketh things from above? They said not, “We have heard that God spake to
Moses,” but, “We know.” Do ye affirm, O Jews, what ye have by hearing, as knowing it, but
deem what ye have by sight as less certain than what ye have by hearing? Yet the one ye saw
not, but heard, the other ye did not hear, but saw. What then saith the blind man?</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “Why herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not whence He is, and He doeth
such miracles.”1564</p>
<p>“That a Man, who is not one of the distinguished or noble or illustrious among you,
can do such things; so that it is in every way clear that He is God, needing no human aid.”
Ver. 31. “We know that God heareth not sinners.”</p>
<p>Since they had been the first to say, “How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?”
( ver. 16 ), he now brings forward even their judgment, reminding them of their own words.
“This opinion,” saith he, “is common to me and you. Stand fast now to it.” And observe, I
pray you, his wisdom. He turns about the miracle in every way, because they could not do
away with it, and from it he draws his inferences. Seest thou that at first he said “Whether
he be a sinner or not, I know not”? not doubting (God forbid!) but knowing that He was
not a sinner. At least now, when he had an opportunity, see how he defended Him. “We
know that God heareth not sinners”:</p>
<p>“But if any man be a worshiper of God, and doeth His will.”1565</p>
<p>Here he not only hath cleared Him from sin, but declareth that He is very pleasing to
God, and doeth all His will. For since they called themselves1566 worshipers of God, he added,
“and doeth His will”; “since,” saith he, “it is not sufficient to know God: men must also do
His will.” Then he magnifies what had been done, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one
that was born blind.”1567</p>
<p>“If now ye acknowledge1568 that God heareth not sinners, and this Person hath wrought
a miracle, and such a miracle as no man ever wrought, it is clear that He hath surpassed all
things in1569 virtue, and that His power is greater than belongeth to man.” What then say

calling upon him once and a second time. If ye1570 deemed him not trustworthy, why did
ye call and question him a second time? But when he spake the truth, unabashed, then, when
they ought most to have admired, they condemned him. But what is the, “Thou wast altogether
born in sins”? They here unsparingly reproach him with his very blindness, as though
they had said, “Thou art in sins from thy earliest age;” insinuating that on this account he
was born blind; which was contrary to reason. On this point at least Christ comforting him
said, “For judgment I am come into the world, that they which see not might see, and that
they which see might be made blind.” ( c. ix. 39.)</p>
<p>“Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?” Why, what had the man
said? Did he set forth his private opinion? Did he not set forth a common judgment, saying,
“We know that God heareth not sinners”? Did he not produce your own words?</p>
<p>“And they cast him out.”</p>
<p>Hast thou beheld the herald of the truth, how poverty was no hindrance to his true
wisdom? Seest thou what reproaches, what sufferings he bare from the beginning, and how
by word and by deed he testified?</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Now these things are recorded, that we too may imitate them. For if the blind man,
the beggar, who had not even seen Him, straightway showed such boldness even before he
was encouraged by Christ, standing opposed to a whole people, murderous, possessed, and
raving, who desired by means of his voice to condemn Christ, if he neither yielded nor gave
back, but most boldly stopped their mouths, and chose rather to be cast out than to betray
the truth; how much more ought we, who have lived so long in the faith, who have seen ten
thousand marvels wrought by faith, who have received greater benefits than he, have recovered
the sight of the eyes within, have beheld the ineffable Mysteries, and have been
called to such honor, how ought we, I say, to exhibit all boldness of speech towards those
who attempt to accuse, and who say anything against the Christians, and to stop their
mouths, and not to acquiesce without an effort. And we shall be able to do this, if we are
bold,1571 and give heed to the Scriptures, and hear them not carelessly. For if one should
come in here regularly, even though he read not at home, if he attends to what is said here,
one year even is sufficient to make him well versed in them; because we do not to-day read
one kind of Scriptures, and tomorrow another, but always and continually the same. Still
such is the wretched disposition of the many, that after so much reading, they do not even
know the names of the Books, and are not ashamed nor tremble at entering so carelessly
into a place where they may hear God’s word. Yet if a harper, or dancer, or stage-player call

<note type="footnote">1571 i.e. through a good conscience.</note>

<pb n="417"/>
the city, they all run eagerly, and feel obliged to him for the call, and spend the half of an
entire day in attending to him alone; but when God speaketh to us by Prophets and Apostles,
we yawn, we scratch ourselves, we are drowsy. And in summer, the heat seems too great,
and we betake ourselves to the market place; and again, in winter, the rain and mire are a
hindrance, and we sit at home; yet at horse races, though there is no roof over them to keep
off the wet, the greater number, while heavy1572 rains are falling, and the wind is dashing
the water into their faces, stand like madmen, caring not for cold, and wet, and mud, and
length of way, and nothing either keeps them at home, or prevents their going thither. But
here, where there are roofs over head, and where the warmth is admirable, they hold back
instead of running together; and this too, when the gain is that of their own souls. How is
this tolerable, tell me? Thus it happens, that while we are more skilled than any in those
matters, in things necessary we are more ignorant than children. If a man call you a charioteer,
or a dancer, you say that you have been insulted, and use every means to wipe off the
affront; but if he draw you to be a spectator of the action, you do not start away, and the art
whose name you shun, you almost in every case pursue. But where you ought1573 to have
both the action and the name, both to be and to be called a Christian, you do not even know
what kind of thing the action is. What can be worse than this folly?1574 These things I have
desired continually to say to you, but I fear lest I gain hatred in vain and unprofitably. For
I perceive that not only the young are mad, but the old also; about whom I am especially
ashamed, when I see a man venerable from his white hairs, disgracing those white hairs,
and drawing a child after him. What is worse than this mockery? What more shameful than
this conduct? The child is taught by the father to act unseemly.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Do the words sting? This is what I desire, that you should suffer the pain caused by
the words, in order to be delivered from the disgrace caused by the actions. For there are
some too far colder than these, who are not even ashamed at the things spoken of, nay, who
even put together1575 a long argument in defense of the action. If you ask them who was
Amos or Obadiah, or what is the number of the Prophets or Apostles, they cannot even
open their mouth but for horses and charioteers, they compose excuses more cleverly than
sophists or rhetoricians, and after all this, they say, “What is the harm? what is the loss?”
This is what I groan for, that ye do not so much as know that the action is a loss, nor have
a sense of its evils. God hath given to thee an appointed space of life for serving Him, and
dost thou while thou spendest it vainly, and at random, and on nothing useful, still ask,
“What loss is there?” If thou hast spent a little money to no purpose, thou callest it a loss:
<note type="footnote">1572 al. “heavy and violent.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1573 al. “desire.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1574 al. “lawlessness.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1575 al. “are not even ashamed at what takes place at the theaters, but raise.”</note>

<pb n="418"/>
when thou spendest whole days of thine upon the devil’s pageants, thinkest thou that thou
art doing nothing wrong? Thou oughtest to spend all thy life in supplications1576 and
prayers, whereas thou wastest thy life and substance1577 heedlessly, and to thine own hurt,
on shouts, and uproar, and shameful words, and fighting, and unseasonable pleasure, and
actions performed by trickery, and after all this thou askest, “What is the loss?” not knowing
thou shouldest be lavish of anything rather than time.1578 Gold, if thou shalt have spent,
thou mayest get again; but if thou lose time, thou shalt hardly recover that. Little is dealt
out to us in this present life; if therefore we employ it not as we ought, what shall we say
when we depart “there”? For tell me, if thou hadst commanded one of thy sons to learn
some art, and then he had continually stayed at home, or even passed his time somewhere
else, would not the teacher reject him? Would he not say to thee, “Thou hast made an
agreement with me, and appointed a time; if now thy son will not spend this time with me
but in other places, how shall I produce him to thee as a scholar?”1579 Thus also we must
speak. For God will say also to us, “I gave you time to learn this art of piety, wherefore have
ye foolishly and uselessly wasted that time? Why did ye neither go constantly to the teacher,
nor give heed to his words?” For to show that piety is an art, hear what the Prophet saith,
“Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” ( Ps. xxxiv. 11.)
And again, “Blessed is the man whom Thou instructest, Lord, and teachest him out of Thy
Law.” ( Ps. xciv. 12.) When therefore thou hast spent this time in vain, what excuse wilt thou
have? “And why,” saith some one, “did He deal out to us but little time?” O senselessness
and ingratitude! That for which thou wert most bounden to give thanks to Him, for that
He hath cut short thy labors and abridged thy toils, and made the rest long and everlasting,
for this dost thou find fault, and art discontented?</p>
<p>But I know not how we have brought our discourse to this point, and have made it so
long; we must therefore shorten it now. For this too is a part of our wretchedness, that here
if the discourse be long, we all become careless, while there1580 they begin at noon, and retire
by torch and lamp light. However, that we be not always chiding, we now entreat and beseech
you, grant this favor to us and1581 to yourselves; and getting free from all other matters, to
these let us rivet ourselves. So shall we gain from you joy and gladness, and honor on your
account, and a recompense for these labors; while ye will reap all the reward, because having
been aforetime so madly riveted to the stage, ye tore yourselves away, through fear of God,

and by our exhortations, from that malady, and brake your bonds, and hastened unto God.
Nor is it “there” alone that ye shall receive your reward, but “here” also ye shall enjoy pure

pleasant to us. Let us then be persuaded by what has been said, that we may obtain the
blessings both here and hereafter, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John ix. 34–36</p>
<p>“And they cast him out. And Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found
him, He said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, Who
is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?” And the rest.</p>
<p><del>1.</del> They who for the sake of the truth and the confession of1582 Christ suffer anything
terrible and are insulted, these are especially honored. For as he who loseth his possessions
for His sake, the same it is who most findeth them; as he who hateth his own life, the same
it is who most loveth it; so too he who is insulted, is the same who is most honored. As fell
out in the case of the blind man. The Jews cast him out from the Temple, and the Lord of
the Temple found him; he was separated from that pestilent company, and met with the
Fountain of salvation; he was dishonored by those who dishonored Christ, and was honored
by the Lord of Angels. Such are the prizes of truth. And so we, if we leave our possessions
in this world, find confidence in the next; if here we give to the afflicted, we shall have rest
in heaven; if we be insulted for the sake of God, we are honored both here and there.</p>
<p>When they had cast him out from the Temple, Jesus found him. The Evangelist shows,
that He came for the purpose of meeting him. And observe how He recompenseth him, by
that which is the chiefest of blessings. For He made Himself known to him who before knew
Him not, and enrolled him into the company of His own disciples. Observe also how the
Evangelist describes the exact circumstances; for when Christ had said, “Dost thou believe
on the Son of God?” the man replied, “Lord, who is He?” For as yet he knew Him not, although
he had been healed; because he was blind before he came to his Benefactor, and after
the cure, he was being worried by those dogs. Therefore, like some judge at the games, He
receiveth the champion who had toiled much and gained the crown. And what saith He?
“Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” What is this, after so much arguing against the Jews,
after so many words, He asketh him, “Dost thou believe?” He spake it not from ignorance,
but desiring to make Himself known, and showing that He gently valued the man’s faith.
“This great multitude,” He saith, “hath insulted Me, but of them I make no account; for one
thing I care, that thou shouldest believe. For better is one who doeth the will of God, than
ten thousand transgressors.” “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” As having both been
present, and as approving what had been said by him, He asketh this question; and first,1583
He brought him to a state of longing for Himself. For He said not directly, “Believe,” but in
the way of an enquiry. What then said the man? “Lord, who is He, that I might believe on
<note type="footnote">1582 lit. “to.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1583 i.e. before revealing Himself.</note>

<pb n="421"/>
Him?” The expression is that of a longing and enquiring soul. He knoweth not Him in whose
defense he had spoken so much, that thou mayest learn his love of truth. For he had not yet
seen Him.</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with
thee.”</p>
<p>He said not “I am He,” but as yet in an intermediate1584 and reserved manner, “Thou
hast both seen Him.” This was still uncertain; therefore He addeth more clearly, “It is He
that talketh with thee.”</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “He saith, Lord, I believe; and he worshiped Him” (straightway1585).</p>
<p>He said not, “I am He that healed thee, that bade thee, Go, wash in Siloam”; but keeping
silence on all these points, He saith, “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” and then the
man, showing his great earnestness, straightway worshiped; which few of those who were
healed had done; as, for instance, the lepers, and some others; by this act declaring His divine
power. For that no one might think that what had been said by him was a mere expression,
he added also the deed. When he had worshiped, Christ said,</p>
<p>Ver. 39. “For judgment I am come into the world, that they which see not might see,
and that they which see might be made blind.”</p>
<p>So also saith Paul; “What shall we say then? That the Gentiles which followed not after
righteousness have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of the faith
of Jesus; but Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the
law of righteousness.” ( Rom. ix. 30, 31.) By saying, “For judgment I am come into this
world,” He both made the man stronger respecting the faith, and aroused those who followed
Him; for the Pharisees were following Him. And the, “For judgment,” He spake with reference
to a greater punishment; showing that they who had given sentence against Him, had received
sentence against themselves; that they who had condemned Him as a sinner, were themselves
the persons condemned. In this passage He speaketh of two recoveries of sight, and two
blindnesses; one sensible, the other spiritual.</p>
<p>Ver. 40. “Some of them that followed Him, say unto Him,1586 Are we also blind?”</p>
<p>As in another place they said, “We were never servants to any man”; and, “We be not
born of fornication” ( c. viii. 33, 41 ); so now they gape on material things alone, and are
ashamed of this kind of blindness. Then to show that it was better for them to be blind than
seeing, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 41. “If ye were blind, ye should have no sin.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1584 μέσως, al. μέσος</note>
<note type="footnote">1585 not in G. T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1586 “And some of the Pharisees which were with Him heard these words, and said unto Him,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="422"/>
<p>Since they deemed the calamity a matter to be ashamed of, He turneth this back upon
their own head, telling them, that “this very thing would have rendered your punishment
more tolerable”; cutting away on every side their human thoughts, and leading them to a
notion high and marvelous.</p>
<p>“But now ye say, We see.”</p>
<p>As He saith in that other place, “Of whom ye said that He was your God” ( c. viii. 54 );
so too here, “Now ye say that ye see,1587 but ye see not.” He showeth that what they deemed
a great matter for praise, brought punishment upon them. He also comforted him who was
blind from his birth, concerning his former maimed state, and then speaketh concerning
their blindness. For He directeth His whole speech to this end, that they may not say, “We
did not refuse to come to thee owing to our blindness, but we turn away and avoid thee as
a deceiver.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And not without a cause hath the Evangelist mentioned, that they of the Pharisees
who were with Him heard these things, and said, “Are we blind also?” but to remind thee
that these were the men who first withdrew from and then stoned Him, for they were persons
who followed Him superficially, and who easily changed to the contrary opinion. How then
doth He prove that He is not a deceiver, but a Shepherd? By laying down the distinguishing
marks both of the shepherd, and of him who is a deceiver and a spoiler, and from these affording
them opportunity of searching into the truth of the matter. And first He showeth
who is a deceiver and a spoiler, calling him so from the Scriptures, and saying,</p>
<p>Chap. x. ver. 1. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the
sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.”</p>
<p>Observe the marks of a robber; first, that he doth not enter openly; secondly, not according
to the Scriptures, for this is the, “not by the door.” Here also He referreth to those who
had been before, and to those who should be after Him, Antichrist and the false Christs,
Judas and Theudas, and whatever others there have been of the same kind. And with good
cause He calleth the Scriptures “a door,” for they bring us to God, and open to us the
knowledge of God, they make the sheep, they guard them, and suffer not the wolves to come
in after them. For Scripture, like some sure door, barreth the passage against the heretics,
placing us in a state of safety as to all that we desire, and not allowing us to wander; and if
we undo it not, we shall not easily be conquered by our foes. By it we can know all, both
those who are, and those who are not, shepherds. But what is “into the fold”? It refers to the
sheep, and the care of them. For he that useth not the Scriptures, but “climbeth up some
other way,” that is, who cutteth out for himself another and an unusual1588 way, “the same
is a thief.” Seest thou from this too that Christ agreeth with the Father, in that He bringeth
<note type="footnote">1587 “ye say, We see, therefore your sin remaineth,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1588 or, “unlawful.”</note>

<pb n="423"/>
forward the Scriptures? On which account also He said to the Jews, “Search the Scriptures”
( c. v. 39 ); and brought forward Moses, and called him and all the Prophets witnesses, for
“all,” saith He,1589 “who hear the Prophets shall come to Me”; and, “Had ye believed Moses,
ye would have believed Me.” But here He hath put the same thing metaphorically. And by
saying, “climbeth up some other way,” He alluded to the Scribes, because they taught for
commandments the doctrines of men, and transgressed the Law ( Matt. xv. 9 ); with which
He reproached them, and said, “None of you doeth the Law.” ( c. vii. 19.) Well did He say,
“climbeth up,” not “entereth in,” since to climb is the act of a thief intending to overleap a
wall, and who doeth all with danger. Hast thou seen how He hath sketched the robber? now
observe the character of the shepherd. What then is it?</p>
<p>Ver. 2–4. “He that entereth in by the door, the same is the shepherd of the sheep; to him
the doorkeeper openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own by name.1590
And when he hath brought them out, he goeth before them.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> He hath set down the marks of the shepherd, and of the evil doer; let us now see
how He hath fitted to them what followeth. “To him,” He saith, “the doorkeeper openeth”;
He continueth in the metaphor to make the discourse more emphatic. But if thou shouldest
be minded to examine the parable word by word, there is nothing to hinder thee from supposing
Moses to be the doorkeeper, for to him were entrusted the oracles of God. “Whose
voice the sheep hear, and he calleth his own by name.” Because they everywhere said that
He was a deceiver, and confirmed this by their own unbelief, saying, “Which1591 of the
rulers hath believed on him?” ( c. vii. 48.) He showeth that they ought not on account of the
unbelief of those persons to call Him a spoiler and deceiver, but that they, because they gave
no heed to Him were consequently even excluded from the rank of sheep. For if a shepherd’s
part is to enter through the usual door, and if He entered through this, all they who followed
Him might be sheep, but they who rent themselves away, hurt not the reputation of the
Shepherd, but cast themselves out from the kindred of the sheep. And if farther on He saith
that He is “the door,” we must not again be disturbed, for He also calleth Himself “Shepherd,”
and “Sheep,” and in different ways proclaimeth His dispensations. Thus, when He bringeth
us to the Father, He calleth Himself “a Door,” when He taketh care of us, “a Shepherd”; and
it is that thou mayest not suppose, that to bring us to the Father is His only office, that He
calleth Himself a Shepherd. “And the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep,
and leadeth them out, and goeth before them.” Shepherds indeed do the contrary, for they
follow after them; but He to show that He will lead all men to the truth, doeth differently;
as also when He sent the sheep, He sent them, not out of the way of wolves, but “in the midst
<note type="footnote">1589 or, “It saith.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1590 “and leadeth them out,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1591 “Hath any,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="424"/>
of wolves.” ( Matt. x. 16.) For far more wonderful is this manner of keeping sheep than ours.
He seemeth to me also to allude to the blind man, for him too, having “called,” He “led out”
from the midst of the Jews, and the man heard “His voice,” and “knew” it.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “And1592 a stranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers.”</p>
<p>Certainly here He speaketh of Theudas and Judas, (for “all, as many as believed on them,
were scattered” <del> Acts v. 36</del>, It saith,) or of the false Christs who after that time should deceive.
For lest any should say that He was one of these, He in many ways separateth Himself
from them. And the first difference He setteth down is His teaching from the Scriptures;
for He by means of these led men to Him, but the others did not from these draw men after
them. The second is, the obedience of the sheep; for on Him they all believed, not only while
He lived, but when He had died; the others they straightway left. With these we may mention
a third difference, no trifling one. They did all as rebels,1593 and to cause revolts, but He
placed Himself so far from such suspicion, that when they would have made Him a king,
He fled; and when they asked, “Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar?” He bade them pay
it, and Himself gave the two drachm piece. ( Matt. xvii. 27.) Besides this, He indeed came
for the saving of the sheep, “That they might have life, and that they might have more
abundantly” ( ver. 10 ), but the others deprived them even of this present life. They betrayed
those who were entrusted to them and fled, but He withstood so nobly as even to give up
His life. They unwillingly, and by compulsion, and desiring to escape, suffered what they
suffered, but He willingly and by choice endured all.</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “This parable spake Jesus unto them, but they understood not what things they
were which He spake unto them.”</p>
<p>And wherefore spake He obscurely? Because He would make them more attentive; when
He had effected this, He removes the obscurity, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “I am1594 the door, by Me if any man enter in, he1595 shall go in and out, and
find pasture.”</p>
<p>As though He had said, “shall be in safety and security,” (but by “pasture,” He here
meaneth His nurturing and feeding the sheep, and His power1596 and Lordship,) that is,
“shall remain within, and none shall thrust him out.” Which took place in the case of the
Apostles, who came in and went out securely, as having become lords of all the world, and
none was able to cast them out.</p>

<p>Ver. 8. “All that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not
hear them.”</p>
<p>He doth not here speak of the Prophets, (as the heretics assert,) for as many as believed
on Christ did hear them also, and were persuaded by them; but of Theudas and Judas, and
the other exciters of sedition. Besides, He saith, “the sheep did not hear them,” as praising
them; now nowhere is He seen to praise those who refused to hearken to the Prophets, but,
on the contrary, to reproach and accuse them vehe mently; whence it is evident that the,
“did not hear,” refers to those leaders of sedition.</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “The thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.”</p>
<p>Which then took place when all (their followers) were slain and perished.</p>
<p>“But I am come that they might have life, and that they might have more.”1597</p>
<p>And what is “more” than life, tell me? The kingdom of heaven. But He doth not as yet
say this, but dwelleth on the name of “life,” which was known to them.</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “I am the good Shepherd.”</p>
<p>Here He next speaketh concerning the Passion, showing that this should be for the salvation
of the world, and that He came to it not unwillingly. Then again He mentioneth the
character of the shepherd and the hireling.</p>
<p>“For the shepherd1598 layeth down his life.”1599</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “But he that is an hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not,
seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep and fleeth, and the wolf cometh and catcheth
them.”1600</p>
<p>Here He declareth Himself to be Master even as the Father, if so be that He is the
Shepherd, and the sheep are His. Seest thou how He speaketh in a more lofty tone in His
parables, where the sense is concealed; and giveth no open handle to the listeners? What
then doth this hireling? He “seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and the wolf
cometh, and scattereth them.” This those false teachers did, but He the contrary. For when
He was taken, He said, “Let these go their way, that the saying might be fulfilled” ( c. xviii.
8, 9 ), that not one of them was lost. Here also we may suspect a spiritual1601 wolf to be intended;
for neither did Christ allow him to go and seize the sheep. But he is not a wolf only,
but a lion also. “Because our1602 adversary the devil,” It saith, “walketh about as a roaring

lion.” ( 1 Pet. v. 8.) He is also a serpent, and a dragon; for, “Tread ye1603 on serpents and
scorpions.” ( Luke x. 19.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Wherefore, I beseech you, let us remain pasturing beneath this Shepherd; and we
shall remain, if we obey Him, if we hear His voice, if we follow not a stranger. And what is
His voice? “Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the pure in heart, blessed are the merciful.”
( Matt. v. 3, 8, 7.) If thus we do, we shall remain beneath the Shepherd, and the wolf
will not be able to come in; or if he come against us, he will do so to his own hurt. For we
have a Shepherd who so loveth us, that He gave even His life for us. When therefore He is
both powerful and loveth us, what is there to hinder us from being saved? Nothing, unless
we ourselves revolt from Him. And how can we revolt? Hear Him saying, “Ye cannot serve
two masters, God and mammon.” ( Matt. vi. 24.) If then we serve God, we shall not submit
to the tyranny of mammon. And truly a bitterer thing than any tyranny is the desire of
riches; for it brings no pleasure, but cares, and envyings, and plottings, and hatred, and false
accusations, and ten thousand impediments to virtue, indolence, wantonness, greediness,
drunkenness, which make even freemen slaves, nay, worse than slaves bought with money,
slaves not to men, but even to the most grievous of the passions, and maladies of the soul.
Such a one dares many things displeasing to God and men, dreading lest any should remove
from him this dominion. O bitter slavery, and devlish tyranny! For this is the most grievous
thing of all, that when entangled in such evils we are pleased and hug our chain, and dwelling
in a prison house full of darkness, refuse to come forth to the light, but rivet evil upon
ourselves, and rejoice in our malady. So that we cannot be freed, but are in a worse state
than those that work the mines, enduring labors and affliction, but not enjoying the fruit.
And what is in truth worse than all, if any one desire to free us from this bitter captivity, we
do not suffer it, but are even vexed and displeased, being in this respect in no better case
than madmen, or rather in a much more miserable state than any such, inasmuch as we are
not even willing to be delivered from our madness. What? was it for this, O man, that thou
wast brought into the world? Was it for this that thou wast made a man, that thou mightest
work in these mines, and gather gold? Not for this did God create thee in His Image, but
that thou mightest please Him, that thou mightest obtain the things to come, that thou
mightest join the choir of Angels. Why now dost thou banish thyself from such a relationship,
and thrust thyself into the extreme of dishonor and meanness?1604 He who came by the
same birth pangs with thee, (the spiritual birth pangs I mean,) is perishing with hunger, and
thou art bursting with fullness: thy brother goeth about with naked body, but thou providest
garments even for thy garments, heaping up all this clothing for the worms. How much
better would it have been to put them on the bodies of the poor; so would they have remained
<note type="footnote">1603 “I give you power to tread,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1604 lit. “low birth.”</note>

<pb n="427"/>
undestroyed, would have freed thee from all care, and have won for thee the life to come.
If thou wilt not have them to be moth-eaten, give them to the poor, these are they who know
how to shake these garments well. The Body of Christ is more precious and more secure
than the coffer, for not only doth It keep the garments safe, not only doth It preserve them
unconsumed, but even rendereth them brighter. Oftentimes the coffer taken with the garments
causeth thee the utmost loss, but this place of safety not even death can harm. With
It we need neither doors nor bolts, nor wakeful servants, nor any other such security, for
our possessions are free from all treacherous attacks, and are laid up under guard, as we
may suppose things laid up in heaven would be; for to all wickedness that place is inaccessible.
These things we cease not continually to say to you, and you hearing are not persuaded.
The reason is, that we are of a soul which is mean, gaping upon the earth, groveling on the
ground. Or rather, God forbid that I should condemn you all of wickedness, as though all
were incurably diseased. For even if those who are drunk with riches stop their ears against
my words, yet they who live in poverty will be able to look clearly to what I say. “But what,”
saith some one, “hath this to do with the poor? for they have no gold, or any such garments.”
No, but they have bread and cold water, but they have two obols, and feet to visit the sick,
but they have a tongue and speech to comfort the bedridden, but they have house and
shelter to make the stranger their inmate. We demand not from the poor such and such a
number of talents of gold, these we ask from the rich. But if a man be poor, and come to the
doors of others, our Lord is not ashamed to receive even an obol, but will say that He hath
received more from the giver, than from those who cast in much. How many of those who
now stand here would desire to have been born at that time, when Christ went about the
earth in the flesh, to have conversed and sat at meat with Him? Lo, this may be done now,
we may invite Him more than then to a meal, and feast with Him, and that to greater profit.
For of those who then feasted with Him many even perished, as Judas and others like him;
but every one of those who invite Him to their houses now, and share with Him table and
roof, shall enjoy a great blessing. “Come,” it saith, “ye blessed of My Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and
ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in;
sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.” ( Matt. xxv. 34–36.) That
then we may hear these words, let us clothe the naked, let us bring in the stranger, feed the
hungry, give the thirsty drink, let us visit the sick, and look upon him that is in prison, that
we may have boldness and obtain remission of our sins, and share those good things which
transcend both speech and thought. Which may we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might1605 forever. Amen.</p>

<p>John x. 14, 15</p>
<p>“I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth
Me, even so know I the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A great matter, beloved, a great matter it is to preside over a Church: a matter
needing wisdom and courage as great as that of which Christ speaketh, that a man should
lay down his life for the sheep, and never leave them deserted or naked; that he should stand
against the wolf nobly. For in this the shepherd differs from the hireling; the one always
looks to his own safety, caring not for the sheep; the other always seeks that of the sheep,
neglecting his own. Having therefore mentioned the marks of a shepherd, Christ hath put
two kinds of spoilers; one, the thief who kills and steals; the other, one who doth not these
things, but who when they are done doth not give heed nor hinder them. By the first,
pointing to Theudas and those like him; by the second, exposing the teachers of the Jews,
who neither cared for nor thought about the sheep entrusted to them. On which account
Ezekiel of old rebuked them, and said, “Woe,1606 ye shepherds of Israel! Do the shepherds
feed themselves? Do not the shepherds feed the sheep?” ( Ezek. xxxiv. 2 , LXX.) But they
did the contrary, which is the worst kind of wickedness, and the cause of all the rest.
Wherefore It saith, “They have not turned back the strayed, nor sought the lost, nor bound
up the broken, nor healed the sick, because they fed themselves and not the sheep.” ( Ezek.
xxxiv. 4.) As Paul also hath declared in another passage, saying, “For all seek their own, not
the things which are Jesus Christ’s” ( Philip. ii. 21 ); and again, “Let no man seek his own,
but every man his neighbor’s.” ( 1 Cor. x. 24.) From both Christ distinguisheth Himself;
from those who came to spoil, by saying, “I am come that they might have life, and that they
might have more abundantly” ( ver. 10 ); and from those who cared not for the sheep being
carried away by wolves, by never deserting them, but even laying down His life for them,
that the sheep might not perish. For when they desired to kill Him, He neither altered His
teaching, nor betrayed those who believed on Him, but stood firm, and chose to die.
Wherefore He continually said, “I am the good Shepherd.” Then because His words appeared
to be unsupported by testimony, (for though the, “I lay down My life,” was not long after
proved, yet the, “that they might have life, and that they might have more abundantly,” was
to come to pass after their departure hence in the life to come,) what doth He? He proveth
one from the other; by giving His mortal life1607 (He proveth) that He giveth life immortal.
1608 As Paul also saith, “If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death
<note type="footnote">1606 al. “O.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1607 ψυχὴν</note>
<note type="footnote">1608 ζωὴν</note>

<pb n="429"/>
of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved.” ( Rom. v. 10.) And again in
another place, “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
He not with Him also freely give us all things?” ( Rom. viii. 32.)</p>
<p>But wherefore do they not now bring against Him the charge which they did before,
when they said, “Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true?” ( c. viii. 13.) Because
He had often stopped their mouths, and because His boldness towards them had been increased
by His miracles. Then because He said above “And the sheep hear his voice, and
follow him,” lest any should say, “What then is this to those who believe not?” hear what
He addeth, “And I know My sheep, and am known of Mine.” As Paul declared when he
said, “God hath not rejected His people whom He foreknew” ( Rom. xi. 2 ); and Moses, “The
Lord knew those that were His” ( 2 Tim. ii. 19; comp. Num. xvi. 5 ); “those,” He saith, “I
mean, whom He1609 foreknew.” Then that thou mayest not deem the measure of knowledge
to be equal, hear how He setteth the matter right by adding, “I know My sheep, and am
known of Mine.” But the knowledge is not equal. “Where is it equal?” In the case of the
Father and Me, for there, “As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father.” Had He
not wished to prove this, why should He have added that expression? Because He often
ranked Himself among the many, therefore, lest any one should deem that He knew as a
man knoweth, He added, “As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father.” “I know
Him as exactly as He knoweth Me.” Wherefore He said, “No man knoweth the Son1610 save
the Father, nor the Father save the Son” ( Luke x. 22 ), speaking of a distinct kind of knowledge,
and such as no other can possess.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “I lay down My life.” This He saith continually, to show that He is no deceiver. So
also the Apostle, when he desired to show that he was a genuine teacher, and was arguing
against the false apostles, established his authority by his dangers and deaths, saying, “In
stripes above measure, in deaths oft.” ( 2 Cor. xi. 23.) For to say, “I am light,” and “I am life,”
seemed to the foolish to be a matter of pride; but to say, “I am willing to die,” admitted not
any malice or envy. Wherefore they do not say to Him, “Thou bearest witness of thyself,
thy witness is not true,” for the speech manifested very tender care for them, if indeed He
was willing to give Himself for those who would have stoned Him. On this account also He
seasonably introduceth mention of the Gentiles;</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “For other sheep also I have,” He saith, “which are not of this fold, them also
must I bring.”</p>
<p>Observe again, the word “must,” here used, doth not express necessity, but is declaratory
of something which will certainly come to pass. As though He had said, “Why marvel ye if
these shall follow Me, and if My sheep shall hear My voice? When ye shall see others also
<note type="footnote">1609 Ben. “I.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1610 “who the Son is,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>

<pb n="430"/>
following Me and hearing My voice, then shall ye be astonished more.” And be not confounded
when you hear Him say, “which are not of this fold” ( Gal. v. 6 ), for the difference relateth
to the Law only, as also Paul saith, “Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision.”</p>
<p>“Them also must I bring.” He showeth that both these and those were scattered and
mixed, and without shepherds, because the good Shepherd had not yet come. Then He
proclaimeth beforehand their future union, that,</p>
<p>“They shall be one fold.”1611</p>
<p>Which same thing also Paul1612 declared, saying, “For to make in Himself of twain one
new man.” ( Eph. ii. 15.)</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might
take it again.”</p>
<p>What could be more full of humanity than this saying, if so be that on our account our
Lord shall be beloved, because He dieth for us? What then? tell me, was He not beloved
during the time before this; did the Father now begin to love Him, and were we the causes
of His love? Seest thou how He used condescension? But what doth He here desire to prove?
Because they said that He was alien from the Father, and a deceiver, and had come to ruin
and destroy He telleth them, “This if nothing else would persuade Me to love you, namely,
your being so beloved by the Father, that I also am beloved by Him, because I die for you.”
Besides this He desireth also to prove that other point, that He came not to the action unwillingly,
(for it unwillingly, how could what was done cause love?) and that this was especially
known to the Father. And if He speaketh as a man, marvel not, for we have often
mentioned the cause of this, and to say again the same things is superfluous and unpleasant.</p>
<p>“I lay down My life, that I might take it again.”</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it
down, and I have power to take it again.”</p>
<p>Because they often took counsel to kill Him, He telleth them, “Except I will, your labor
is unavailing.” And by the first He proveth the second, by the Death, the Resurrection. For
this is the strange and wonderful thing. Since both took place in a new way, and beyond
ordinary custom. But let us give heed exactly to what He saith, “I have power to lay down
My life.” And who hath not “power to lay down his life”? Since it is in the power of any that
will, to kill himself. But He saith it not so, but how? “I have in such a way the power to lay
it down, that no one can effect this against My will.” And this is a power not belonging to
men; for we have no power to lay it down in any other way than by killing ourselves. And
if we fall into the hands of men who plot against us, and have the power to kill us, we no
<note type="footnote">1611 “and there shall be one fold, one shepherd,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1612 al. “Which Paul also himself.”</note>

<pb n="431"/>
longer are free to lay it down or not, but even against our will they take it from us. Now this
was not the case with Christ, but even when others plotted against Him, He had power not
to lay it down. Having therefore said that, “No man taketh it from Me,” He addeth, “I have
power to lay down My life,” that is, “I alone can decide as to laying it down,” a thing which
doth not rest with us,1613 for many others also are able to take it from us. Now this He said
not at first, (since the assertion would not have seemed credible,) but when He had received
the testimony of facts, and when, having often plotted against Him, they had been unable
to lay hold on Him, (for He escaped from their hands ten thousand times,) He then saith,
“No man taketh it from me.” But if this be true, that other point follows, that He came to
death voluntarily. And if this be true, the next point is also certain, that He can “take it
again” when He will. For if the dying1614 was a greater thing than man could do, doubt no
more about the other. Since the fact that He alone was able to let go His life, showeth that
He was able by the same power to take it again. Seest thou how from the first He proved the
second, and from His death showed that His Resurrection was indisputable?</p>
<p>“This commandment have I received of My Father.”</p>
<p>What commandment was this? To die for the world. Did He then wait first to hear, and
then choose, and had He need of learning it? Who that had sense would assert this? But
before when He said, “Therefore doth My Father love Me,” He showed that the first motion
was voluntary, and removed all suspicion of opposition to the Father; so here when He saith
that He received a commandment from the Father, He declared nothing save that, “this
which I do seemeth good to Him,” in order that when they should slay Him, they might not
think that they had slain Him as one deserted and given up by the Father, nor reproach Him
with such reproaches as they did, “He saved others, himself he cannot save”; and, “If thou
be the Son of God, come down from the cross” ( Matt. xxvii. 42, 40 ); yet the very reason of
His not coming down was, that He was the Son of God.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Then lest on hearing that, “I have received a command from the Father,” thou
shouldest deem that the achievement1615 doth not belong to Him, He hath said preventing
the, “The good Shepherd layeth down His life for the sheep”; showing by this that the sheep
were His, and that all which took place was His achievement, and that He needed no command.
For had He needed a commandment, how could He have said, “I lay it down of Myself”?
for He that layeth it down of Himself needeth no commandment. He also assigneth
the cause for which He doeth this. And what is that? That He is the Shepherd, and the good
Shepherd. Now the good Shepherd needeth no one to arouse him to his duty; and if this be
the case with man, much more is it so with God. Wherefore Paul said, that “He emptied
<note type="footnote">1613 Ben. “you.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1614 i.e. as He died.</note>
<note type="footnote">1615 τὸ κατόρθωμα</note>

<pb n="432"/>
Himself.” ( Philip. ii. 7.) So the “commandment” put here means nothing else, but to show
His unanimity with the Father; and if He speaketh in so humble and human a way, the cause
is the infirmity of His hearers.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “There was a division therefore1616 among the Jews.1617 And some1618 said,
He hath a devil (and is mad1619). Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a
devil: can a devil open the eyes of the blind?”</p>
<p>For because His words were greater than belonged to man, and not of common use,
they said that He had a devil, calling Him so now for the fourth time. For they before had
said, “Thou hast a devil, who seeketh to kill thee?” ( c. vii. 20 ); and again, “Said we not well
that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?” ( c. viii. 48 ); and here, “He hath a devil and is
mad, why hear ye him?” Or rather we should say, that He heard this not for the fourth time,
but frequently. For to ask, “Said we not well that thou hast a devil?” is a sign that they had
said so not twice or thrice, but many times. “Others said, These are not the words of him
that hath a devil: can a devil open the eyes of the blind?” For since they could not silence
their opponents by words, they now brought proof from His works. “Certainly neither are
the words those of one that hath a devil, yet if ye are not persuaded by the words, be ye
shamed by the works. For if they are not the acts of one that hath a devil, and are greater
than belong to man, it is quite clear that they proceed from some divine power.” Seest thou
the argument? That they were greater than belonged to man is plain, from the Jews saying,
“He hath a devil”; that He had not a devil, He showed by what He did.</p>
<p>What then did Christ? He answered nothing to these things. Before this He had replied,
“I have not a devil”; but not so now; for since He had afforded proof by His actions, He afterwards
held His peace. For neither were they worthy of an answer, who said that He was
possessed of a devil, on account of those actions for which they ought to have admired and
deemed Him to be God. And how were any farther refutations from Him needed, when
they opposed and refuted each other? Wherefore He was silent, and bore all mildly. And
not for this reason alone, but also to teach us all meekness and long-suffering.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us now imitate Him. For not only did He now hold His peace, but even came
among them again,1620 and being questioned answered and showed the things relating to
His foreknowledge; and though called “demoniac” and “madman,” by men who had received
from Him ten thousand benefits, and that not once or twice but many times, not only did
He refrain from avenging Himself, but even ceased not to benefit them. To benefit, do I say?

<note type="footnote">1620 πάλιν ἐπέστη</note>

<pb n="433"/>
He laid down His life for them, and while being crucified spake in their behalf to His Father.
This then let us also imitate, for to be a disciple of Christ, is the being gentle and kind. But
whence can this gentleness come to us? If we continually reckon up our sins, if we mourn,
if we weep; for neither doth a soul that dwelleth in the company of so much grief endure to
be provoked or angered. Since wherever there is mourning, it is impossible that there should
be anger; where grief is, all anger is out of the way; where there is brokenness of spirit, there
is no provocation. For the mind, when scourged by sorrow, hath not leisure to be roused,
but will groan1621 bitterly, and weep yet more bitterly. I know that many laugh on hearing
these things, but I will not cease to lament for the laughers. For the present is a time for
mourning, and wailings, and lamentations, since we do many sins both in word and deed,
and hell awaiteth those who commit such transgressions, and the river boiling with a roaring
stream of fire, and banishment from the Kingdom, which is the most grievous thing of all.
When these things then are threatened, tell me, dost thou laugh and bear thee proudly? And
when thy Lord is angered and threatening, dost thou stand careless,1622 and fearest thou
not lest by this thou light for thyself the furnace to a blaze? Hearest thou not what He crieth
out every day? “Ye saw Me1623 an hungered, and gave Me no meat; thirsty, and ye gave Me
no drink; depart ye into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” ( Matt. xxv.) And
these things He threatened every day. “But,” saith some one, “I did give Him meat.” When,
and for how many days? Ten or twenty? But He willeth it not merely for so much time as
this, but as much as thou spendest upon earth. For the virgins also had oil, yet not sufficient
for their salvation; they too lighted their lamps, yet they were shut out from the bridechamber.
And with reason, since the lamps had gone out before the coming of the Bridegroom. On
this account we need much oil, and abundant lovingkindness. Hear at least what the
Prophet saith, “Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy great mercy.” ( Ps. li. 1.)
We therefore must so take pity upon our neighbor, according to His great mercy towards
us. For such as we are towards our fellow-servants, such shall we find our Lord towards
ourselves. And what kind of “mercy” is “great”? When we give not of our abundance, but
of our deficiency. But if we give not even of our abundance, what hope shall there be for us?
Whence shall we have deliverance from those woes? Where shall we be enabled to flee and
to find salvation? For if the virgins after so many and so great toils found no comfort anywhere,
who shall stand forth for us when we hear those fearful words of the Judge Himself,
addressing and reproaching us, because “I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat; for
inasmuch,” It saith, “as ye did it not unto one of the least of these, ye did it not unto Me”;

<pb n="434"/>
saying this not merely of His disciples, nor of those who have taken upon themselves the
ascetic life, but of every faithful man. For such an one though he be a slave, or one of those
that beg in the market-place, yet if he believeth in God, ought by right to enjoy all our good
will. And if we neglect such an one when naked or hungry, we shall hear those words. With
reason. For what difficult or grievous thing hath He demanded of us? What that is not of
the very lightest and easiest? He saith not, “I was sick, and ye restored Me not,” but, “and
ye visited Me not.” He saith not, “I was in prison, and ye delivered Me not,” but, “and ye
came not unto Me.” In proportion therefore as the commands are easy, so is the punishment
greater to them that disobey. For what is easier, tell me, than to walk forth and enter into a
prison? And what more pleasant? For when thou seest some bound, others covered with
filth, others with uncut hair and clothed in rags, others perishing with hunger, and running
like dogs to your feet, others with deep ploughed sides,1624 others now returning in chains
from the market-place, who beg all day and do not collect even necessary sustenance, and
yet at evening are required by those set over them to furnish that wicked and savage service;
1625 though thou be like any stone, thou wilt certainly be rendered kinder; though thou
livest a soft and dissipated life, thou wilt certainly become wiser, when thou observest the
nature of human affairs in other men’s misfortunes; for thou wilt surely gain an idea of that
fearful day, and of its varied punishments. Revolving and considering these things, thou
wilt certainly cast out both wrath and pleasure, and the love of worldly things, and wilt make
thy soul more calm than the calmest harbor; and thou wilt reason concerning that Judgment
seat, reflecting that if among men there is so much forethought, and order, and terror, and
threatenings, much more will there be with God. “For there is no power but from God.” (
Rom. xiii. 1.) He therefore who permitteth rulers to order these things thus, will much more
do the same Himself.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And certainly were there not this fear, all would be lost, when though such punishments
hang over them, there are many who go over to the side of wickedness. These things
if thou wisely observe, thou wilt be more ready-minded towards alms-doing, and wilt reap
much pleasure, far greater than those who come down from the theater. For they when they
remove from thence are inflamed and burn with desire. Having seen those women hovering
1626 on the stage, and received from them ten thousand wounds, they will be in no better
condition than a tossing sea, when the image of the faces, the gestures, the speeches, the
walk, and all the rest, stand before their eyes and besiege their soul. But they who come forth
from a prison will suffer nothing of this kind, but will enjoy great calm and tranquillity. For
<note type="footnote">1624 πλευρὰς διωρυγμένους</note>
<note type="footnote">1625 λειτουργίαν seems to mean a daily contribution demanded by the keepers out of the sum which prisoners
gained by begging.</note>
<note type="footnote">1626 lit. “winged.”</note>

<pb n="435"/>
the compunction arising from the sight of the prisoners, quenches all that fire. And if a
woman that is an harlot and a wanton meet a man coming forth from among the prisoners,
she will work him no mischief. For becoming for the time to come, as it were, incapable of
molding,1627 he will thus not be taken by the nets of her countenance, because instead of
that wanton countenance there will then be placed before his eyes the fear of the Judgment.
On this account, he who had gone over every kind of luxury said, “It is better to go into the
house of mourning than into the house of mirth.” ( Eccl. vii. 2.) And so “here” thou wilt
show forth great wisdom, and “there” wilt hear those words which are worth ten thousand
blessings. Let us then not neglect such a practice and occupation. For although we be not
able to bring them food, nor to help them by giving money, yet shall we be able to comfort
them by our words, and to raise up the drooping spirit, and to help them in many other
ways by conversing with those who cast them into prison, and by making their keepers
kinder, and we certainly shall effect either small or great good. But if thou sayest that the
men there are neither men of condition,1628 nor good, nor gentle, but man-slayers, tombbreakers,
cut-purses, adulterers, intemperate, and full of many wickednesses, by this again
thou showest to me a pressing reason for spending time there. For we are not commanded
to take pity on the good and to punish the evil, but to manifest this lovingkindness to all
men. “Be ye,” It saith, “like to My Father1629 which is in heaven, for He maketh His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” ( Matt. v.
45.) Do not then accuse other men’s faults bitterly, nor be a severe judge, but mild and
merciful. For we also, if we have not been adulterers, or tomb-breakers, or cut-purses, yet
have we other transgressions which deserve infinite punishment. Perchance we have called
our brother “fool,” which prepares1630 for us the pit; we have looked on women with unchastened
eyes, which constitutes absolute adultery; and what is more1631 grievous than all,
we partake not worthily of the Mysteries, which maketh us guilty of the Body and Blood of
Christ. Let us then not be bitter enquirers into the conduct of others, but consider our own
state, so shall we desist from this inhumanity and cruelty. Besides this, it may be said that
we shall there find many good men, and often men worth as much as all the city. Since even
that prison-house in which Joseph was had in it many evil men, yet that just man had the
care of them all, and was, with the rest, concealed as to his real character; for he was worth
as much as all the land of Egypt, yet still he dwelt in the prison-house, and no one knew him
of those that were within it. Thus also even now it is likely that there are1632 many good

and virtuous men, though they be not visible to all men, and the care thou takest of such as
these gives thee a return for thy exertions in favor of the whole. Or if there be none such,
still even in this case great is thy recompense; for thy Lord conversed not with the just only,
while He avoided the unclean, but received with kindness both the Canaanitish woman,
and her of Samaria, the abominable and impure; another also who was a harlot, on whose
account the Jews reproached Him, He both received and healed, and allowed His feet to be
washed by the tears of the polluted one, teaching us to condescend to those that are in sin,
for this most of all is kindness. What sayest thou? Do robbers and tomb-breakers dwell in
the prison? And, tell me, are all they just men that dwell in the city? Nay, are there not many
worse even than these, robbing with greater shamelessness? For the one sort, if there be no
other excuse for them, at least put before themselves the veil of solitude and darkness, and
the doing these things clandestinely; but the others throw away the mask and go after their
wickedness with uncovered head, being violent, grasping, and covetous. Hard it is to find
a man pure from injustice.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> If we do not take by violence gold, or such and such a number of acres of land, yet
we bring about the same end by deceit and robbery in lesser matters, and where we are able
to do so. For when in making contracts, or when we must buy or sell anything, we dispute
and strive to pay less than the value, and use our utmost endeavors to have it so, is not the
action robbery? Is it not theft and covetousness? Tell not me that thou hast not wrested
away houses or slaves, for injustice is judged not by the measure of the things taken, but by
the intention of those who commit the robbery. Since “just” and “unjust” have the same
force in great and in little things; and I call cut-purses alike the man who cuts through a
purse and takes the gold, and him who buying from any of the market people deducts
something from the proper price; nor is he the only house-breaker who breaks through a
wall and steals anything within, but that man also who corrupts justice, and takes anything
from his neighbor.</p>
<p>Let us not then pass by our own faults, and become judges of other men’s; nor let us,
when it is time for lovingkindness, be searching out their wickedness; but considering what
our own state was once, let us now be gentle and kind. What then was our state? Hear Paul
say; “For we ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers
lusts and pleasures, hateful, and hating one another” ( Tit. iii. 3 ); and again, “We were by
nature children of wrath.” ( Eph. ii. 3.) But God seeing us as it were confined in a prisonhouse,
and bound with grievous chains, far more grievous than those of iron, was not
ashamed of us, but came and entered the prison, and, though we deserved ten thousand
punishments, both brought us out from hence, and brought us to a kingdom, and made us
more glorious than the heaven, that we also might do the same according to our power. For
when He saith to His disciples, “If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also
ought to wash one another’s feet; for I have given you an example, that ye should do as I

<pb n="437"/>
have done to you” ( c. xiii. 14 ), He writeth this law not merely for the washing the feet, but
also in all the other acts which He manifested towards us. Is it a manslayer who inhabits the
prison? Yet let not us be weary in doing Him good. Is it a tomb-breaker, or an adulterer?
Let us pity not his wickedness, but his calamity. But often, as I before said, one will be found
there worth ten thousand; and if thou goest continually to the prisoners, thou shalt not miss
so great a prize. For as Abraham, by entertaining even common guests, once met with Angels,
so shall we meet with great men too, if we make the action a business. And if I may make a
strange assertion, he who entertains a great man is not so worthy of praise as he who receives
the wretched and miserable. For the former hath, in his own life, no slight occasion of being
well treated, but the other, rejected and given up by all, hath one only harbor, the pity of his
benefactor; so that this most of all is pure kindness. He, moreover, who shows attention to
an admired and illustrious man, doth it often for ostentation among men, but he who tends
the abject and despairing, doth it only because of the command of God. Wherefore, if we
make a feast, we are bidden to entertain the lame and halt, and if we do works of mercy, we
are bidden to do them to the least and meanest. “For,” It saith, “inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto Me.” ( Matt. xxv. 45.) Knowing,
therefore, the treasure which is laid up in that place,1633 let us enter continually, and make
it our business, and turn1634 there our eager feelings about theaters. If thou hast nothing to
contribute, contribute the comfort of thy words. For God recompenseth not only him that
feedeth, but him also who goeth in. When thou enterest and arouseth the trembling and
fearful soul, exhorting, succoring, promising assistance, teaching it true wisdom, thou shalt
thence reap no small reward. For if thou shouldest speak in such manner outside the prison,
many will even laugh, being dissipated 1635 by their excessive luxury: but those who are in
adversity, having their minds humbled, shall meekly attend to thy words, and praise them,
and become better men. Since even when Paul preached, the Jews often derided him, but
the prisoners listened with much stillness. For nothing renders the soul so fit for heavenly
wisdom as calamity and temptation, and the pressure of affliction. Considering all these
things, and how much good we shall work both to those within the prison, and to ourselves,
by being continually mixed1636 up with them, let us there spend the time we used to spend
in the market-place, and in unseasonable occupations, that we may both win them and
gladden ourselves, and by causing God to be glorified, may obtain the everlasting blessings,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom,
to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXI.</head>
<p>John x. 22–24</p>
<p>“And it was at Jerusalem, the Feast of the dedication, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in
the temple in Solomon’s porch. Then came the Jews round about Him, and said unto Him,
How long dost thou make us to doubt?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Every virtue is a good thing, but most of all gentleness and meekness. This showeth
us men; this maketh us to differ from wild beasts; this fitteth us to vie with Angels. Wherefore
Christ continually expendeth many words about this virtue, bidding us be meek and gentle.
Nor doth He merely expend words about it, but also teacheth it by His actions; at one time
buffeted and bearing it, at another reproached and plotted against; yet again coming to those
who plotted against Him. For those men who had called Him a demoniac, and a Samaritan
and who had often desired to kill Him, and had cast stones at Him, the same surrounded
and asked Him, “Art thou the Christ?” Yet not even in this case did He reject them after so
many and so great plots against Him, but answered them with great gentleness.</p>
<p>But it is necessary rather to enquire into the whole passage from the beginning.</p>
<p>“It was,” It saith, “at Jerusalem, the Feast of the dedication, and it was winter.” This feast
was a great and national one. For they celebrated with great zeal the day on which the Temple
was rebuilt, on their return from their long captivity in Persia. At this feast Christ also was
present, for henceforth He continually abode in Judæa, because the Passion was nigh.1637
“Then came the Jews round about Him, and said, How long dost thou make us to doubt?”
“If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.”</p>
<p>He did not reply, “What enquire ye1638 of Me? Often have ye called Me demoniac,
madman, and Samaritan, and have deemed me an enemy of God, and a deceiver, and ye
said but now, Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true; how is it then that ye
seek and desire to learn from Me, whose witness ye reject?” But He said nothing of the kind,
although He knew that the intention with which they made the enquiry was evil. For their
surrounding Him and saying, “How long dost thou make us to doubt?” seemed to proceed
from a certain longing and desire of learning, but the intention with which they asked the
question was corrupt and deceitful. For since His works admitted not of their slander and
insolence, while they might attack His sayings by finding out in them a sense other than
that in which they were spoken, they continually proposed questions, desiring to silence
Him by means of His sayings; and when they could find no fault with His works, they wished
to find a handle in His words. Therefore they said, “Tell us”; yet He had often told them.
<note type="footnote">1637 lit. “at the doors.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1638 or, “What seek ye.”</note>

<pb n="439"/>
For He said to the woman of Samaria, “I Am that speak unto thee” ( c. iv. 26 ); and to the
blind man, “Thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.” ( c. ix. 37.) And
He had told them also, if not in the same, at least in other words. And indeed, had they been
wise, and had they desired to enquire aright, it remained for them to confess Him by words,
since by works He had often proved the point in question. But now observe their perverse
and disputations temper. When He addresseth them, and instructeth them by His words,
they say, “What sign showest thou us?” ( c. vi. 30.) But when He giveth them proofs by His
works, they say to Him, “Art thou the Christ? Tell us plainly”; when the works cry aloud,
they seek words, and when the words teach, then they betake themselves to works, ever
setting themselves to the contrary. But that they enquired not for the sake of learning, the
end showed. For Him whom they deemed to be so worthy of credit, as to receive His witness
of Himself, when He had spoken a few words they straightway stoned; so that their very
surrounding and pressing upon Him was done with ill intent.</p>
<p>And the mode of questioning was full of much hatred. “Tell us plainly, Art thou the
Christ?” Yet He spake all things openly, being ever present at their feasts, and in secret He
said nothing; but they brought forward words of deceit, “How long dost thou make us to
doubt?” in order that having drawn Him out, they might again find some handle against
Him. For that in every case they questioned Him not in order to learn, but to find fault with
His words, is clear, not from this passage only, but from many others also. Since when they
came to Him and asked, “Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?” ( Matt. xxii. 17 ),
when they spake about putting away a wife ( Matt. xix. 3 ), when they enquired about her
who, they said, had had seven husbands ( Matt. xxii. 23 ), they were convicted of bringing
their questions to Him, not from desire of learning, but from an evil intention. But there
He rebuked them, saying, “Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites?” showing that He knew their
secret thoughts, while here He said nothing of the kind; teaching us not always to rebuke
those who plot against us, but to bear many things with meekness and gentleness.</p>
<p>Since then it was a sign of folly, when the works proclaimed Him aloud, to seek the
witness of words, hear how He answereth them, at once hinting to them that they made
these enquiries superfluously, and not for the sake of learning, and at the same time showing
that He uttered a voice plainer than that by words, namely, that by works.</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “I told you often,”1639 He saith, “and ye believe not: the works that I do in My
Father’s Name, they are they that bear witness of Me.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> A remark which the more tolerable among them continually made to one another;
“A man that is a sinner cannot1640 do such miracles.” And again, “A devil cannot open the
eyes of the blind”: and, “No man can do such miracles except God be with him.” ( c. iii. 2.)
<note type="footnote">1639 “I told you,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1640 “How can,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>

<pb n="440"/>
And beholding the miracles that He did, they said, “Is not this the Christ?” Others said,
“When Christ cometh, will He do greater miracles than those which this Man hath done?”
( c. vii. 31.) And these very persons as many as then desired to believe on Him, saying, “What
sign showest thou us, that we may see, and believe thee?” ( c. vi. 30.) When then they who
had not been persuaded by such great works, pretended that they should be persuaded by
a bare word, He rebuketh their wickedness, saying, “If ye believe not My works, how will
ye believe My words? so that your questioning is superfluous.”</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “But,” He saith, “I told you, and ye1641 believe not, because ye are not of My
sheep.”1642</p>
<p>“For I on My part have fulfilled all that it behooved a Shepherd to do, and if ye follow
Me not, it is not because I am not a Shepherd, but because ye are not My sheep.”</p>
<p>Ver. 27–30. “For My sheep hear My voice,1643 and follow Me; and I give unto them
eternal life1644 ; neither can1645 any man pluck them out of My hand. The Father,1646 which
gave them Me, is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father’s hand.
I and the Father are One.”</p>
<p>Observe how in renouncing He exciteth them to follow Him. “Ye hear Me not,” He
saith, “for neither are ye sheep, but they who follow, these are of the flock.” This He said,
that they might strive to become sheep. Then by mentioning what they should obtain, He
maketh these men jealous, so as to rouse them, and cause them to desire such things.</p>
<p>“What then? Is it through the power of the Father that no man plucketh them away,
and hast thou no strength, but art too weak to guard them?” By no means. And in order
that thou mayest learn that the expression, “The Father which gave them to Me,” is used on
their account, that they might not again call Him an enemy of God, therefore, after asserting
that, “No man plucketh them out of My hand,” He proceedeth to show, that His hand and
the Father’s is One. Since had not this been so, it would have been natural for Him to say,
“The Father which gave them to Me is greater than all, and no man can pluck them out of
My hand.” But He said not so, but, “out of My Father’s hand.” Then that thou mayest not
suppose that He indeed is weak, but that the sheep are in safety through the power of the
Father, He addeth, “I and the Father are One.” As though He had said “I did not assert that
on account of the Father no man plucketh them away, as though I were too weak to keep
the sheep. For I and the Father are One.” Speaking here with reference to Power, for con-
<note type="footnote">1641 “But ye,” U+0026c. </note>

<note type="footnote">1643 “and I know them.”</note>

<pb n="441"/>
cerning this was all His discourse; and if the power1647 be the same, it is clear that the Essence
is also. And when the Jews used ten thousand means, plotting and casting men out of their
synagogues, He telleth them that all their contrivances are useless and vain; “For the sheep
are in My Father’s hand”; as the Prophet saith, “Upon My hand I have pictured thy walls.”
( Isa. xlix. 16.) Then to show that the hand is One, He sometimes saith that it is His own,
sometimes the Father’s. But when thou hearest the word “hand,” do not understand anything
material, but the power, the authority. Again, if it was on this account that no one could
pluck away the sheep, because the Father gave Him power, it would have been superfluous
to say what follows, “I and the Father are One.” Since were He inferior to Him, this would
have been a very daring saying, for it declares nothing else than an equality of power; of
which the Jews were conscious, and took up stones to cast at Him. ( Ver. 31.) Yet not even
so did He remove this opinion and suspicion; though if their suspicion were erroneous, He
ought to have set them right, and to have said, “Wherefore do ye these things? I spake not
thus to testify that my power and the Father’s are equal”; but now He doth quite the contrary,
and confirmeth their suspicion, and clencheth it, and that too when they were exasperated.
For He maketh no excuse for what had been said, as though it had been said ill, but rebuketh
them for not entertaining a right opinion concerning Him. For when they said,</p>
<p>Ver. 33–36.1648 “For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because
that thou being a man makest thyself God”; hear His answer;1649 “If the Scripture called1650
them gods unto whom the word of God came,1651 how say ye that I blaspheme, because I
said, I am the Son of God?”</p>
<p>What He saith is of this kind: “If those who have received this honor by grace, are not
found fault with for calling themselves gods, how can He who hath this by nature deserve
to be rebuked?” Yet He spake not so, but proved it at a later time, having first relaxed and
yielded somewhat in His discourse, and said, “Whom the Father hath sanctified and sent.”
And when He had softened their anger, He bringeth forward the plain assertion. For a while,
that His speech might be received, He spoke in a humbler strain, but afterwards He raised
it higher, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 37, 38. “If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not; but if I do, though ye
believe not Me, believe the works.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1647 i.e. of the Father and the Son.</note>
<note type="footnote">1648 Ver. 31, 32 , omitted. “Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, Many
good works have I showed you from My Father; for which of those works do ye stone Me? ”</note>

world, Thou blasphemest,” U+0026c., N.T. The comment looks as if this had been read.</note>

<pb n="442"/>
<p>Seest thou how He proveth what I said, that He is in nothing inferior to the Father, but
in every way equal to Him? For since it was impossible to see His Essence, from the equality
and sameness of the works He affordeth a proof of unvaryingness as to Power. And what,
tell me, shall we believe?</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “That I am in the Father, and the Father in Me.”1652</p>
<p>“For I am nothing other than what the Father is, yet still Son; He nothing other than
what I am, yet still Father. And if any man know Me, he knoweth the Father, and if he
knoweth the Father,1653 he hath learnt also the Son.” Now were the power inferior, then
also what relateth to the knowledge would be false, for it is not possible to become acquainted
with one substance or power by means of another.</p>
<p>Ver. 39–41. “Therefore they sought again to take Him, but He escaped out of their
hands, and went away again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized.1654
And many resorted unto Him, and said, John did no miracle, but all things that John spake
of this man were true.”</p>
<p>When He hath uttered anything great and sublime, He quickly retireth, giving way to
their anger, so that the passion may abate and cease through His absence. And thus He acted
at that time. But wherefore doth the Evangelist mention the place? That thou mayest learn
that He went there to remind them of the things there done and said by John, and of his
testimony; at least when they came there, they straightway remembered John. Wherefore
also they said, “John indeed did no miracle,” since how did it follow that they should add
this, unless the place had brought the Baptist to their memory, and they had come to remember
his testimony. And observe how they form incontrovertible syllogisms. “John indeed
did no miracle,” “but this man doth,” saith some one; “hence therefore his superiority is
shown. If therefore men1655 believed him who did no miracles, much more must they believe
this man.” Then, since it was John who bore the witness, lest his having done no miracle
might seem to prove him unworthy of being a witness,1656 they added, “Yet if he did no
miracle, still he spake all things truly concerning this man”; no longer proving Christ to be
trustworthy by means of John, but John to be so by what Christ had done.</p>
<p>Ver. 42. “Many therefore believed on Him.”1657 There were many things that attracted
them. They remembered the words which John had spoken, calling Christ “mightier than
himself,” and “light,” and “life,” and “truth,” and all the rest. They remembered the Voice

which came down from heaven, and the Spirit which appeared in the shape of a dove, and
pointed Him out to all; and with this they recollected the demonstration afforded by the
miracles, looking to which they were for the future established. “For,” saith some one, “if it
was right that we should believe John, much more ought we to believe this man; if him
without miracles, much more this man, who besides the testimony of John, hath also the
proof1658 from miracles.” Seest thou how much the abiding in this place, and the being freed
from the presence of evil men, profited them? wherefore Jesus continually leadeth and
draweth them away from the company of those persons; as also He seemeth to have done
under the old Covenant, forming and ordering the Jews in all points, in the desert, at a distance
from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>And this He now adviseth us also to do, bidding us avoid public places, and tumults,
and disturbances, and pray peacefully in the chamber. For the vessel which is free from
confusion, sails with a fair wind, and the soul which is separated from worldly matters rests
in harbor. Wherefore women ought to have more true wisdom than men, because they are
for the most part riveted to keeping at home. So, for instance, Jacob was a plain 1659 man,
because he dwelt at home, and was free from the bustle of public life; for not without a cause
hath Scripture put this, when It saith, “dwelling in a house.” ( Gen. xxv. 27.) “But,” saith
some woman, “even in a house there is great confusion.” Yes, when thou wilt have it so, and
bringest about thyself a crowd of cares. For the man who spends his time in the midst of
the market-places and courts of justice is overwhelmed, as if by waves, by external troubles;
but the women who sits in her house as in some school of true wisdom, and collects her
thoughts within herself, will be enabled to apply herself to prayers, and readings, and other
heavenly wisdom. And as they who dwell in deserts have none to disturb them, so she being
continually within can enjoy a perpetual calm. Nor even if at any time she need to go forth,
is there then any cause for confusion. For the necessary occasions for a women to leave her
house are, either for the purpose of coming hither, or when the body need to be cleansed
in the bath; but for the most part she sits at home, and it is possible for her both to be herself
truly wise, and receiving her husband when agitated to calm and compose him, to abate the
excess and fierceness of his thoughts, and so to send him forth again, having put off all the
mischiefs which he collected from the market-place, and carrying with him whatever good
he learnt at home. For nothing, nothing is more powerful than a pious and sensible women
to bring a man into proper order, and to mould his soul as she will. For he will not endure
friends, or teachers, or rulers, as he will his partner advising and counseling him, since the
advice carries even some pleasure with it, because she who gives the counsel is greatly loved.
I could tell of many hard and disobedient men who have been softened in this way. For she
<note type="footnote">1658 al. “after the proof of his testimony and,” U+0026c. </note>
<note type="footnote">1659 ἄ πλαστος</note>

<pb n="444"/>
who shares his table, his bed, and his embraces, his words and secrets, his comings in and
goings out, and many other things, who is entirely given up1660 and joined to him, as it is
likely that a body would be joined to a head, if she happen to be discreet and well attuned,
will go beyond and excel all others in the management of her husband.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Wherefore I exhort women to make this their employment, and to give fitting
counsel. For as they have great power for good, so have they also for evil. A women destroyed
Absalom, a woman destroyed Amnon, a woman was like to have destroyed Job, a woman
rescued Nabal from the slaughter. Women have preserved whole nations; for Deborah and
Judith exhibited successes worthy of men; so also do ten thousand other women. Wherefore
Paul saith, “For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?” ( 1 Cor.
vii. 16.) And in those times we see Persis and Mary and Priscilla taking part in the labors1661
of the Apostles ( Rom. 16 ); whom we1662 also needs must imitate, and not by words only,
but also by actions, bring into order him that dwelleth with us. But how shall we instruct
him by our actions? When he sees that thou art not evilly disposed, not fond of expense or
ornament, not demanding extravagant supplies of money, but content with what thou hast,
then will he endure thee counseling him. But if thou art wise in word, and in actions doest
the contrary, he will condemn thee for very foolish talking. But when together with words
thou affordest him also instruction by thy works, then will he admit thee and obey thee the
more readily; as when thou desirest not gold, nor pearls, nor costly clothing, but instead of
these, modesty, sobriety, kindness; when thou exhibitest these virtues on thy part and requirest
them on his. For if thou must needs do somewhat to please thy husband, thou
shouldest adorn thy soul, not adorn and so spoil thy person. The gold which thou puttest
about thee will not make thee so lovely and desirable to him, as modesty and kindness towards
himself, and a readiness to die for thy partner; these things most subdue men. Indeed, that
splendor of apparel even displeases him, as straitening his means, and causing him much
expense and care; but those things which I have named will rivet a husband to a wife; for
kindness and friendship and love cause no cares, give rise to no expense, but quite the contrary.
That outward adornment becomes palling by use, but that of the soul blooms day by
day, and kindles a stronger flame. So that if thou wouldest please thy husband, adorn thy
soul with modesty, piety, and management of the house. These things both subdue him
more, and never cease. Age destroys not this adornment, sickness wastes it not. The adornment
of the body length of time is wont to undo, sickness and many other things to waste,
but what relates to the soul is above all this. That adornment causes envy, and kindles jealousy,
but this is pure from disease, and free from all vainglory. Thus will matters at home
<note type="footnote">1660 al. “bound.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1661 σκαμμάτων, “the arena,” hence any severe labor.</note>
<note type="footnote">1662 Ben. “you.”</note>

<pb n="445"/>
be easier, and your income without trouble, when the gold is not laid on about your body
or encircling your arms, but passes on1663 to necessary uses, such as the feeding of servants,
the necessary care of children, and other useful purposes. But if this be not the case, if the
(wife’s) face be covered with ornaments, while the (husband’s) heart is pressed by anxiety,
what profit, what kind of advantage is there? The one being grieved allows not the marvelous
beauty of the other to be seen. For ye know, ye know that though a man see the most beautiful
of all women, he cannot feel pleasure at the sight while his soul is sorrowful, because
in order to feel pleasure a man must first rejoice and be glad. And when all his gold is heaped
together to adorn a woman’s body, while there is distress in his dwelling, her partner can
have no pleasure. So that if we desire to be agreeable to our husbands, let us give them
pleasure; and we shall give them pleasure, if we remove our ornaments and fineries. For all
these things at the actual time of marriage appear to afford some delight, but this afterwards
fades by time. Since if when the heaven is so beautiful, and the sun, to which thou canst not
name any body that is equal, so bright, we admire them less from habitually seeing them,
how shall we admire a body tricked out with gewgaws? These things I say, desiring that you
should be adorned with that wholesome adornment which Paul enjoined; “Not with gold,
or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
works.” ( 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10.) But dost thou wish to please strangers, and to be praised by them?
Then assuredly this is not the desire of a modest woman. However, if thou wishest it, by
doing as I have said, thou wilt have strangers also to love thee much, and to praise thy
modesty. For the woman who adorns her person no virtuous and sober person will praise,
but the intemperate and lascivious; nay, rather neither will these praise her, but will even
speak vilely of her, having their eyes inflamed by the wantonness displayed about her; but
the other all will approve, both the one sort and the other, because they receive no harm
from her, but even instruction in heavenly wisdom. And great shall be her praise from men,
and great her reward with God. After such adornment then let us strive, that we may live
here without fear, and may obtain the blessings which are to come; which may we all obtain
through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xi. 1, 2</p>
<p>“Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, of the town of Mary and her sister
Martha. It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment.”1664</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Many men, when they see any of those who are pleasing to God suffering anything
terrible, as, for instance, having fallen into sickness, or poverty, and any other the like, are
offended, not knowing that to those especially dear to God it belongeth to endure these
things; since Lazarus also was one of the friends of Christ, and was sick. This at least they
who sent said, “Behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.” But let us consider the passage from
the beginning. “A certain man,” It saith, “was sick, Lazarus of Bethany.” Not without a cause
nor by chance hath the writer mentioned whence Lazarus was, but for a reason which he
will afterwards tell us. At present let us keep to the passage before us. He also for our advantage
informeth us who were Lazarus’ sisters; and, moreover, what Mary had more (than the
other), going on to say, “It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment.” Here
some doubting1665 say, “How did the Lord endure that a woman should do this?” In the
first place then it is necessary to understand, that this is not the harlot mentioned in Matthew
( Matt. xxvi. 7 ), or the one in Luke ( Luke vii. 37 ), but a different person; they were harlots
full of many vices, but she was both grave and earnest; for she showed her earnestness about
the entertainment of Christ. The Evangelist also means to show, that the sisters too loved
Him, yet He allowed Lazarus to die. But why did they not, like the centurion and the nobleman,
leave their sick brother, and come to Christ, instead of sending? They were very confident
in Christ, and had towards Him a strong familiar feeling. Besides, they were weak
women, and oppressed with grief; for that they acted not in this way as thinking slightly of
Him, they afterwards showed. It is then clear, that this Mary was not the harlot. “But
wherefore,” saith some one, “did Christ admit that harlot?” That He might put away her
iniquity; that He might show His lovingkindness; that thou mightest learn that there is no
malady which prevaileth over His goodness. Look not therefore at this only, that He received
her, but consider the other point also, how He changed her. But, (to return,) why doth the
Evangelist relate this history to us? Or rather, what doth he desire to show us by saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 5.1666 “Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.”</p>
<p>That we should never be discontented or vexed if any sickness happen to good men,
and such as are dear to God.</p>

<pb n="447"/>
<p>Ver. 3.1667 “Behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.”</p>
<p>They desired to draw on Christ to pity, for they still gave heed to Him as to a man. This
is plain from what they say, “If thou hadst been here, he1668 had not died,” and from their
saying, not, “Behold, Lazarus is sick,” but “Behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.” What then
said Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God
might be glorified thereby.”</p>
<p>Observe how He again asserteth that His glory and the Father’s is One; for after saying
“of God,” He hath added, “that the Son of God might be glorified.”</p>
<p>“This sickness is not unto death.” Since He intended to tarry two days where He was,
He for the present sendeth away the messengers with this answer. Wherefore we must admire
Lazarus’ sisters, that after hearing that the sickness was “not unto death,” and yet seeing
him dead, they were not offended, although the event had been directly contrary. But even
so they came to Him,1669 and did not think that He had spoken falsely.</p>
<p>The expression “that” in this passage denotes not cause, but consequence; the sickness
happened from other causes, but He used it for the glory of God.</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “And having said this, He tarried two days.”1670</p>
<p>Wherefore tarried He? That Lazarus might breathe his last, and be buried; that none
might be able to assert that He restored him when not yet dead, saying that it was a lethargy,
a fainting, a fit,1671 but not death. On this account He tarried so long, that corruption began,
and they said, “He now stinketh.”</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “Then saith He to his disciples, Let us go into Judea.”1672</p>
<p>Why, when He never in other places told them beforehand where He was going, doth
He tell them here? They had been greatly terrified, and since they were in this way disposed,
He forewarneth them, that the suddenness might not trouble them. What then say the disciples?</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “The Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again?”</p>
<p>They therefore had feared for Him also, but for the more part rather for themselves; for
they were not yet perfect. So Thomas, shaking with fear, said, “Let us go, that we also may

die with Him” ( ver. 16 ), because Thomas was weaker and more unbelieving1673 than the
rest. But see how Jesus encourageth them by what He saith.</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “Are there not twelve hours of the day?”1674</p>
<p>He either saith this,1675 that “he who is conscious to himself of no evil, shall suffer
nothing dreadful; only he that doeth evil shall suffer, so that we need not fear, because we
have done nothing worthy of death”; or else that, “he who ‘seeth the light of this world’
is1676 in safety; and if he that seeth the light of this world is in safety, much more he that is
with Me, if he separate not himself from Me.” Having encouraged them by these words, He
addeth, that the cause of their going thither was pressing, and showeth them that they were
about to go not unto Jerusalem, but unto Bethany.</p>
<p>Ver. 11, 12. “Our friend Lazarus,” He saith, “sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him
out of sleep.”</p>
<p>That is, “I go not for the same purpose as before, again to reason and contend with the
Jews, but to awaken our friend.”</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Then said His disciples, Lord, if he sleep he shall do well.”</p>
<p>This they said not without a cause, but desiring to hinder the going thither. “Sayest
Thou,” asks one of them, “that he sleepeth? Then there is no urgent reason for going.” Yet
on this account He had said, “Our friend,” to show that the going there was necessary. When
therefore their disposition was somewhat reluctant, He said,</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 14.1677 “He is dead.”</p>
<p>The former word He spake, desiring to prove that He loved not boasting; but since they
understood not, He added, “He is dead.”</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “And I am glad for your sakes.”</p>
<p>Why “for your sakes”? “Because I have forewarned you of his death, not being there,
and because when I shall raise him again, there will be no suspicion of deceit.” Seest thou
how the disciples were yet imperfect in their disposition, and knew not His power as they
ought? and this was caused by interposing terrors, which troubled and disturbed their souls.
When He said, “He sleepeth,” He added, “I go to awake him”; but when He said, “He is
dead,” He added not, “I go to raise him”; for He would not foretell in words what He was
<note type="footnote">1673 al. “more cowardly.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1674 ver. 9, 10. “If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. But

about to establish certainly by works, everywhere teaching us not to be vainglorious, and
that we must not make promises without a cause. And if He did thus in the case of the centurion
when summoned, (for He said, “I will come and heal him Matt. viii. 7 ,) it was to
show the faith of the centurion that He said this. If any one ask, “How did the disciples
imagine sleep? How did they not understand that death was meant from His saying, ‘I go
to awake him?’ for it was folly if they expected that He would go fifteen stadia to awake
him”; we would reply, that they deemed this to be a dark saying, such as He often spake to
them.</p>
<p>Now they all feared the attacks of the Jews, but Thomas above the rest; wherefore also
he said,</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “Let us go, that we also may die with Him.”</p>
<p>Some say that he desired himself to die; but it is not so; the expression is rather one of
cowardice. Yet he was not rebuked, for Christ as yet supported his weakness, but afterwards
he became stronger than all, and invincible.1678 For the wonderful thing is this; that we see
one who was so weak before the Crucifixion, become after the Crucifixion, and after having
believed in the Resurrection, more zealous than any. So great was the power of Christ. The
very man who dared not go in company with Christ to Bethany, the same while not seeing
Christ ran1679 well nigh through the inhabited world, and dwelt in the midst of nations that
were full of murder, and desirous to kill him.</p>
<p>But if Bethany was “fifteen furlongs off,” which is two miles, how was Lazarus “dead
four days”?1680 Jesus tarried two days, on the day before those two one had come with the
message,1681 (on which same day Lazarus died,) then in the course of the fourth day He
arrived. He waited to be summoned, and came not uninvited on this account, that no one
might suspect what took place; nor did those women who were beloved by Him come
themselves, but others were sent.</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “Now Bethany was1682 about fifteen furlongs off.”</p>
<p>Not without cause doth he mention this, but desires to inform us that it was near, and
that it was probable on this account that many would be there. He therefore declaring this
adds,</p>

<pb n="450"/>
<p>But how should they comfort women beloved of Christ, when1685 they had agreed, that
if any should confess Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue? It was either because
of the grievous nature of the calamity, or that they respected them as of superior birth, or
else these who came were not the wicked sort, many at least even of them believed. The
Evangelist mentions these circumstances, to prove that Lazarus was really dead.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But why did not <del>Martha,</del> when she went to meet Christ,1686 take her sister with
her? She desired to meet with Him apart, and to tell Him what had taken place. But when
He had brought her to good hopes, she went and called Mary, who met Him while her grief
was yet at its height. Seest thou how fervent her love was? This is the Mary of whom He
said, “Mary hath chosen that good part.” ( Luke x. 42.) “How then,” saith one, “doth Martha
appear more zealous?” She was not more zealous, but it was because the other had not yet
been informed,1687 since Martha was the weaker. For even when she had heard such things
from Christ, she yet speaks in a groveling manner, “By this time he stinketh, for he hath
been dead four days.” ( Ver. 39.) But Mary, though she had heard nothing, uttered nothing
of the kind, but at once believing,1688 saith,1689</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”</p>
<p>See how great is the heavenly wisdom of the women, although their understanding be
weak. For when they saw Christ, they did not break out into mourning and wailing and
loud crying, as we do when we see any of those we know coming in upon our grief; but
straightway they reverence their Teacher. So then both these sisters believed in Christ, but
not in a right way; for they did not yet certainly know1690 either that He was God, or that
He did these things by His own power and authority; on both which points He taught them.
For they showed their ignorance of the former, by saying, “If thou hadst been here, our
brother had not died”; and of the latter, by saying,1691</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “Whatsoever1692 thou wilt ask of God, He will give it thee.”</p>
<p>As though they spoke of some virtuous and approved mortal. But see what Christ saith;</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “Thy brother shall rise again.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1685 Ben. has a different reading, with no variety of sense.</note>
<note type="footnote">1686 ver. 20. “Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary sat in the

<note type="footnote">1690 al. “they know not yet.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1691 al. and that they knew not, is manifest from their saying, “If Thou,” U+0026c., and from their adding, “Whatsoever,”

<note type="footnote">1692 “But I know that even now, whatsoever,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>

<pb n="451"/>
<p>He thus far refuteth the former saying, “Whatsoever thou wilt ask”; for He said not, “I
ask,” but what? “Thy brother shall rise again.” To have said, “Woman, thou still lookest below,
I need not the help of another, but do all of Myself,” would have been grievous, and a
stumblingblock in her way, but to say, “He shall rise again,” was the act of one who chose
a middle mode of speech.1693 And by means of that which follows, He alluded to the points
I have mentioned; for when Martha saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “I know that he shall rise again1694 in the last day,” to prove more clearly His
authority, He replieth,</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “I am the Resurrection and the Life.”</p>
<p>Showing that He needed no other to help Him, if so be that He Himself is the Life; since
if He needed another,1695 how could He be “the Resurrection and the Life”? Yet He did not
plainly state this, but merely hinted it. But when she saith again, “Whatsoever thou wilt
ask,” He replieth,</p>
<p>“He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.”</p>
<p>Showing that He is the Giver of good things, and that we must ask of Him.</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die.”</p>
<p>Observe how He leadeth her mind upward; for to raise Lazarus was not the only thing
sought; it was necessary that both she and they who were with her should learn the Resurrection.
Wherefore before the raising of the dead He teacheth heavenly wisdom by words.
But if He is “the Resurrection,” and “the Life,” He is not confined by place, but, present
everywhere, knoweth how to heal. If therefore they had said, as did the centurion, “Speak
the word, and my servant shall be healed” ( Matt. viii. 8 ), He would have done so; but since
they summoned Him to them, and begged Him to come, He condescendeth in order to
raise them from the humble opinion they had formed of Him, and cometh to the place. Still
while condescending, He showed that even when absent He had power to heal. On this ac-
count also He delayed, for the mercy would not have been appar ent as soon as it was given,
had there not been first an ill savor (from the corpse). But how did the woman know that
there was to be a Resurrection? They1696 had heard Christ say many things about the Resurrection,
yet still she now desired to see Him. And observe how she still lingers below; for
after hearing, “I am the Resurrection and the Life,” not even so did she say, “Raise him,”
but,</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1693 Ben. “fitly made the saying of a middle character.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1694 [“in the Resurrection”] N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1695 al. “other help,” al. “helper.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1696 al. “she.”</note>

<pb n="452"/>
<p>What is Christ’s reply? “He that believeth on Me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live,”1697 (here speaking of this death which is common to all.1698) “And whosoever liveth
and believeth on Me, shall never die” ( ver. 26 ), signifying that other death. “Since then I
am the Resurrection and the Life, be not thou troubled, though thy brother be already dead,
but believe, for this is not death.” For a while He comforted her on what had happened; and
gave her glimpses of hope, by saying, “He shall rise again,” and, “I am the Resurrection”;
and that having risen1699 again, though he should again die, he shall suffer no harm, so that
it needs not to fear this death. What He saith is of this kind: “Neither is this man dead, nor
shall ye die.” “Believest thou this?” She saith, “I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of
God.”</p>
<p>“Which should come into the world.”</p>
<p>The woman seems to me not to understand the saying; she was conscious that it was
some great thing, but did not perceive the whole meaning, so that when asked one thing,
she answered another. Yet for a while at least she had this gain, that she moderated her grief;
such was the power of the words of Christ. On this account Martha went forth first, and
Mary followed. For their affection to their Teacher did not allow them strongly to feel their
present sorrow; so that the minds of these women were truly wise as well as loving.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But in our days, among our other evils there is one malady very prevalent among
our women; they make a great show in their dirges and wailings, baring1700 their arms,
tearing their hair, making furrows down their cheeks. And this they do, some from grief,
others from ostentation and rivalry, others from wantonness; and they bare their arms, and
this too in the sight of men. Why doest thou, woman? Dost thou strip thyself in unseemly
sort, tell me, thou who art a member of Christ, in the midst of the market-place, when men
are present there? Dost thou pluck thy hair, and rend thy garments, and wail loudly, 1701
and join the dance, and keep throughout a resemblance to Bacchanalian women, and dost
thou not think that thou art offending God? What madness is this? Will not the heathen1702
laugh? Will they not deem our doctrines fables? They will say, “There is no resurrection—the
doctrines of the Christians are mockeries, trickery, and contrivance. For their women lament
as though there were nothing after this world; they give no heed to the words engraven in
their books; all those words are fictions, and these women show that they are so. Since had
they believed that he who hath died is not dead, but hath removed to a better life, they would

not have mourned him as no longer being, they would not have thus beaten themselves,1703
they would not have uttered such words as these, full of unbelief, ‘I shall never see thee more,
I shall never more regain thee,’ all their religion is a fable, and if the very chief of good things
is thus wholly disbelieved by them, much more the other things which are reverenced among
them.” The heathen1704 are not so womanish, among them many have practiced heavenly
wisdom; and a woman hearing that her child had fallen in battle, straightway asked, “And
in what state are the affairs of the city?” Another truly wise, when being garlanded1705 he
heard that his son had fallen for his country, took off the garland, and asked which of the
two; then when he had learnt which it was, immediately put the garland on again. Many
also gave their sons and their daughters for slaughter in honor of their evil deities; and
Lacedæmonian women exhort their sons either to bring back their shield safe from war, or
to be brought back dead upon it. Wherefore I am ashamed that the heathen show true wisdom
in these matters, and we act unseemly. Those who know nothing about the Resurrection
act the part of those who know; and those who know, the part of those who know not. And
ofttimes many do through shame of men what they do not for the sake of God. For women
of the higher class neither tear1706 their hair nor bare their arms; which very thing is a most
heavy charge against them, not because they do not strip themselves, but because they act
as they do not through piety, but that they may not be thought to disgrace themselves. Is
their shame stronger than grief, and the fear of God not stronger? And must not this deserve
severest censure? What the rich women do because of their riches, the poor ought to do
through fear of God; but at present it is quite the contrary; the rich act wisely through
vainglory, the poor through littleness of soul act unseemly. What is worse than this anomaly?
We do all for men, all for the things of earth. And these people utter words full of madness
and much ridicule. The Lord saith indeed, “Blessed are they that mourn” ( Matt. v. 4 ),
speaking of those who mourn1707 for their sins; and no one mourneth that kind of mourning,
nor careth for a lost soul; but this other we were not bidden to practice, and we practice
it.1708 “What then?” saith some one, “Is it possible being man not to weep?” No, neither do
I1709 forbid weeping, but I forbid the beating yourselves, the weeping immoderately.1710 I
am neither brutal nor cruel. I know that our nature asks1711 and seeks for its friends and

daily companions; it cannot but be grieved. As also Christ showed, for He wept over Lazarus.
So do thou; weep, but gently, but with decency, but with the fear of God. If so thou weepest,
thou dost so not as disbelieving the Resurrection, but as not enduring the separation. Since
even over those who are leaving us, and departing to foreign lands, we weep, yet we do this
not as despairing.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And so do thou weep, as if thou wert sending one on his way to another land. These
things I say, not as giving a rule of action, but as condescending (to human infirmity). For
if the dead man have been a sinner, and one who hath in many things offended God, it behooveth
to weep (or rather not to weep only, since that is of no avail to him, but to do what
one can to procure1712 some comfort for him by almsgivings and offerings;1713) but it behooveth
also to rejoice at this, that his wickedness hath been cut short. If he have been
righteous, it again1714 behooveth to be glad, that what is his is now placed in security, free
from the uncertainty of the future; if young, that he hath been quickly delivered from the
common evils of life; if old, that he hath departed after taking to satiety that which is held
desirable. But thou, neglecting to consider these things, incitest thy hand-maidens to act as
mourners, as if forsooth thou wert honoring the dead, when it is an act of extreme dishonor.
1715 For honor to the dead is not wailings and lamentings, but hymns and psalmodies
and an excellent life. The good man when he departeth, shall depart with angels, though no
man be near his remains; but the corrupt, though he have a city to attend his funeral, shall
be nothing profited. Wilt thou honor him who is gone? Honor him in another way, by almsdeeds,
by acts of beneficence and public service.1716 What avail the many lamentations?
And I have heard also another grievous thing, that many women attract lovers by their sad
cries, acquiring by the fervor of their wailings a reputation for affection to their husbands.
O devilish purpose! O Satanic invention!1717 How long are we but dust and ashes, how long
but blood and flesh? Look we up to heaven, take we thought of spiritual things.1718 How
shall we be able to rebuke the heathen,1719 how to exhort them, when we do such things?
How shall we dispute with them concerning the Resurrection? How about the rest of heavenly
wisdom? How shall we ourselves live without fear? Knowest not thou that of grief1720 cometh

death? for grief darkening1721 the seeing part of the soul not only hindereth it from perceiving
anything that it ought, but also worketh it great mischief. In one way then we offend God,
and advantage neither ourselves nor him who is gone; in the other we please God, and gain
honor among men. If we sink not down ourselves, He will soon remove the remains of our
despondency; if we are discontented, He permitteth us to be given up to grief. If we are
thankful, we shall not despond. “But how,” saith some one, “is it possible not to be grieved,
when one has lost a son or daughter or wife?” I say not, “not to grieve,” but “not to do so
immoderately.” For if we consider that God hath taken away, and that the husband or son
which we had was mortal, we shall soon receive comfort. To be discontented is the act of
those who seek for something higher than their nature. Thou wast born man, and mortal;
why then grievest thou that what is natural hath come to pass? Grievest thou that thou art
nourished by eating? Seekest thou to live without this?1722 Act thus also in the case of death,
and being mortal seek not as yet for immortality. Once for all this thing hath been appointed.
Grieve not therefore, nor play the mourner, but submit to laws laid on all alike. Grieve for
thy sins; this is good mourning, this is highest wisdom. Let us then mourn for this cause
continually, that we may obtain the joy which is there, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xi. 30, 31</p>
<p>“Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.
The Jews then which were with her,” and what follows.1723</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A great good is philosophy; the philosophy, I mean, which is with us. For what the
heathen have is words and fables only; nor have these fables anything truly wise1724 in them;
since everything among those men is done for the sake of reputation. A great good then is
true wisdom, and even here1725 returns to us a recompense. For he that despises wealth,
from this at once reaps advantage,1726 being delivered from cares which are superfluous
and unprofitable;1727 and he that tramples upon glory from this at once receives his reward,
being the slave of none, but free with the real freedom; and he that desires heavenly things
hence receives his recompense, regarding present things as nothing, and being easily superior
to every grief. Behold, for example, how this woman by practicing true wisdom even
here received her reward. For when all were sitting by her as she mourned and lamented,
she did not wait that the Master should come to her, nor did she maintain what might have
seemed her due, nor was she restrained by her sorrow, (for, in addition to the other
wretchedness, mourning women have this malady, that they wish to be made much of on
account of their case,) but she was not at all so affected; as soon as she heard, she quickly
came to Him.1728 “Jesus was not yet come into the town.”1729 He proceeded somewhat
slowly, that He might not seem to fling Himself upon the miracle, but rather to be1730 entreated
by them. At least, it is either with an intention of implying this that the Evangelist
has said the, “riseth up quickly,” or else he showeth that she ran so as to anticipate Christ’s
arrival. She came not alone, but drawing after her the Jews that were in the house. Very
wisely did her sister call1731 her secretly, so as not to disturb those who had come together,
and not mention the cause either; for assuredly many would have gone back, but now as
<note type="footnote">1723 ver. 31. “The Jews then which were with her, when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out,

though she were going to weep, all followed her. By these means again it is proved1732 that
Lazarus was dead.</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “And she fell at His feet.”1733</p>
<p>She is more ardent than her sister. She regarded not the multitude, nor the suspicion
which they had concerning Him, for there were many of His enemies, who said, “Could not
this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
have died?” ( ver. 37 ); but cast out all mortal things in the presence of her Master, and was
given up to one thing only, the honor of that Master. And what saith she?</p>
<p>“Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”</p>
<p>What doth Christ? He converseth not at all with her for the present, nor saith to her
what He said to her sister, (for a great multitude was by, and this was no fit time for such
words,) He only acteth measurably and condescendeth; and to prove His human nature,
weepeth in silence, and deferreth the miracle for the present. For since that miracle was a
great one, and such as He seldom wrought, and since many were to believe1734 by means
of it, lest to work it without their presence should prove a stumbling-block to the multitude,
and so they should gain nothing by its greatness, in order that He might not lose the
quarry,1735 He draweth to Him many witnesses by His condescension, and showeth proof
of1736 His human nature. He weepeth, and is troubled; for grief is wont to stir up the feelings.
Then rebuking those feelings, (for He “groaned1737 in spirit” meaneth, “restrained His
trouble,”) He asked,</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “Where have ye laid him?”</p>
<p>So that the question might not be attended with lamentation. But why doth He ask?
Because He desired not to cast Himself on (the miracle), but to learn all from them, to do
all at their invitation, so as to free the miracle from any suspicion.</p>
<p>“They say unto Him, Come and see.”</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “Jesus wept.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that He had not as yet shown any sign of the raising, and goeth not as if to
raise Lazarus, but as if to weep? For the Jews show that He seemed to them to be going to
bewail, not to raise him; at least they said,</p>
<note type="footnote">1732 al. “perhaps it is proved.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1733 Ver. 32, 33. “Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying
unto Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and
the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and troubled Himself.”</note>

<p>Ver. 36, 37. “Behold how he loved him! And some of them said, Could not this man,
which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”</p>
<p>Not even amid calamities did they relax their wickedness. Yet what He was about to do
was a thing far more wonderful; for to drive away death when it hath come and conquered,
is far more than to stay it when coming on. They therefore slander Him by those very points
through which they ought to have marveled at His power. They allow for the time that He
opened the eyes of the blind, and when they ought to have admired Him on account of that
miracle, they, by means of this latter case, cast a slur upon it, as though it had not even taken
place. And not from this only are they shown to be all corrupt, but because when He had
not yet come, nor exhibited any action, they prevent Him with their accusations without
waiting the end of the matter. Seest thou how corrupt was their judgment?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> He cometh then to the tomb; and again1738 rebuketh His feelings. Why doth the
Evangelist carefully in several places mention that “He wept,” and that, “He groaned”?1739
That thou mayest learn that He had of a truth put on our nature. For when this Evangelist
is remarkable for uttering great things concerning Christ more than the others, in matters
relating to the body, here he also speaketh much more humbly than they.1740 For instance,
concerning His death he hath said nothing of the kind; the other Evangelists declare that
He was exceedingly sorrowful, that He was in an agony; but John, on the contrary, saith,
that He even cast the officers backwards. So that he hath made up here what is omitted there,
by mentioning His grief. When speaking of His death, Christ saith, “I have power to lay
down My life” ( c. x. 18 ), and then He uttereth no lowly word; therefore at the Passion
they1741 attribute to Him much that is human, to show the reality of the Dispensation. And
Matthew proves this by the Agony, the trouble, the trembling,1742 and the sweat; but John
by His sorrow. For had He not been of our nature, He would not once and again have been
mastered by grief. What did Jesus? He made no defense with regard to their charges; for
why should He silence by words those who were soon to be silenced by deeds? a means less
annoying, and more adapted to shame them.</p>
<p>Ver. 39. “He saith, Take ye away the stone.”</p>
<p>Why did not He when at a distance summon Lazarus, and place him before their eyes?
Or rather, why did He not cause him to arise while the stone yet lay on the grave? For He
who was able by His voice to move a corpse, and to show it again endowed with life, would

<pb n="459"/>
much more by that same voice have been able to move a stone; He who empowered by His
voice one bound and entangled in the grave-clothes to walk, would much more have been
able to move a stone; why then did He not so? In order to make them witnesses of the miracle;
that they might not say as they did in the case of the blind man, “It is he,” “It is not he.” For
their hands1743 and their coming to the tomb testified that it was indeed he. If they had not
come, they might have deemed that they saw a vision, or one man in place of another. But
now the coming to the place, the raising the stone, the charge given them to loose the dead
man bound in grave-clothes from his bands; the fact that the friends who bore him from
the tomb, knew from the grave-clothes1744 that it was he; that his sisters were not left behind;
that one of them said, “He now stinketh, for he hath been dead four days”; all these things,
I say, were sufficient to silence the ill-disposed, as they were made witnesses of the miracle.
On this account He biddeth them take away the stone from the tomb, to show that He
raiseth the man. On this account also He asketh, “Where have ye laid him?” that they who
said, “Come and see,” and who conducted Him, might not be able to say that He had raised
another person; that their voice and their hands might bear witness, (their voice by saying,
“Come and see,” their hands by lifting the stone, and loosing the grave-clothes,) as well as
their eyes and ears, (the one by hearing His voice, the other by seeing Lazarus come forth,)
and their smell also by perceiving the ill-odor, for Martha said, “He now stinketh, for he
hath been dead four days.”</p>
<p>Therefore I said with good reason, that the woman did not at all understand Christ’s
words, “Though he were dead, yet shall he live.” At least observe, that she speaketh as though
the thing were impossible on account of the time which had intervened. For indeed it was
a strange thing to raise a corpse which had been dead four days, and was corrupt. To the
disciples Jesus said, “That the Son of Man may be glorified,” referring to Himself; but to the
woman, “Thou shalt see the glory of God,” speaking of the Father. Seest thou that the
weakness of the hearers is the cause of the difference of the words? He therefore remindeth
her of what He had spoken unto her, well nigh rebuking her, as being forgetful. Yet He did
not wish at present to confound the spectators, wherefore He saith,1745</p>
<p>Ver. 40. “Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory
of God?”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> A great blessing truly is faith, great, and one which makes great those who hold it
rightly with (good) living.1746 By this men (are enabled) to do the things of God in His1747

name. And well did Christ say,1748 “If ye have faith ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove,
and it shall remove” ( Matt. xvii. 20 ); and again, “He that believeth on Me, the works that
I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do.” ( c. xiv. 12.) What meaneth
He by “greater”? Those which the disciples are seen after this to work. For even the shadow
of Peter raised a dead man; and so the power of Christ was the more proclaimed. Since it
was not so wonderful that He while alive should work miracles, as that when He was dead
others should be enabled to work in His name greater than He wrought. This was an indisputable
proof of the Resurrection; nor if (that Resurrection) had been seen by all, would it
have been equally believed. For men might have said that it was an appearance, but one who
saw that by His name alone greater miracles were wrought than when He conversed with
men, could not disbelieve unless he were very senseless. A great blessing then is faith when
it arises from glowing feelings, great love,1749 and a fervent soul; it makes us truly wise, it
hides our human meanness, and leaving reasonings beneath, it philosophizes about things
in heaven; or rather what the wisdom of men cannot discover,1750 it abundantly comprehends
and succeeds in. Let us then cling to this, and not commit to reasonings1751 what concerns
ourselves. For tell me, why have not the Greeks been able to find out anything? Did they
not know all the wisdom of the heathen?1752 Why then could they not prevail against fishermen
and tentmakers, and unlearned persons? Was it not because the one committed all
to argument, the others to faith? and so these last were victorious over Plato and Pythagoras,
in short, over all that had gone astray; and they surpass those whose lives had been worn
out in1753 astrology and geometry, mathematics and arithmetic, and who had been thoroughly
instructed in1754 every sort of learning, and1755 were as much superior to them as
true and real philosophers are superior to those who are by nature foolish and out of their
senses.1756 For observe, these men asserted that the soul was immortal, or rather, they did
not merely assert this, but persuaded others of it. The Greeks, on the contrary, did not at
first know what manner of thing the soul was, and when they had found out, and had distinguished
it from the body, they were again in the same case, the one asserting that it was

incorporeal, the other that it was corporeal and was dissolved with the body. Concerning
heaven again, the one said that it had life and was a god, but the fishermen both taught and
persuaded that it was the work and device1757 of God. Now that the Greeks should use
reasonings is nothing wonderful, but that those who seem to be believers, that “they” should
be found carnal,1758 this is what may justly be lamented.1759 And on this account they have
gone astray, some saying that they know God as He knoweth Himself, a thing which not
even any of those Greeks have dared to assert; others that God cannot beget without passion,
not even allowing Him any superiority over men;1760 others again, that a righteous life and
exact1761 conversation avail nothing. But it is not the time to refute these things now. [4.]
Yet that a right faith availeth nothing if the life be corrupt, both Christ and Paul declare,
having taken the more care for this latter part; Christ when He teacheth,1762 “Not every one
that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven” ( Matt. vii. 21 ); and
again, “Many will say unto Me in that day, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy Name?
And I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity”1763
( Matt. xxii. 23 ); (for they who take not heed to themselves, easily slip away1764 into
wickedness, even though they have a right faith;) and Paul, when in his letter to the Hebrews
he thus speaks and exhorts them; “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which
no man shall see the Lord.” ( Heb. xii. 14.) By “holiness,” meaning chastity, so that it behooved
each to be content with his own wife, and not have to do with1765 any other woman; for it
is impossible that one not so contented should be saved; he must assuredly perish though
he have ten thousand right actions, since with fornication it is impossible to enter into the
kingdom of heaven. Or rather, this is henceforth1766 not fornication but adultery; for as a
woman who is bound to a man, if she come together with1767 another man, then hath
committed adultery, so he that is bound to a woman, if he have another, hath committed
adultery. Such an one shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven, but shall fall into the pit.

Hear what Christ saith concerning these,1768 “Their worm shall not die,1769 and the fire
shall not be quenched.” ( Mark ix. 44.) For he can have no pardon, who after (possessing)
a wife, and the comfort of a wife, then acts shamelessly towards another woman; since this
is henceforth wantonness.1770 And if the many abstain even from their wives when it be a
season of fast or prayer, how great a fire doth he heap up for himself who is not even content
with his wife, but mingleth with another; and if it is not permitted one who has put away
and cast out his own wife to mingle with another, (for this is adultery,) how great evil doth
he commit who, while his wife is in his house, brings in another. Let no one then allow this
malady to dwell in his soul; let him tear it up by the root. He doth not so much wrong his
wife as himself. For so grievous and unpardonable is this offense, that if a woman separate
herself from a husband which is an idolater without his consent, God punisheth her; but if
she separate herself from a fornicator, not so. Seest thou how great an evil this is? “If,” It
saith, “any faithful woman have1771 a husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to
dwell with her, let her not leave him.” ( 1 Cor. vii. 13.) Not so concerning a harlot; but what?
“If any man1772 put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, he causeth her to
commit adultery.” ( Matt. v. 32.) For if the coming together maketh one body, he who
cometh together with a harlot must needs become one body with her. How then shall the
modest woman, being a member of Christ, receive such an one, or how shall she join to
herself the member of an harlot. And observe the excess of the one (fornication) over the
other (idolatry). The woman who dwelleth with an unbeliever is not impure; (“for,” It saith,
“the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife”— 1 Cor. vi. 15 ;) not so with the harlot;
but what? “Shall I then make the members of Christ the members of an harlot?” In the one
case sanctification remains, and is not removed though the unbeliever dwelleth with his
wife; but in the other case it departeth. A dreadful, a dreadful thing is fornication, and an
agent for 1773 everlasting punishment; and even in this world it brings with it ten thousand
woes. The man so guilty is forced to lead a life of anxiety and toil; he is nothing better off
than those who are under punishment, creeping1774 into another man’s house with fear
and much trembling, suspecting all alike1775 both slave and free. Wherefore I exhort you

to be1776 freed from this malady, and if you obey1777 not, step not on the sacred
threshold.1778 Sheep that are covered with the scab, and full of disease, may not herd with
those that are in health; we must drive them from the fold until they get rid of the malady.
We have been made members of Christ; let us not, I entreat, become members of an harlot.
This place is not a brothel but a church; if then thou hast the members of an harlot, stand
not in the church, lest thou insult the place. If there were no hell, if there were no punishment,
yet, after those contracts, those marriage torches, the lawful bed, the procreation of children,
the intercourse, how couldest thou bear to join1779 thyself to another? How is it that thou
art not ashamed nor blushest? Knowest thou not that they who after the death of their own
wife, introduce another into their own house, are blamed by many? yet this action hath no
penalty attached to it: but thou bringest in another while thy wife is yet alive. What lustfulness
is this! Learn what hath been spoken concerning such men, “Their worm,” It saith, “shall
not die, and the fire shall not be quenched.” ( Mark ix. 44.) Shudder at the threat, dread the
vengeance. The pleasure here is not so great as the punishment there, but may it not came
to pass that any one (here) become liable to that punishment, but that exercising holiness
they may see Christ, and obtain the promised good things, which may we all enjoy, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xi. 41, 42</p>
<p>“Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me; and I knew
that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people which stand by, I said it.” And
what follows.</p>
<p><del>1.</del> What I have often said, I will now say, that Christ looketh not so much to His own
honor as to our salvation; not how He may utter some sublime saying, but how something
able to draw us to Him. On which account His sublime and mighty sayings are few, and
those also hidden, but the humble and lowly are many, and abound1780 through His discourses.
For since by these men were the rather brought over, in these He continueth; and
He doth not on the one hand utter these1781 universally, lest the men that should come after
should receive damage, nor, on the other hand, doth He entirely withhold those,1782 lest
the men of that time should be offended. Since they who have passed from lowmindedness
unto perfection,1783 will be able from even a single sublime doctrine to discern the whole,
but those who were ever lowminded, unless they had often heard these lowly sayings,1784
would not have come to Him1785 at all. In fact, even after so many such sayings they do not
remain firm, but even stone and persecute Him, and try to kill Him, and call Him blasphemer.
And when He maketh Himself equal with God, they say, “This man blasphemeth” ( Matt.
ix. 3 ); and when He saith, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” ( c. x. 20 ), they moreover call Him
a demoniac. So when He saith that the man who heareth His words is stronger than death,
or, “I am in the Father and the Father in Me” ( c. viii. 51 ), they leave Him; and again, they
are offended when He saith that He came down from heaven. ( c. vi. 33, 60.) If now they
could not bear these sayings, though seldom uttered, scarcely, had His discourse been always
sublime, had it been of this texture, would they have given heed to Him? When therefore
He saith, “As the Father commanded Me, so I speak”1786 ( c. xiv. 31 ); and, “I am not
come1787 of Myself” ( c. vii. 28 ), then they believe. That they did believe then is clear, from
the Evangelist signifying this besides, and saying, “As He spake these words, many believed

on Him.” ( c. v. 30.) If then lowly speaking drew men to1788 faith, and high speaking scared
them away,1789 must it not be a mark of extreme folly not to see at a glance how to reckon1790
the sole reason of those lowly sayings, namely, that they were uttered because of the hearers.
Since in another place when He had desired to say some high thing, He withheld it, adding
this reason, and saying, “Lest we should offend them, cast a hook into the sea.” ( Matt. xvii.
27.) Which also He doth here; for after saying, “I know that Thou hearest Me always,” He
addeth, “but because of the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they might believe.”
Are these words ours? Is this a human conjecture? When then a man will not endure
to be persuaded by what is written, that1791 they were offended at sublime things, how,
when he heareth Christ saying that He spake in a lowly manner that they might not be offended,
how, after that, shall he suspect that the mean sayings belonged to His nature, not
to His condescension?1792 So in another place, when a voice came down from heaven, He
said, “This voice came not because of Me, but for your sakes.” ( c. xii. 30.) He who is exalted
may be allowed to speak lowly things of himself, but it is not lawful for the humble to utter
concerning himself anything grand or sublime. For the former ariseth from condescension,
and has for its cause the weakness of the hearers; or rather (it has for its cause) the leading
them to1793 humblemindedness, and His being clothed in flesh, and the teaching the hearers
to say nothing great concerning themselves, and His being deemed an enemy of God, and
not being believed to have come from God, His being suspected of breaking the Law, and
the fact that the hearers looked on Him with an evil eye, and were ill disposed towards Him,
because He said that He was equal to God.1794 But that a lowly man should say any great
thing of Himself, hath no cause either reasonable or unreasonable;1795 it can only be folly,
impudence, and unpardonable boldness. Wherefore then doth Christ speak humbly, being
of that ineffable and great Substance? For the reasons mentioned, and that He might not be

deemed unbegotten; for Paul seems to have feared some such thing as this; wherefore he
saith, “Except Him who did put all things under Him.” ( 1 Cor. xv. 27.) This it is impious
even to think of. Since if being less than Him who begat Him, and of a different Substance,
He had been deemed equal, would He not have used every means that this might not be
thought? But now He doth the contrary, saying, “If I do not the works of Him that sent
Me,1796 believe Me not.” ( c. x. 37.) Indeed His saying, that “I am in the Father and the
Father in Me” ( c. xiv. 10 ), intimateth to us the equality. It would have behooved, if He had
been inferior, to refute this opinion with much vehemence, and not at all to have said, “I
am in the Father and the Father in me” ( c. x. 30 ), or that, “We are One,” or that, “He that
hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.” ( c. xiv. 9.) Thus also, when His discourse was concerning
power, He said, “I and the Father are One”; and when His discourse was concerning authority,
He said again, “For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He wilt” ( c. v. 21 ); which it would be impossible that He should do were
He of a different substance; or even allowing that it were possible, yet it would not have behooved
to say this, lest they should suspect that the substance was one and the same. Since
if in order that they may not suppose Him to be an enemy of God, He often even uttereth
words unsuited to Him, much more should He then have done so; but now, His saying,
“That they should honor the Son even as they honor the Father” ( c. v. 23 ); His saying, “The
works which He doeth, I do also” ( c. v. 19 ); His saying that He is “the Resurrection, and
the Life, and the Light of the world” ( c. xi. 25; c. viii. 12 ), are the expressions of One making
Himself equal to Him who begat Him, and confirming the suspicion which they entertained.
Seest thou1797 how He maketh this speech and defense, to show that He broke not the Law,
and that He not only doth not remove, but even confirmeth the opinion of His equality with
the Father? So also when they said, “Thou blasphemest, because thou makest thyself God”
( c. x. 33 ), from equality of works He established this thing.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And why say I that1798 the Son did this, when the Father also who took not1799 the
flesh doeth the same thing? For He also endured that many lowly things should be said
concerning Him for the salvation of the hearers. For the, “Adam, where art thou?” ( Gen.
iii. 9 ), and, “That I may know whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
it” ( Gen. xviii. 21 ); and, “Now I know that thou fearest God” ( Gen. xxii. 12 ); and, “If they
will hear” ( Ezek. iii. 11 ); and, “If they will understand” ( Deut. v. 29 ); and, “Who shall
give the heart of this people to be so?” and the expression, “There is none like unto Thee
among the gods, O Lord” ( Ps. lxxx. 29 ); these and many other like sentences in the Old

Testament, if a man should pick them out, he will find to be unworthy of the dignity of God.
In the case of Ahab it is said, “Who shall entice Ahab for Me?” ( 2 Chron. xviii. 19.) And
the continually preferring Himself to the gods of the heathen in the way of comparison, all
these things are unworthy of God. Yet in another way they are made worthy of Him, for He
is so kind, that for our salvation He careth not for expressions which become His dignity.
Indeed, the becoming man is unworthy of Him, and the taking the form of a servant, and
the speaking humble words, and the being clothed in 1800 humble (garments), unworthy if
one looks to His dignity, but worthy if one consider the unspeakable riches1801 of His lovingkindness.
And there is another cause of the humility of His words. What is that? It is
that they knew and confessed1802 the Father, but Him they knew not. Wherefore He continually
betaketh Himself to the Father as being confessed by them, because He Himself was
not as yet deemed worthy of credit; not on account of any inferiority of His own, but because
of the folly and infirmity of the hearers. On this account He prayeth, and saith, “Father, I
thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.” For if He quickeneth whom He will, and quickeneth
in like manner as doth the Father, wherefore doth He call upon Him?</p>
<p>But it is time now to go through the passage from the beginning.1803 “Then they took
up the stone where the dead man lay. And Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said, Father, I thank
Thee that Thou hast heard Me. And I knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of
the people that stand by I said it, that they might believe that Thou hast sent Me.” Let us
then ask the heretic, Did He receive an impulse1804 from the prayer, and so raise the dead
man? How then did He work other miracles without prayer? saying, “Thou evil spirit, I
charge thee, come out of him” ( Mark ix. 25 ); and, “I will, be thou clean” ( Mark i. 41 ); and,
“Arise, take up thy bed” ( c. v. 8 ); and, “Thy sins be forgiven thee” ( Matt. ix. 2 ); and to the
sea, “Peace, be still.” ( Mark iv. 39.) In short, what hath He more than the Apostles, if so be
that He also worketh by1805 prayer? Or rather I should say, that neither did they work all
with prayer, but often they wrought without prayer, calling upon the Name of Jesus. Now,
if His Name had such great power, how could He have needed prayer? Had He needed
prayer, His Name would not have availed. When He wholly made man, what manner of
prayer did He need? was there not then great equality of honor? “Let Us make,” It saith,
“man.” ( Gen. i. 26 .) What could be greater sign of weakness, if He needed prayer? But let
us see what the prayer was; “I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.” Who now ever prayed
<note type="footnote">1800 al. “enduring mean things.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1801 al. “greatness.”</note>

<note type="footnote">1805 al. “upon.”</note>

<pb n="468"/>
in this manner? Before uttering any prayer, He saith, “I thank Thee,” showing that He needed
not prayer.1806 “And I knew that Thou hearest Me always.” This He said not as though He
Himself were powerless, but to show that His will and the Father’s is one. But why did He
assume the form of prayer? Hear, not me, but Himself, saying, “For the sake of the people
which stand by, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.” He said not, "That they may
believe that I am inferior, that I have need of an impulse from above, that without prayer I
cannot do anything; but, “That Thou hast sent Me.” For all these things the prayer declareth,
if we take it simply. He said not, “Thou hast sent me weak, acknowledging servitude, and
doing nothing of Myself”; but dismissing all these things, that thou mayest have no such
suspicions, He putteth the real cause of the prayer, “That they may not deem Me an enemy
of God; that they may not say, He is not of God, that I may show them that the work hath
been done according to Thy will.” All but saying, “Had I been an enemy of God, what is
done would not have succeeded,” but the, “Thou heardest Me,” is said in the case of friends
and equals. “And I knew that Thou hearest Me always,” that is, “in order that My will be
done I need no prayer, except to persuade men that to Thee and Me belongeth one will.”
“Why then prayest Thou?” For the sake of the weak and grosser1807 sort.</p>
<p>Ver. 43. “And when He had thus spoken, He cried with a loud voice.”</p>
<p>Why said He not, “In the name of My Father come forth”? Or why said He not, “Father,
raise him up”? Why did he omit all these expressions, and after assuming the attitude of
one praying, show by His actions His independent authority? Because this also was a part
of His wisdom, to show condescension by words, but by His deeds, power. For since they
had nothing else to charge Him with except that He was not of God, and since in this way
they deceived many, He on this account most abundantly proveth this very point by what
He saith, and in the way that their infirmity required. For it was in His power by other means
to show at once His agreement with the Father and His own dignity, but the multitude could
not ascend so far. And He saith,</p>
<p>“Lazarus, come forth.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> This is that of which He spake, “The hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.” ( c. v. 28.) For, that thou mightest not
think that He received the power of working from another, He taught thee this before, and
gave proof by deeds, and said not, Arise, but, “Come forth,” conversing with the dead man
as though living. What can be equal to this authority? And if He doth it not by His own
strength, what shall He have more than the Apostles, who say, “Why look ye so earnestly
on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?” ( Acts iii.
12.) For if, not working by His own power, He did not add what the Apostles said concerning
<note type="footnote">1806 al. some mss. add, “for Thou doest all things, whatsoever I will, He saith.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1807 al. “meaner.”</note>

<pb n="469"/>
themselves, they will in a manner be more truly wise than He, because they refused the glory.
And1808 in another place, “Why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions as
you.” ( Acts xiv. 15.) The Apostles since they did nothing of themselves, spoke in this way
to persuade men of this; but He when the like opinion was formed concerning Him, would
He not have removed the suspicion, if at least He did not act by His own authority? Who
would assert this? But in truth Christ doeth the contrary, when He saith, 1809 “Because of
the people which stand by I said it, that they might believe”; so that had they believed, there
would have been no need of prayer. Now if prayer were not beneath His dignity, why should
He account them the cause of His praying? Why said He not, “I do it in order that they may
believe that I am not equal to Thee”; for He ought on account of the suspicion to have come
to this point. When He was suspected of breaking the Law, He used the very expression,
even when they had not said anything, “Think not that I am come to destroy the Law” (
Matt. v. 17 ); but in this place He establisheth their suspicion. In fact, what need was there
at all of going such a round, and of using such dark sayings? It had been enough to say, “I
am not equal,” and to be rid of the matter. “But what,” saith some one, “did He not say that,
I do not My own will?” Even this He did in a covert way, and one suited to their infirmity,
and from the same cause through which the prayer was made. But what meaneth “That
Thou hast heard Me”? It meaneth,1810 “That there is nothing on My part opposed to Thee.”
As then the, “That Thou hast heard Me,” is not the saying of one declaring, that of Himself
He had not the power, (for were this the case, it would be not only impotence but ignorance,
if before praying He did not know that God would grant the prayer; and if He knew not,
how was it that He said, “I go that I may awake him,” instead of, “I go to pray My Father to
awake him?”) As then this expression is a sign, not of weakness, but of identity of will, so
also is the, “Thou hearest Me always.” We must then either say this, or else that it was addressed
to their suspicions. If now He was neither ignorant nor weak, it is clear that He
uttereth these lowly words, that thou mayest be persuaded by their very excess, and mayest
be compelled to confess, that they suit not His dignity, but are from condescension. What
then say the enemies of truth? “He spake not those words, Thou hast heard me,” saith some
one, “to the infirmity of the hearers, but in order to show a superiority.” Yet this was not to
show a superiority,1811 but to humble Himself greatly, and to show Himself as having
nothing more than man. For to pray is not proper to God, nor to the sharer of the Throne.
Seest thou then that He came to this1812 from no other cause than their unbelief? Observe
at least that the action beareth witness to His authority.</p>

<p>“He called, and the dead man came forth wrapped.”1813 Then that the matter might
not seem to be an appearance, (for his coming forth bound did not seem to be less marvelous
than his resurrection,) Jesus commanded to loose him, in order that having touched and
having been near him, they might see that it was really he. And He saith,</p>
<p>“Let him go.”</p>
<p>Seest thou His freedom from boastfulness? He doth not lead him on, nor bid him go
about1814 with Him, lest He should seem to any to be showing him; so well knew He how
to observe moderation.</p>
<p>When the sign had been wrought, some wondered, others went and told it to the Pharisees.
1815 What then did they? When they ought to have been astonished and to have admired
Him, they took counsel to kill Him who had raised the dead. What folly! They thought to
give up to death Him who had overcome death in the bodies of others.</p>
<p>Ver. 47. “And they said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.”</p>

have deemed Him a man.</p>

themselves would be in danger on suspicion of establishing a kingdom. “For if,” saith one
of them, “the Romans learn1819 that this Man is leading the multitudes, they will suspect
us,1820 and will come and destroy our city.” Wherefore, tell me? Did He teach revolt? Did
He not permit you to give tribute to Cæsar? Did not ye wish to make Him a king, and He
fly from you? Did He not follow1821 a mean and unpretending1822 life, having neither house

nor anything else of the kind? They therefore said this, not from any such expectation, but
from malice. Yet it so fell out contrary to their expectation, and the Romans took their nation
and city when they had slain Christ. For the things done by Him were beyond all suspicion.
For He who healed the sick, and taught the most excellent way of life, and commanded men
to obey their rulers, was not establishing but undoing a tyranny. “But,” saith some one, “we
conjecture from former (impostors).” But they taught revolt, He the contrary. Seest thou
that the words were but a pretense? For what action of the kind did He exhibit? Did He lead
about with Him1823 pompous1824 guards? had He a train of chariots? Did He not seek the
deserts? But they, that they may not seem to be speaking from their own ill feeling,1825 say
that all the city is in danger, that the common weal is being plotted against, and that they
have to fear the worst. These were not the causes of your captivity, but things contrary to
them; both of this last, and of the Babylonish, and of that under Antiochus which followed:
it was not that there were worshipers among you, but that there were among you those who
did unjustly, and excited God to wrath, this caused you to be given up into bondage. But
such a thing is envy, allowing men to see nothing which they ought to see, when it has once
for all blinded the soul. Did He not teach men to be meek? Did He not bid them when
smitten on the right cheek to turn the other also? Did He not bid them when injured to bear
it? to show greater readi ness to endure evil, than others have to inflict it? Are these, tell
me, the signs of one establishing a tyranny, and not rather of one pulling a tyranny down?</p>

( Mic. vii. 1, 2.) It is our part too henceforth to mourn, or rather we have need to say this
every day. We profit nothing by our prayers, nothing by our advice and exhortation, it remaineth
therefore that we weep. Thus did Christ; after having many times exhorted those
in Jerusalem, when they profited nothing, He wept at their hardness.1829 This also do the
Prophets, and this let us do now. Henceforth is the season for mourning and tears and
wailing; it is seasonable for us also to say now, “Call for the mourning women, and send for
the cunning women, that they may cry aloud” ( Jer. ix. 17 ); perhaps thus we shall be able
to cast out the malady of those who build splendid houses, of those who surround themselves
with lands gotten by rapine. It is seasonable to mourn; but do ye take part with me in the
mourning, ye who have been stripped and injured, by your mournings bring down my tears.
But while mourning we will mourn, not for ourselves but for them; they have not injured
you, but they have destroyed themselves; for you have the Kingdom of heaven in return for
the injustice done you, they hell in return for their gain. On this account it is better to be
injured than to injure. Let us bewail them with a lamentation not of man’s making, 1830 but
that from the Holy Scriptures with which the Prophets also wailed. With Isaiah let us wail
bitterly, and say, “Woe, they that add house to house, that lay field to field, that they may
take somewhat from their neighbor; will ye dwell alone upon the earth? Great houses and
fair, and there shall be no inhabitants in them.” ( Isa. v. 8, 9.)</p>
<p>Let us mourn with Nahum, and say with him, “Woe to him that buildeth his house on
high.” (Perhaps Jer. xxii. 13.) Or rather let us mourn for them as Christ mourned for those
of old. “Woe to you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.” ( Luke vi. 24.) Let
us, I beseech you, not cease thus lamenting, and if it be not unseemly, let us even beat our
breasts for the carelessness of our brethren. Let us not weep for him who is already dead,
but let us weep for the rapacious man, the grasping, the covetous, the insatiable. Why should
we mourn for the dead, in whose case it is impossible henceforth to effect anything? Let us
mourn for these who are capable even of change. But while we are lamenting, perhaps they
will laugh. Even this is a worthy cause for lamentation, that they laugh when they ought to
mourn. For had they been at all affected by our sorrows, it would have behooved us to cease
from sorrowing on account of their promise of amendment; but since they are of an insensible
disposition, let us continue to weep, not merely for the rich, but for the lovers of money,
the greedy, the rapacious. Wealth is not an evil thing, (for we may use it rightly when we
spend it upon those who have need,) but greediness is an evil, and it prepares1831 deathless
punishments. Let us then bewail them; perhaps there will be some amendment; or even if
they who have fallen in do not escape, others at least will not fall into the danger, but will

guard against it. May it come to pass that both they may be freed from their malady, and
that none of us may ever fall into it, that we all may in common obtain the promised goods,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“And one of them, Caiaphas, being the High Priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know
nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient that one man should die for the people,
and that the whole nation perish not,” U+0026c. </p>
<p><del>1.</del> “The heathen are stuck fast in the destruction which they made; in the trap which
they hid is their foot taken.” ( Ps. ix. 15 , LXX.) This hath been the case with the Jews. They
said that they would kill Jesus, lest the Romans should come and take away their place and
nation; and when they had killed Him, these things happened unto them, and when they
had done that by doing which they thought to escape, they yet did not escape. He who was
slain is in Heaven, and they who slew have for their portion hell. Yet they did not consider
these things; but what? “They desired,” It saith, “from that day forth to kill Him” ( ver. 53
), for they said, “The Romans will come, and will take away our nation; and a certain one
of them, Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said,” (being more shameless than the rest,)
“Ye know nothing.” What the others made matter of doubt, and put forth in the way of deliberation,
this man cried aloud, shamelessly, openly, audaciously. For what saith he? “Ye
know nothing, nor consider that it is expedient that one man should die, and that the whole
nation perish not.”</p>
<p>Ver. 51. “And this spake he not of himself, but being High Priest he prophesied.”1832</p>
<p>Seest thou how great is the force of the High Priest’s authority? or, since he had in any
wise been deemed worthy of the High Priesthood, although unworthy thereof, he prophesied,
not knowing what he said; and the grace merely made use of his mouth, but touched not
his accursed heart. Indeed many others have foretold things to come, although unworthy
to do so, as Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Balaam; and the reason of all is evident. But what
he saith is of this kind. “Ye still sit quiet, ye give heed but carelessly to this matter, and know
not how to despise one man’s safety for the sake of the community.” See how great is the
power of the Spirit; from an evil imagination It was able to bring forth words full of marvelous
prophecy. The Evangelist calleth the Gentiles “children of God,” from what was about to
be: as also Christ Himself saith, “Other sheep I have” ( c. x. 16 ), so calling them from what
should afterwards come to pass.</p>
<p>But what is, “being High Priest that year”? This matter as well as the rest had become
corrupt; for from the time that offices became matters of purchase, they were no longer

priests for the whole period of their lives, but for a year. Notwithstanding, even in this state
of things the Spirit was still present. But when they lifted up their hands against Christ, then
It left them, and removed to the Apostles. This the rending of the veil declared, and the
voice of Christ which said, “Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” ( Matt. xxiii. 38.)
And Josephus, who lived a short time after, saith, that certain Angels who yet remained with
them, (to see) if they would alter their ways, left them.1833 While the vineyard stood, all
things1834 went on; but when they had slain the Heir, no longer so, but they perished. And
God having taken it from the Jews, as a glorious garment from an unprofitable son, gave it
to right-minded servants of the Gentiles, leaving the others desolate and naked. It was,
moreover, no small thing that even an enemy should prophesy this. This might draw over
others also. For in respect of his1835 will, matters fell out contrariwise, since,1836 when He
died, the faithful were on this account delivered from the punishment to come. What
meaneth, “That He might gather together those near and those afar off” ( ver. 52 )? He made
them one Body. The dweller in Rome deemeth the Indians a member of himself. What is
equal to this “gathering together”? And the Head of all is Christ.</p>
<p>Ver. 53. “From that day forth the Jews1837 took counsel to put Him to death.”</p>
<p>And, in truth, had sought to do so before; for the Evangelist saith, “Therefore the Jews
sought to kill Him” ( c. v. 18 ); and, “Why seek ye to kill Me?” ( c. vii. 19.) But then they only
sought, now they ratified their determination, and treated the action as their business.</p>

dwelt in Ephratah, near the wilderness, and there He tarried with His disciples. How thinkest
thou that those disciples were confounded when they beheld Him saving Himself after the
manner of a man? After this no man followed Him. For since the Feast was nigh, all were
running to Jerusalem; but they,1839 at a time when all others were rejoicing and holding

solemn assembly, hide themselves, and are in danger. Yet still they tarried with Him. For
they hid themselves in Galilee, at the time of the Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles; and
after this again during the Feast, they only of all were with their Master in flight and concealment,
manifesting their good will to Him. Hence Luke recordeth that He said, “I abode with
you in temptations”; 1840 and this He said, showing that they were strengthened by His influence.</p>
<p>Ver. 55.1842 “And many went up from the country to purify themselves.”</p>
<p>Ver. 57. “And the High Priests and Pharisees had commanded that they should lay
hands on Him.”</p>
<p>A marvelous purification, with a murderous will, with homicidal intentions, and
bloodstained hands!</p>
<p>Ver. 56. “And they said, Think ye that he will not come to the feast?”</p>
<p>By means of the Passover they plotted against Him, and made the time of feasting a
time of murder, that is, He there would fall into their hands, because the season summoned
Him. What impiety! When they needed greater carefulness, and to forgive those who had
been taken for the worst offenses, then they attempted to ensnare One who had done no
wrong. Yet by acting thus they had already not only profited nothing, but become ridiculous.
For this end coming among them continually He escapeth, and restraineth them when they
take counsel1843 to kill Him, and maketh them to be in perplexity, desiring to prick them
by the display of His power; that when they took Him, they might know that what had been
done was done, not by their power, but by His permission. For not even at that time could
they take Him, and this though Bethany was near; and when they did take Him, He cast
them backwards.</p>
<p>Ch. xii. ver. 1, 2. “Then six days before the Passover He came to Bethany, where Lazarus
was, and feasted with them; and Martha served, but Lazarus sat at meat.”1844</p>
<p>This was a proof of the genuineness of his resurrection, that after many days he both
lived and ate. “And Martha ministered”; whence it is clear that the meal was in her house,

for they received Jesus as loving and beloved. Some, however, say, that it took place in the
house of another. Mary did not minister, for she was a disciple. Here again she acted in the
more spiritual manner. For she did not minister as being invited, nor did she afford her
services to all alike. But she directeth1845 the honor to Him alone, and approacheth Him
not as a man, but as a God. On this account she poured out the ointment,1846 and wiped
(His feet) with the hairs of her head, which was the action of one who did not entertain the
same opinion concerning Him as did others; yet Judas rebuked her, under the pretense
forsooth of carefulness. What then saith Christ? “She hath done a good work for My burying.”
1847 But why did He not expose the disciple in the case of the woman, nor say to him
what the Evangelist hath declared, that on account of his own thieving he rebuked her? In
His abundant longsuffering He wished to bring him to a better mind.1848 For because He
knew that he was a traitor, He from the beginning often rebuked him, saying, “Not all believe,”
and, “One of you is a devil.” ( c. vi. 64.) He showed them that He knew him to be a
traitor, yet He did not openly rebuke him, but bare with him, desiring to recall him. How
then saith another Evangelist, that all the disciples used these words? ( Matt. xxvi. 70.) All
used them, and so did he, but the others not with like purpose. And if any one ask why He
put the bag of the poor in the hands of a thief, and made him steward who was a lover of
money, we would reply, that God knoweth the secret reason; but that, if we may say something
by conjecture, it was that He might cut off from him all excuse. For he could not say
that he did this thing1849 from love of money, (for he had in the bag sufficient to allay his
desire,) but from excessive wickedness which Christ wished to restrain, using much condescension
towards him. Wherefore He did not even rebuke him as stealing, although aware
of it, stopping the way to his wicked desire, and taking from him all excuse. “Let her alone,”
He saith, “for against the day of My burying hath she done1850 this.” Again, He maketh
mention of the traitor in speaking of His burial. But him the reproof reacheth not, nor doth
the expression soften1851 him, though sufficient to inspire him with pity: as if He had said,
<note type="footnote">1845 περιίστησι</note>
<note type="footnote">1846 Ver. 3–6. “Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and anointed the feet of
Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair: and the whole house was filled with the odor of the ointment. Then saith
one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray Him, Why was not this ointment sold
for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he
was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.”</note>

“I am burdensome and troublesome, but wait a little while, and I shall depart.” This too he
intended in saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “But Me ye have not always.”1852</p>
<p>But none of these things turned back1853 that savage madman; yet in truth Jesus said
and did far more than this, He washed his feet that night, made him a sharer in the table
and the salt, a thing which is wont to restrain even the souls of robbers, and spake other
words, enough to melt a stone, and this, not long before, but on the very day, in order that
not even time might cause it to be forgotten. But he stood out against all.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> For a dreadful, a dreadful thing is the love of money, it disables both eyes and ears,
and makes men worse to deal with than a wild beast, allowing a man to consider neither
conscience, nor friendship, nor fellowship, nor the salvation of his own soul, but having
withdrawn them at once from all these things, like some harsh mistress,1854 it makes those
captured by it its slaves. And the dreadful part of so bitter a slavery is, that it persuades them
even to be grateful for it; and the more they become enslaved, the more doth their pleasure
increase; and in this way especially the malady becomes incurable, in this way the monster
becomes hard to conquer. This made Gehazi a leper instead of a disciple and a prophet; this
destroyed Ananias and her with him;1855 this made Judas a traitor; this corrupted the rulers
of the Jews, who received gifts, and became the partners of thieves. This hath brought in ten
thousand wars, filling the ways with blood, the cities with wailings and lamentations. This
hath made meals to become impure, and tables accursed, and hath filled food with transgression;
therefore hath Paul called it “idolatry”: ( Col. iii. 5 ), and not even so hath he deterred
men from it. And why calleth he it “idolatry”? Many possess wealth, and dare not use it, but
consecrate it, handing it down untouched, not daring to touch it, as though it were some
dedicated thing. And if at any time they are forced to do so, they feel as though they had
done something unlawful. Besides, as the Greek carefully tends his graven image,1856 so
thou entrusteth thy gold to doors and bars; providing a chest instead of a shrine, and laying
it up in silver vessels. But thou dost not bow down to it as he to the image? Yet thou showest
all kind of attention to it.</p>
<p>Again, he would rather give up his eyes or his life than his graven image. So also would
those who love gold. “But,” saith one, “I worship not the gold.” Neither doth he, he saith,
worship the image, but the devil that dwelleth in it; and in like manner thou, though thou
worship not the gold, yet thou worshipest that devil who springeth on thy soul, from the
<note type="footnote">1852 “For the poor always ye have with you, but Me,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1853 or, “bent.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1854 τυραννίς</note>

<note type="footnote">1856 al. “as one the graven image of stone, so thou,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="479"/>
sight of the gold and thy lust for it. For more grievous than an evil spirit is the lust of moneyloving,
and many obey it more than others do idols. For these last in many things disobey,
but in this case they yield everything, and whatever it telleth them to do, they obey. What
saith it? “Be at war with all,” it saith, “at enmity with all, know not nature, despise God,
sacrifice to me thyself,” and in all they obey. To the graven images they sacrifice oxen and
sheep, but avarice saith, Sacrifice to me thine own soul, and the man obeyeth. Seest thou
what kind of altars it hath, what kind of sacrifices it receiveth? The covetous shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God, but not even so do they fear. ( 1 Cor. vi. 10.) Yet this desire is1857
weaker than all the others, it is not inborn, nor natural, (for then it would have been placed
in us at the beginning;) but there was no gold at the beginning, and no man desired gold.
But if you will, I will tell you whence the mischief entered. By each man’s envying the one
before him, men have increased the disease, and he who has gotten in advance provokes
him who had no desire. For when men see splendid houses, and extensive lands, and troops
of slaves, and silver vessels, and great heaps of apparel, they use every means to outdo them;
so that the first set of men are causes of the second, and these of those who come after. Now
if they would be sober-minded, they would not be teachers (of evil) to others; yet neither
have these any excuse. For others there are also who despise riches. “And who,” saith one,
“despises them?” For the terrible thing is, that, because wickedness is so general, this seems
to have become impossible, and it is not even believed that one can act aright. Shall I then
mention many both in cities and in the mountains? And what would it avail? Ye will not
from their example become better. Besides, our discourse hath not now this purpose, that
you should empty yourselves of your substance: I would that ye could do so; however, since
the burden is too heavy for you, I constrain you not; only I advise you that you desire not
what belongs to others, that you impart somewhat of your own. Many such we shall find,
contented with what belongs to them, taking care of their own, and living on honest labor.
Why do we not rival and imitate these? Let us think of those who have gone before us. Do
not their possessions stand, preserving nothing but their name; such an one’s bath, such an
one’s suburban seat and lodging? Do we not, when we behold them, straightway groan,
when we consider what toil he endured, what rapine committed? and now he is nowhere
seen, but others luxuriate in his possessions, men whom he never expected would do so,
perhaps even his enemies, while he is suffering extremest punishment. These things await
us also; for we shall certainly die, and shall certainly have to submit to the same end. How
much wrath, tell me, how much expense, how many enmities these men incurred; and what
the gain? Deathless punishment, and the having no consolation; and the being not only
while alive, but when gone, accused by all? What? when we see the images of the many laid
up in their houses, shall we not weep the more? Of a truth well said the Prophet, “Verily,
<note type="footnote">1857 i.e. in itself.</note>

<pb n="480"/>
every man living disquieteth himself in vain” ( Ps. xxxix. 11 , LXX.); for anxiety about such
things is indeed disquiet, disquiet and superfluous trouble. But it is not so in the everlasting
mansions, not so in those tabernacles. Here one hath labored, and another enjoys; but there
each shall possess his own labors, and shall receive a manifold reward. Let us press forward
to get that possession, there let us prepare for ourselves houses, that we may rest in Christ
Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>John xii. 8</p>
<p>“Much people of the Jews therefore knew that He was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake
only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom He had raised from the dead.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> As wealth is wont to hurl into destruction1858 those who are not heedful, so also is
power; the first leads into covetousness, the second into pride. See, for instance, how the
subject multitude of the Jews is sound, and their rulers corrupt; for that the first of these
believed Christ, the Evangelists continually assert, saying, that “many of the multitude believed
on Him” ( c. vii. 31, 48 ); but they who were of the rulers, believed not. And they
themselves say, not the multitude,1859 “Hath any of the rulers believed on Him?” But what
saith one? “The multitude who know not God1860 are accursed” ( c. vii. 49 ); the believers
they call accursed, and themselves the slayers, wise. In this place also, having beheld the
miracle, the many believed; but the rulers were not contented with their own evil deeds,1861
they also attempted to kill Lazarus.1862 Suppose they did attempt to slay Christ because He
broke the Sabbath, because He made Himself equal to the Father, and because of the Romans
whom ye allege, yet what charge had they against Lazarus, that they sought to kill him? Is
the having received a benefit a crime? Seest thou how murderous is their will? Yet He had
worked many miracles; but none exasperated them so much as this one, not the paralytic,
not the blind. For this was more wonderful in its nature, and was wrought after many others,
and it was a strange thing to see one, who had been dead four days, walking and speaking.
An honorable action, in truth, for the feast, to mix up the solemn assembly with murders.
Besides, in the one case1863 they thought to charge Him concerning the Sabbath, and so to
draw away the multitudes; but here, since they had no fault to find with Him, they make
the attempt on the man who had been healed. For here they could not even say that He was
opposed to the Father, since the prayer stopped their mouths. Since then the charge which
they continually brought against Him was removed, and the miracle was evident, they hasten
to murder. So that they would have done the same in the case of the blind man, had it not
been in their power to find fault respecting the Sabbath. Besides, that man was of no note,

<pb n="482"/>
and they cast him out of the temple; but Lazarus was a person of distinction, as is clear, since
many came to comfort his sisters; and the miracle was done in the sight of all, and most
marvelously. On which account all ran to see. This then stung them, that while the feast
was going on, all should leave it and go to Bethany. They set their hand therefore to kill him,
and thought they were not1864 daring anything, so murderous were they. On this account
the1865 Law at its commencement opens with this, “Thou shalt not kill” ( Ex. xx. 13 ); and
the Prophet brings this charge against them, “Their hands are full of blood.” ( Isa. i. 15.)</p>
<p>But how, after not walking openly in Jewry, and retiring into the wilderness, doth He
again enter openly?1866 Having quenched their anger by retiring, He cometh to them when
they were stilled. Moreover, the multitude which went before and which followed after was
sufficient to cast them into an agony; for no sign so much attracted the people as that of
Lazarus. And another Evangelist saith, that they strewed their garments under His feet1867
( Matt. xxi. 8 ), and that “the whole city was moved” ( Matt. xxi. 10 ); with so great honor
did He enter. And this He did, figuring one prophecy and fulfilling another; and the same
act was the beginning of the one and the end of the other. For the, “Rejoice, for thy King
cometh unto thee meek” ( Zech. ix. 9 ), belonged to Him as fulfilling a prophecy, but the
sitting upon an ass was the act of one prefiguring a future event, that He was about to have
the impure race of the Gentiles subject to Him.</p>
<p>But how say the others, that He sent disciples, and said, “Loose the ass and the colt” (
Matt. xxi. 2 ), while John saith nothing of the kind, but that “having found a young ass, He
sat upon it”? Because it is likely that both circumstances took place, and that He after the
ass was loosed, while the disciples were bringing it, found (the colt), and sat upon it. And
they took the small branches of palm trees and olives, and strewed their garments in the
way, showing that they now had a higher opinion concerning Him than of a Prophet, and
said,</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Hosannah, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that this most choked them, the persuasion which all men had that He was
not an enemy of God? And this most divided the people, His saying that He came from the
Father. But what meaneth,</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “Rejoice greatly,1868 daughter of Zion”?</p>

<p>Because all their kings had for the most part been an unjust and covetous kind of men,
and had given them over to their enemies, and had perverted the people, and made them
subject to their foes; “Be of good courage,” It saith, “this is not such an one, but meek and
gentle”; as is shown by the ass, for He entered not with an army in His train, but having an
ass alone.</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “But this,” saith the Evangelist, “the disciples knew not, that it was written of
Him.”1869</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Seest thou that they were ignorant on most points, because He did not reveal to
them? For when He said, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up” ( c. ii.
19 ), neither then did the disciples understand.1870 And another Evangelist saith, that “the
saying was hid from them” ( Luke xviii. 34 ), and they knew not that He should rise from
the dead. Now this was with reason concealed from them, (wherefore another Evangelist
saith, that as they heard it from time to time, they grieved and were dejected,1871 and this
because they understood not the saying concerning the Resurrection,) it was with reason
concealed, as being too high for them: but why was not the matter of the ass revealed to
them? Because this was a great thing also. But observe the wisdom of the Evangelist, how
he is not ashamed to parade their former ignorance. That it was written they knew, that it
was written of Him they knew not. For it would have offended them if He being a King were
about to suffer such things, and be so betrayed. Besides, they could not at once have taken
in the knowledge of the Kingdom of which He spake; for another Evangelist saith, that they
thought the words were spoken of a kingdom of this world. ( Matt. xx. 21.)</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “But the multitude bare witness that He had raised Lazarus.”1872</p>
<p>For so many would not have been suddenly changed, unless they had believed in the
miracle.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail
nothing? behold, the world is gone after Him.”</p>
<p>Now this seems to me to be said by those who felt rightly, but had not courage to speak
boldly, and who then would restrain the others by pointing to the result, as though they
were attempting impossibilities. Here again they call the multitude “the world.” For Scripture
is wont to call by the name “world” both the creation, and those who live in wickedness; the

one, when It saith, “Who bringeth out His world1873 by number” ( Isa. xl. 26 ); the other

it is necessary to know exactly, that we may not through the signification of words afford a
handle to the heretics.</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “And there were certain of the Greeks that came up to worship at the Feast.”</p>
<p>Being now near to become proselytes, they were at1875 the Feast. When therefore the
report concerning Him was imparted to them, they say,</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “We would see Jesus.”1876</p>
<p>Philip gives place to Andrew as being before him, and communicates the matter to him.
But neither doth he at once act with authority; for he had heard that saying, “Go not into
the way of the Gentiles” ( Matt. x. 5 ): therefore having communicated with the disciple, he
refers the matter to his Master. For they both spoke to Him. But what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 23, 24. “The hour is come, that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily,
I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.”</p>
<p>What is, “The hour is come”? He had said, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles,” (thus
cutting away all excuse of ignorance from the Jews,) and had restrained the disciples. When
therefore the Jews continued disobedient, and the others desired to come to Him, “Now,”
saith He, “it is time to proceed to My Passion, since all things are fulfilled. For if we were to
continue to wait for those who are disobedient and not admit these who even desire to come,
this would be unbefitting our tender care.” Since then He was about to allow the disciples
to go to the Gentiles after the Crucifixion, and beheld them springing on before, He said,
“It is time to proceed to the Cross.” For He would not allow them to go sooner, that it might
be for a testimony unto them.1877 Until that by their deeds the Jews rejected Him, until they
crucified Him, He said not, “Go and make disciples of all nations” ( Matt. xxviii. 19 ), but,
“Go not into the way of the Gentiles” ( Matt. x. 5 ), and, “I am not sent but unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel” ( Matt xv. 24 ), and, “It is not meet to take the children’s bread
and give it unto dogs.” ( Matt. xv. 26.) But when they hated Him, and so hated as to kill
Him, it was superfluous to persevere while they repulsed Him. For they refused Him, saying,
“We have no king but Cæsar.” ( c. xix. 15.) So that at length He left them, when they had
left Him. Therefore He saith, “How often would I have gathered your children together,
and ye would not?” ( Matt. xxiii. 37.)</p>

<p>What is, “Except a grain of corn fall into the ground and die”? He speaketh of the Cross,
for that they might not be confounded at seeing, that just when Greeks also came to Him,
then He was slain, He saith to them, “This very thing specially causeth them to come, and
shall increase the preaching of Me.” Then since He could not so well persuade them by
words, He goeth about to prove this from actual experience, telling them that this is the case
with corn; it beareth the more fruit when it hath died. “Now,” saith He, “if this be the case
with seeds, much more with Me.” But the disciples understood not what was spoken.
Wherefore the Evangelist continually putteth this,1878 as making excuse for their flight afterwards.
This same argument Paul also hath raised when speaking of the Resurrection.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> What sort of excuse then will they have who disbelieve the Resurrection, when the
action is practiced each day, in seeds, in plants, and in the case of our own generation? for
first it is necessary that the seed die, and that then the generation take place. But, in short,
when God doeth anything, reasonings are of no use; for how did He make us out of those
things that were not? This I say to Christians, who assert that they believe the Scriptures;
but I shall also say something else drawn from human reasonings. Of men some live in vice,
others in virtue; and of those who live in vice, many have attained to extreme old age in
prosperity, many of the virtuous after enduring the contrary. When then shall each receive
his deserts? At what season? “Yea,” saith some one, “but there is no resurrection of the
body.” They hear not Paul, saying, “This corruptible must put on incorruption.” ( 1 Cor.
xv. 53 .) He speaks not of the soul, for the soul is not corrupted; moreover, “resurrection”
is said of that which fell, and that which fell was the body. But why wilt thou have it that
there is no resurrection of the body? Is it not possible with God? But this it were utter folly
to say. Is it unseemly? Why is it unseemly, that the corruptible which shared the toil and
death, should share also the crowns? For were it unseemly,1879 it would not have been created
at the beginning, Christ would not have taken the flesh again. But to show that He took it
again and raised it up, hear what He saith: “Reach1880 hither thy fingers” ( c. xx. 27 ); and,
“Behold, a spirit hath not bones and sinews.”1881 ( Luke xxiv. 39.) But why did He raise
Lazarus again, if it would have been better to rise without a body? Why doth He this, classing
it as a miracle and a benefit? Why did He give nourishment at all? Be not therefore deceived
by the heretics, beloved: for there is a Resurrection and there is a Judgment, but they deny
these things, who desire not to give account of their actions. For this Resurrection must be
such as was that of Christ, for He was the first fruits, the first born of the dead. But if the
Resurrection is this,1882 a purifying of the soul, a deliverance from sin, and if Christ sinned

not, how did He rise again? And how have we been delivered from the curse, if so be that
He also sinned? And now saith He, “The prince of this world cometh, and had nothing in
Me”? ( c. xiv. 30.) They are the words of One declaring His sinlessness. According to them
therefore He either did not rise again; or that He might rise, 1883 He sinned before His Resurrection.
But He both rose again, and did no sin. Therefore He rose in the Body, and these
wicked doctrines are nothing else than the offspring of vainglory. Let us then fly this malady.
For, It is saith, “evil communications corrupt good manners.” ( 1 Cor. xv. 33.) These are
not the doctrines of the Apostles; Marcion and Valentius have newly invented them. Let us
then flee them, beloved, for a pure life profits nothing when doctrines are corrupt; as on the
other hand neither do sound doctrines, if the life be corrupt. The heathen were the parents
of these notions, and those heretics reared them, having received them from Gentile philosophers,
asserting that matter is uncreated, and many such like things. As then they asserted
that there could be no Artificer1884 unless there were some uncreated subject matter, so
also they disallowed the Resurrection. But let us not heed them, as knowing that the power
of God is all sufficient.1885 Let us not heed them. To you I say this; for we will not decline
the battle with them. But the man who is unarmed and naked, though he fall among the
weak, though he be the stronger, will easily be vanquished. Had you given heed to the
Scriptures, had you sharpened yourselves each day, I would not have advised you to flee the
combat with them, but would have counseled you to grapple with them; for strong is truth.
But since you know not how to use the Scriptures, I fear the struggle, lest they take you unarmed
and cast you down. For there is nothing, there is nothing weaker than those who are
bereft of the aid of the Spirit. If these heretics employ the wisdom of the Gentiles, we must
not admire, but laugh at them, because they employ foolish teachers. For those men were
not able to find out anything sound, either concerning God or the creation, and things which
the widow among us is acquainted with, Pythagoras did not yet know, but said that the soul
becomes a bush, or a fish, or a dog. To these, tell me, ought you to give heed? And how
could it be reasonable to do so? They are great men in their district,1886 grow beautiful curls,
and are enfolded in cloaks; thus far goes their philosophy; but if you look within there is
dust and ashes and nothing sound, but “their throat is an open sepulcher” ( Ps. v. 9 ), having
all things full of impurity and corruption,1887 and all their doctrines (full) of worms. For
instance, the first of them said that water was God, his successor fire, another one air, and1888

they descended to things corporeal; ought we then, tell me, to admire these, who never even
had the thought of the incorporeal God? and if they did ever gain it afterwards, it was after
conversing in Egypt with our people. But, that we bring not upon you much confusion, let
us here close our discourse. For should we begin to set before you their doctrine, and what
they have said about God, what about matter, what about the soul, what about the body,
much ridicule will follow. And they will not even require to be accused by us, for they have
attacked each other; and he who wrote against us the book concerning matter, made away
with himself. Therefore that we may not vainly delay you, nor wind together1889 a labyrinth
of words, leaving these things we will bid you keep fast hold of the listening to the Holy
Scriptures, and not fight with1890 words to no purpose; as also Paul exhorteth Timothy ( 2
Tim. ii. 14 ), filled though he was with much wisdom, and possessing the power of miracles.
Let us now obey him, and leaving trifling; let us hold fast to real works, I mean to brotherlykindness
and hospitality; and let us make much account of alms-giving, that we may obtain
the promised good things, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for endless ages.1891 Amen.</p>

<p>John xii. 25, 26</p>
<p>“He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto
life eternal. If any man serve Me, let him follow Me.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Sweet is the present life, and full of much pleasure, yet not to all, but to those who
are riveted to it. Since, if any one look to heaven and see the beauteous things there, he will
soon despise this life, and make no account of it. Just as the beauty of an object is admired
while none more beautiful is seen, but when a better appears, the former is despised. If then
we would choose to look to that beauty, and observe the splendor of the kingdom there, we
should soon free ourselves from our present chains; for a kind of chain it is, this sympathy
with present things. And hear what Christ saith to bring us in to this, “He that loveth his
life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal; if any
man serve Me let him follow Me”; and, “Where I am, there is1892 My servant also.” The
words seem like a riddle, yet they are not so, but are full of much wisdom. But how shall
“he that loveth his life, lose it”? When he doeth its unseemly desires, when he gratifies it
where he ought not. Wherefore one exhorteth us, saying, “Walk not in the desires of thy
soul” ( Ecclus. xviii. 30 ); for so wilt thou destroy it since it leadeth away from the path
leading to virtue; just as, on the contrary, “he that hateth it in this world, shall save it.” But
what meaneth, “He that hateth it”? He who yields not to it when it commands what is pernicious.
And He said not, “he that yieldeth not to it,” but, “He that hateth it”; for as we
cannot endure even to hear the voice of those we hate, nor to look upon them with pleasure,
so from the soul also we must turn away with vehemence, when it commands things contrary
to what is pleasing to God. For since He was now about to say much to them concerning
death, His own death, and saw that they were dejected1893 and desponding, He spake very
strongly, saying, “What say I? If ye bear not valiantly My death? Nay, if ye die not yourselves,
ye will gain nothing.” Observe also how He softens the discourse. It was a very grievous and
sad thing to be told, that the man who loves life should die. And why speak I of old times,
when even now we shall find many gladly enduring to suffer anything. in order to enjoy the
present life, and this too when they are persuaded concerning things to come; who when
they behold buildings, and works of art, and contrivances, weep, uttering the reflection,
“How many things man inventeth, and yet becometh dust! So great is the longing after this
present life.” To undo these bonds then, Christ saith, “He that hateth his soul in this world,
<note type="footnote">1892 “shall be,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1893 al. “looking down,” or, “disdainful.”</note>

<pb n="489"/>
shall keep it unto life eternal.” For that thou mayest know that He spake as exhorting them,
and dissipating their fear, hear what comes next.</p>
<p>“If any man serve Me, let him follow Me.”</p>
<p>Speaking of death, and requiring the following which is by works. For certainly he that
serveth must follow him who is served. And observe at what time He said these things to
them; not when they were persecuted, but when they were confident; when they thought
they were in safety on account of the honor and attention of the many, when they might
rouse themselves and hear, “Let him take up his cross, and follow Me” ( Matt. xvi. 24 ); that
is, “Be ever,”1894 He saith, “prepared against dangers, against death, against your departure
hence.” Then after He had spoken what was hard to bear, He putteth also the prize. And of
what kind was this? The following Him, and being where He is; showing that Resurrection
shall succeed death. For, saith He,</p>
<p>“Where I am, there is1895 My servant also.”</p>
<p>But where is Christ? In heaven. Let us therefore even before the Resurrection remove
thither in soul and mind.</p>
<p>“If any man serve Me, the Father shall love1896 him.”</p>
<p>Why said He not, “I”? Because they did not as yet hold a right opinion concerning Him,
but held a higher opinion of the Father. For how could they imagine anything great concerning
Him, who did not even know that He was to rise again? Wherefore He said to the sons
of Zebedee, “It is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by
my Father” ( Mark x. 40 ), yet He it is that judgeth. But in this passage He also establisheth
His genuine sonship.1897 For as the servants of His own Son, so will the Father receive them.</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour.”</p>
<p>“But surely this is not1898 the expression of one urging them to go even to death.” Nay,
it is that of one greatly so urging them. For lest they should say, that “He being exempt from
mortal pains easily philosophizes on death, and exhorts us being himself in no danger,” He
showeth, that although feeling its agony,1899 on account of its profitableness He declineth
it not. But these things belong to the Dispensation, not the Godhead. Wherefore He saith,
“Now is My soul troubled”; since if this be not the case, What connection hath that which
was spoken, and His saying, “Father, save Me from this hour”? And so troubled, that He
<note type="footnote">1894 lit. “in battle array.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1895 “shall be,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1896 “honor,” N.T.</note>

<note type="footnote">1898 al. “is no longer.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1899 ἀ γωνιῶν αὐτὸν</note>

<pb n="490"/>
even sought deliverance from death, if at least it were possible to escape. These were the
infirmities of His human nature.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “But,” He saith, “I have not what to say, when asking for deliverance.”</p>
<p>“For for this cause came I unto this hour.”</p>
<p>As though He had said, “Though we be confounded, though we be troubled, let us not
fly from death, since even now I though troubled do not speak of flying; for it behooveth to
bear what is coming on. I say not, Deliver Me from this hour,” but what?</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “Father, glorify Thy Name.”</p>
<p>“Although My trouble urges Me to say this,1900 yet I say the opposite, ‘Glorify Thy
Name,’ that is, Lead Me henceforth to the Cross”; which greatly shows His humanity, and
a nature unwilling to die, but clinging to the present life, proving that He was not exempt
from human feelings. For as it is no blame to be hungry, or to sleep, so neither is it to desire
the present life; and Christ indeed had a body pure from sin, yet not free from natural wants,
for then it would not have been a body. By these words also He taught something else. Of
what kind is that? That if ever we be in agony and dread, we even then start not back from
that which is set before us; and by saying,1901 “Glorify Thy Name” He showeth that He dieth
for the truth calling the action, “glory to God.” And this fell out after the Crucifixion. The
world was about to be converted, to acknowledge the Name of God, and to serve Him, not
the Name of the Father only, but also that of the Son; yet still as to this He is silent.</p>
<p>“There came therefore a Voice from Heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it
again.”</p>
<p>When had He “glorified it”? By what had been done before; and “I will glorify it again”
after the Cross. What then said Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 30.1902 “This Voice came not because of Me, but for your sakes.”</p>
<p>They thought that it thundered, or that an Angel spake to Him. And how did they think
this? Was not the voice clear and distinct? It was, but it quickly flew away from them as being
of the grosser sort, carnal and slothful. And some of them caught the sound only,1903 others
knew that the voice was articulate, but what it meant, knew not. What saith Christ? “This
Voice came not because of Me, but for your sakes.” Why said He this? He said it, setting
Himself against what they continually asserted, that He was not of God. For He who was
glorified by God, how was He not from that God whose name by Him was glorified? indeed
for this purpose the Voice came. Wherefore He saith Himself, “This Voice came not because

<note type="footnote">1901 Ben. omits “and by saying.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1902 Ver. 29 omitted. “The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered; others said,

<pb n="491"/>
of Me, but for your sakes,” “not that I may learn by it anything of which I am ignorant, (for
I know all that belongeth to the Father,) but for your sakes.” For when they said, “An Angel
hath spoken unto Him,” or “It hath thundered,” and gave not heed to Him, He saith, “it
was for your sakes,” that even so ye might be led to enquire what the words meant. But they,
being excited, did not even so enquire, though they heard that the matter related to them.
For to one who knew not wherefore it was uttered, the Voice naturally appeared indistinct.
“The Voice came for your sakes.” Seest thou that these lowly circumstances take place on
their account, not as though the Son needeth help?</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast
down.”1904</p>
<p>What connection hath this with, “I have glorified, and will glorify”? Much, and closely
harmonizing. For when God saith, “I will glorify,” He showeth the manner of the glorifying.
What is it? That one1905 should be cast down. But what is, “the judgment of this world”? It
is as though He said, “there shall be a tribunal and a retribution.” How and in what way?
“He1906 slew the first man, having found him guilty of sin, (for ‘by sin death entered’—
Rom. v. 12 ;) but in Me this he found not. Why then did he spring upon Me and give Me
over to death? Why did he put into the mind of Judas to destroy Me?” (Tell me not that it
was God’s dispensation, for this belongeth not to the devil, but His wisdom; for the present
let the disposition of that evil one be enquired into.) “How then is the world judged in Me?”
It shall be said, as if a court of justice were sitting, to Satan, “Well, thou hast slain all men,
because thou didst find them guilty of sin. But why didst thou slay Christ? Is it not clear
that thou didst it wrongfully?” Therefore in Him the whole world shall be avenged. But, that
this may be still more clear, I will make it plain by an exam ple. Suppose there is some cruel
tyrant, bringing ten thousand evils on all those who fall into his hands. If such a one engaging
with a king, or a king’s son, slay him unjustly, his death will have power to get revenge for
the others also. Suppose there is one who demands payment of his debtors, that he beats
them and casts them into prison; then from the same recklessness that he leads to the same
dungeon one who owes him nothing: such a man shall suffer punishment for what he hath
done to the others. For that one shall destroy him.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> So also it is in the case of the Son; for of those things which the devil hath done
against us, of these shall the penalty be required by means of what he hath dared against
Christ. And to show that He implieth this, hear what He saith; “Now shall the prince of this
world be cast down,” “by My Death.”</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1904 “cast out,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1905 i.e. the prince of this world.</note>
<note type="footnote">1906 i.e. Satan.</note>

<pb n="492"/>
<p>That is, “even those of the Gentiles.” And that no one may ask, “How shall he be cast
down, if he is stronger even than Thou art?” He saith, “He is not stronger; how can he be
stronger than One who draweth others to Him?” And He speaketh not of the Resurrection,
but of what is more than the Resurrection, “I will draw all men to Myself.” For had He said,
“I shall rise again,” it was not yet clear that they would believe; but by His saying, “they shall
believe,” both are proved at once, both this, and also that He must rise again. For had He
continued dead, and been a mere man, no one would have believed. “I will draw all men to
Myself.” ( c. vi. 44.) How then said He that the Father draweth? Because when the Son
draweth, the Father draweth also. He saith, “I will draw them,” as though they were detained
by a tyrant, and unable of themselves alone to approach Him, and to escape the hands of
him who keepeth hold of them. In another place He calleth this “spoiling; no man can1907
spoil a strong man’s goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoil his goods.”
( Matt. xii. 29.) This He said to prove His strength, and what there He calleth “spoiling,” He
hath here called “drawing.”</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us rouse ourselves, let us glorify God, not by our faith
alone, but also by our life, since otherwise it would not be glory, but blasphemy. For God is
not so much blasphemed by an impure heathen, as by a corrupt Christian. Wherefore I entreat
you to do all that God may be glorified; for, “Woe,” it saith, “to that servant by whom
the Name of God is blasphemed,” (and wherever there is a “woe,” every punishment and
vengeance straightway follows,) “but blessed is he by whom that Name is glorified.” Let us
then not be as in darkness, but avoid all sins, and especially those which tend to the hurt of
others, since by these God is most blasphemed. What pardon shall we have, when, being
commanded to give to others, we plunder the property of others? What shall be our hope
of salvation? Thou art punished if thou hast not fed the hungry; but if thou hast even stripped
one who was clothed, what sort of pardon shalt thou obtain? These things I will never desist
from saying, for they who have not heard to-day perhaps will hear tomorrow, and they who
take no heed to-morrow perhaps will be persuaded the next day; and even if any be so disposed
as not to be persuaded, yet for us there will be no account to give of them at the
Judgment. Our part we have fulfilled; may we never have cause to be ashamed of our words,
nor you to hide your faces, but may all be able to stand with boldness before the judgmentseat
of Christ, that we also may be able to rejoice over you, and to have some compensation
of our own faults, in your being approved in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXVIII.</head>
<p>John xii. 34</p>
<p>“The people answered Him, We have heard out of the Law that Christ abideth for ever; and
how sayest thou, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Deceit is a thing easily detected, and weak, though it be daubed outside with ten
thousand colors. For as those who whitewash decayed walls, cannot by the plastering make
them sound, so too those who lie are easily found out, as in fact was the case here with the
Jews. For when Christ said to them, “If I be lifted up I will draw all men unto Me; We have
heard,” saith one of them, “out of the Law, that Christ remaineth forever; and how sayest
thou, that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Even they then knew
that Christ was some Immortal One, and had life without end. And therefore they also knew
what He meant; for often in Scripture the Passion and the Resurrection are mentioned in
the same place. Thus Isaiah puts them together, saying, “He was led as a sheep to the
slaughter” ( Isa. liii. 7 ), and all that follows. David also in the second Psalm, and in many
other places, connects these two things. The Patriarch too after saying, “He lay down, He
couched as a lion,” addeth, “And as a lion’s whelp, who shall raise Him up?” ( Gen. xlix. 9.)
He showeth at once the Passion and the Resurrection. But these men when they thought to
silence Him, and to show that He was not the Christ, confessed by this very circumstance
that the Christ remaineth forever. And observe their evil dealing; they said not, “We have
heard that Christ neither suffereth nor is crucified,” but that “He remaineth forever.” Yet
even this which has been mentioned, would have been no real objection, for the Passion
was no hindrance to His Immortality. Hence we may see that they understood many of the
doubtful points, and deliberately went wrong. For since He had before spoken about death,
when they now heard in this place the, “be lifted up,” they guessed that death was referred
to. Then they said, “Who is this Son of Man?” This too they did deceitfully. “Think not, I
pray,” saith one, “that we say this concerning thee, assert not that we oppose thee through
enmity, for, lo, we know not concerning whom thou speakest, and still we declare our
opinion.” What then doth Christ? To silence them, and to show that the Passion is no impediment
to His enduring forever, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “Yet a little while,” He saith, “is the light with you.”</p>
<p>Signifying that His death was a removal;1908 for the light of the sun is not destroyed,
but having retired for a while appears again.</p>
<p>“Walk while ye have the light.”1909</p>
<note type="footnote">1908 i.e. temporary.</note>
<note type="footnote">1909 “Lest darkness come upon you,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="494"/>
<p>Of what season doth He here speak? Of the whole present life, or of the time before the
Crucifixion? I for my part think of both, for on account of His unspeakable lovingkindness,
many even after the Crucifixion believed. And He speaketh these things to urge them on to
the faith, as He also did before, saying, “Yet a little while I am with you.” ( c. vii. 33.)</p>
<p>“He that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.”</p>
<p>How many things, for instance, even now do the Jews, without knowing what they do,
but walking as though they were in darkness? They think that they are going the right way,
when they are taking the contrary; keeping1910 the Sabbath, respecting the Law and the
observances about meats, yet knowing not whither they walk. Wherefore He said,</p>
<p>Ver. 36. “Walk in the light,1911 that ye may become children of the light.”</p>
<p>That is, “My children.” Yet in the beginning the Evangelist saith, “Were born, not of
bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God” ( c. i. 13 ); that is, of the Father; while here
Himself1912 is said to beget them; that thou mayest understand that the operation of the
Father and the Son is One. “Jesus having spoken these things,” departed from them, and
did hide Himself.1913</p>
<p>Why doth He now “hide Himself”? They took not up stones against Him, nor did they
blaspheme Him in any such manner as before; why then did He hide Himself? Walking in
men’s hearts, He knew that their wrath was fierce, though they said nothing; He knew it
boiling and murderous, and waited not till it issued into action, but hid Himself, to allay
their ill-will. Observe how the Evangelist has alluded to this feeling; he has immediately
added,</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “Though He had done so many miracles,1914 they believed not on Him.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What “so many”? So many as the Evangelist hath omitted. And this1915 is clear also
from what follows. For when He had retired, and given in, and had come to them again, He
speaketh with them in a lowly manner, saying, “He that believeth on Me, believeth not on
Me, but on Him that sent Me.” ( Ver. 44.) Observe what He doeth. He beginneth with humble
and modest expressions, and betaketh Himself to the Father; then again He raiseth His
language, and when He seeth that they are exasperated, He retireth; then He cometh to them
again, and again beginneth with words of humility. And where hath He done this? Nay,
where hath He not done it? See, for instance, what He saith at the beginning, “As I hear, I
judge.” ( c. v. 30.) Then in a loftier tone, “As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
<note type="footnote">1910 Savile reads κατηγοροῦντες, conject. τηροῦντες, which is the Ben. reading.</note>

them, so also the Son quickeneth whom He will” ( c. v. 21 ); again, “I judge you not, there
is another that judgeth.” Then again He retireth. Then coming to Galilee, “Labor not,” He
saith, “for the meat that perisheth” ( c. vi. 27 ); and after having said great things of Himself,
that He came down from Heaven, that He giveth eternal life, He again withdraweth Himself.
And He cometh in the Feast of Tabernacles also, and doth the same. And one may see Him
continually thus varying His teaching, by His presence, by His absence, by lowly, by high
discourses. Which He also did here. “Though He had done so many miracles,” it saith, “they
believed not on Him.”</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “That the saying of Esaias1916 might be fulfilled which he spake, Lord, who
hath believed our report, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?” And again,</p>
<p>Ver. 39–41. “They1917 could not believe,” it saith, “because that Esaias said,1918 Ye shall
hear with your ears, and not understand.1919 These things he said,1920 when he saw His
glory, and spake of Him.”</p>
<p>Here again observe, that the “because,” and “spake,” refer not to the cause of their unbelief,
but to the event. For it was not “because” Isaiah spake, that they believed not; but
because they were not about to believe, that he spake. Why then doth not the Evangelist
express it so, instead of making the unbelief proceed from the prophecy, not the prophecy
from the unbelief? And farther on he putteth this very thing more positively, saying,
“Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said.” He desires hence to establish
by many proofs the unerring truth of Scripture, and that what Isaiah foretold fell not out
otherwise, but as he said. For lest any one should say, “Wherefore did Christ come? Knew
he not that they would give no heed to him?” he introduces the Prophets, who knew this
also. But He came that they might have no excuse for their sin; for what things the Prophet
foretold, he foretold as certainly to be; since if they were not certainly to be, he could not
have foretold them; and they were certainly to be, because these men were incurable.</p>
<p>And if, “they could not,” is put, instead of, “they would not,” do not marvel,1921 for He
saith also in another place, “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” ( Matt. xix. 12.)
So in many places He is wont to term choice, power. Again, “The world cannot hate you,
but Me it hateth.” ( c. vii. 7.) This one may even see observed in common conversation; as
when a man saith, “I cannot love this or that person,” calling the force of his will, power.

And again, “this or that person cannot be a good man.” And what saith the Prophet? “If the
Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the leopard his spots, this people also shall be able to do
good, having learned evil.” ( Jer. xiii. 23 , LXX.) He saith not that the doing of virtue is impossible
to them, but that because they will not, therefore they cannot. And by what he saith
the Evangelist means, that it was impossible for the Prophet to lie; yet it was not on that
account impossible that they should believe. For it was possible, even had they believed,
that he should remain true; since he would not have prophesied these things if they had
been about to believe. “Why then,” saith some one, “did he not say so?” Because Scripture
hath certain idiomatic phrases of this kind, and it is needful to make allowance for its laws.</p>
<p>“The seethings he spake when he saw His glory.” Whose? The Father’s. How then doth
John speak of the Son? and Paul of the Spirit? Not as confounding the Persons, but as
showing that the Dignity is one, they say it.1922 For that which is the Father’s is the Son’s
also, and that which is the Son’s is the Spirit’s.1923 Yet many things God spake by Angels,
and no one saith, “as the Angel spake,” but how? “as God spake.” Since what hath been said
by God through the ministry of Angels would be of God; yet not therefore is what is of God,
of the Angels also. But in this place John saith that the words are the Spirit’s.</p>
<p>“And spake of Him.” What spake he? “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high throne” ( Isa.
vi. 1 ), and what follows. Therefore he there calleth “glory,” that vision, the smoke, the
hearing unutterable Mysteries, the beholding the Seraphim, the lightning which leaped from
the throne, against which those powers could not look. “And spake of Him.” What said he?
That he heard a voice, saying, “Whom shall I send? who shall go? And I said, Here am I,
send me. And He said, Ye shall hear with your ears, and shall not understand, and seeing
ye shall see, and not perceive.” ( Isa. vi. 8, 10.) For,</p>
<p>Ver. 40. “He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they at any time
should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart.”</p>
<p>Here again is another question, but it is not so if we rightly consider it. For as the sun
dazzles the eyes of the weak, not by reason of1924 its proper nature, so it is with those who
give not heed to the words of God. Thus, in the case of Pharaoh, He is said to have hardened
his heart, and so it is with those who are at all contentious against the words of God. This
is a peculiar mode of speech in Scripture, as also the, “He gave them over unto a reprobate
mind” ( Rom. i. 28 ), and the, “He divided them to the nations,”1925 that is, allowed, permitted
them to go. For the writer doth not here introduce God as Himself working these things,

but showeth that they took place through the wickedness of others. For, when we are abandoned
by God, we are given up to the devil, and when so given up, we suffer ten thousand
dreadful things. To terrify the hearer, therefore, the writer saith, “He hardened,” and “gave
over.” For to show that He doth not only not give us over, but doth not even leave us, except
we will it, hear what He saith, “Do not your iniquities separate between Me and you?” ( Isa.
lix. 2 , LXX.). And again, “They that go far away from Thee shall perish.” ( Ps. lxxiii. 27 ,
LXX.) And Hosea saith, “Thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, and I will also forget thee”
( Hos. iv. 6 , LXX.); and He saith Himself also in the Gospels, “How often would I have
gathered your children—and ye would not.” ( Luke xiii. 34.) Esaias also again, “I came, and
there was no man; I called, and there was none to hearken.” ( Isa. l. 2 , LXX.) These things
He saith, showing that we begin the desertion, and become the causes of our perdition; for
God not only desireth not to leave or to punish us, but even when He punisheth, doth it
unwillingly; “I will not,” He saith, “the death of a sinner, so much as that he should turn
and live.” ( Ezek. xviii. 32 , LXX.) Christ also mourneth over the destruction of Jerusalem,1926
as we also do over our friends.</p>
<p><del>3</del> Knowing this, let us do all so as not to remove from God, but let us hold fast to the
care of our souls, and to the love towards each other; let us not tear our own members, (for
this1927 is the act of men insane and beside themselves,) but the more we see any ill disposed,
the more let us be kind to them. Since we often see many persons suffering1928 in their
bodies from difficult or incurable maladies, and cease not to apply remedies. What is worse
than gout in foot or hand? Are we therefore to cut off the limbs? Not at all, but we use every
means that the sufferer may enjoy some comfort, since we cannot get rid of the disease. This
also let us do in the case of our brethren, and, even though they be diseased incurably, let
us continue to tend them, and let us bear one another’s burdens. So shall we fulfill the law
of Christ, and obtain the promised good things, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xii. 42, 43</p>
<p>“Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees
they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the
praise of men more than the praise of God.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> It is necessary for us to avoid alike all the passions which corrupt the soul, but most
especially those, which from themselves generate numerous sins. I mean such as the love
of money. It is in truth of itself a dreadful malady, but it becomes much more grievous, because
it is the root and mother of all mischiefs. Such also is vainglory. See, for instance, how
these men were broken off from the faith through their love of honor. “Many,” it saith, “of
the chief rulers also believed on Him, but because of the Jews1929 they did not confess Him,
lest they should be put out of the synagogue.” As He said also to them before, “How can ye
believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God
only?” ( c. v. 44.) So then they were not rulers, but slaves in the utmost slavery. However,
this fear was afterwards done away, for nowhere during the time of the Apostles do we find
them possessed by this feeling, since in their time both rulers and priests believed. The grace
of the Spirit having come, made them all firmer than adamant. Since therefore this was what
hindered them from believing at this time, hear what He saith.</p>
<p>Ver. 44. “He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him that sent Me.”</p>
<p>As though He had said, “Why fear ye to believe on Me? Faith passeth to the Father
through Me, as doth also unbelief.” See how in every way He showeth the unvaryingness of
His Essence.1930 He said not, He that believeth “Me,” lest any should assert that He spake
concerning His words; this might have been said in the case of mere men, for he that believeth
the Apostles, believeth not them, but God. But that thou mightest learn that He speaketh
here of the belief on His Essence, He said not, “He that believeth My words,” but, “He that
believeth on Me.” “And wherefore,” saith some one, “hath He nowhere said conversely, He
that believeth on the Father, believeth not on the Father but on Me?” Because they would
have replied, “Lo, we believe on the Father, but we believe not on thee.” Their disposition
was as yet too infirm. Anyhow, conversing with the disciples, He did speak thus: “Ye believe
on the Father,1931 believe also on Me” ( c. xiv. 1 ); but seeing that these then were too weak
to hear such words, He leadeth them in another way, showing1932 that it is not possible to
<note type="footnote">1929 “Pharisees,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1930 i.e. in respect of that of the Father.</note>
<note type="footnote">1931 “on God,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">1932 al. “He showeth.”</note>

<pb n="499"/>
believe on the Father, without believing on Him. And that thou mayest not deem that the
words are spoken as of man, He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 45. “He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me.”</p>
<p>What then! Is God a body? By no means. The “seeing” of which He here speaketh is
that of the mind, thence showing the Consubstantiality. And what is, “He that believeth on
Me”? It is as though one should say, “He that taketh water from the river, taketh it not from
the river but from the fountain”; or rather this image is too weak, when compared with the
matter before us.</p>
<p>Ver. 46. “I am come a light into the world.”1933</p>
<p>For since the Father is called by this name everywhere both in the Old (Testament) and
in the New, Christ useth the same name also; therefore Paul also calleth Him, “Brightness”
( Heb. i. 3 ), having learnt to do so from this source. And He showeth here His close relationship
with the Father, and that there is no separation1934 between them, if so be that He
saith that faith on Him is not on Him, but passeth on to the Father. And He called Himself
“light,” because He delivereth from error, and dissolveth mental darkness.</p>
<p>Ver. 47. “If any man hear not Me, and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to
judge the world, but to save the world.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For lest they should think, that for want of power He passed by the despisers,
therefore spake He the, “I came not to judge the world.” Then, in order that they might not
in this way be made more negligent, when they had learned that “he that believeth is saved,
and he that disbelieveth is punished,”1935 see how He hath also set before them a fearful
court of judgment, by going on to say,</p>
<p>Ver. 48. “He that rejecteth Me, and receiveth not My words, hath One to judge him.”</p>
<p>“If the Father judgeth no man, and thou art not come to judge the world, who judgeth
him?” “The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him.”1936 For since they said,
“He is not from God,” He saith this,1937 that, “they shall not then be able to say these things,
but the words which I have spoken now, shall be in place of an accuser, convicting them,
and cutting off all excuse.” “And the word which I have spoken.” What manner of word?</p>
<p>Ver. 49. “For I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which sent Me, He gave Me a
commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.” And other such like.1938</p>
<note type="footnote">1933 “that whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness,” N.T.</note>

<p>Surely these things were said for their sakes, that they might have no pretense of excuse.
Since if this were not the case, what shall He have more than Isaiah? for he too saith the very
same thing, “The Lord God giveth me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when
I ought to speak a word.” ( Isa. l. 4 , LXX.) What more than Jeremiah? for he too when he
was sent was inspired. ( Jer. i. 9.) What then Ezekiel? for he too, after eating the roll, so spake.
( Ezek. iii. 1.) Otherwise also, they who were about to hear what He said shall be found to
be causes of His knowledge. For if when He was sent, He then received commandment what
He should say, thou wilt then argue that before He was sent He knew not. And what more
impious than these assertions? if (that is) one take the words of Christ in this sense, and
understand not the cause1939 of their lowliness? Yet Paul saith, that both he and those who
were made disciples knew “what was that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (
Rom. xii. 2 ), and did the Son not know until He had received commandment? How can
this be reasonable? Seest thou not that He bringeth His expressions to an excess of humility,
that He may both draw those men over, and silence those who should come after. This is
why He uttereth words befitting a mere man, that even so He may force us to fly the meanness
of the sayings, as being conscious that the words belong not to His Nature, but are suited
to the infirmity of the hearers.</p>
<p>Ver. 50. “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting; whatsoever I speak
therefore, even as the Father said unto Me, so I speak.”</p>
<p>Seest thou the humility of the words? For he that hath received a commandment is not
his own master. Yet He saith, “As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even
so the Son quickeneth whom He will.” ( c. v. 21.) Hath He then power to quicken whom He
will, and to say what He will hath He not power? What He intendeth then by the words is
this;1940 “The action hath not natural possibility,1941 that He should speak one set of words,
and I should utter another.” “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting.” He
said this to those that called Him a deceiver, and asserted that He had come to do hurt. But
when He saith, “I judge not,” He showeth that He is not the cause of the perdition of these
men.1942 By this He all but plainly testifies, when about to remove from, and to be no more
with, them, that “I converse with you, speaking nothing as of Myself, but all as from the
Father.” And for this cause He confined His discourse to them to humble expressions, that
He might say, “Even until the end did I utter this, My last word, to them.” What word was
that? “As the Father said unto Me, so I speak.” “Had I been opposed to God I should have
said the contrary, that I speak nothing of what is pleasing to God, so as to attract the honor

to Myself, but now I have so referred all things to Him, as to call nothing My own.1943 Why
then do ye not believe Me when I say that ‘I have received a commandment,’ and when I so
vehemently remove your evil suspicion respecting rivalry? For as it is impossible for those
who have received a commandment to do or say anything but what their senders wish, as
long as they fulfill the commandment, and do not forge1944 anything; so neither is it possible
for Me to say or do anything except as My Father willeth. For what I do He doeth, because
He is with Me, and ‘the Father hath not left Me alone.’” ( c. viii. 29.) Seest thou how everywhere
He showeth Himself connected with Him who begat Him, and that there is no separation?
1945 For when He saith, “I am not come of Myself,” He saith it not, as depriving
Himself of power, but as taking away all alienation or opposition.1946 For if men are masters
of themselves, much more the Only-begotten Son. And to show that this is true, hear what
Paul saith,1947 “He emptied Himself, and gave Himself for us.” ( Philip. ii. 7.) But, as I said,
a terrible thing is vainglory, very terrible ( Eph. v. 2 ); for this made these men not to believe,
and others to believe ill, so that the things which were said for the sake of those men, through
lovingkindness, they turned to1948 impiety.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then ever flee this monster: various and manifold it is, and everywhere sheds
its peculiar venom, in wealth, in luxury, in beauty of person. Through this we everywhere
go beyond needful use;1949 through this arises extravagance in garments, and a great swarm
of domestics; through this the needful use is every where despised, in our houses, our garments,
our table; and extravagance prevails. Wilt thou enjoy glory? Do alms-deeds, then
shall Angels praise thee, then shall God receive thee. Now the admiration goes no farther
than the goldsmiths and weavers, and thou1950 departest without a crown, often seeing that
thou receivest curses. But if thou put not these things about thy body, but expend them in
feeding the poor, great will be the applause from all sides, great the praise. Then shalt thou
have them, when thou givest them to others; when thou keepest them to thyself, then thou
hast them not. For a house is a faithless treasury, but a sure treasury are the hands of the
poor. Why adornest thou thy body, while thy soul is neglected, possessed by uncleanness?
Why bestowest thou not so much thought on thy soul, as thy body? Thou oughtest to bestow
greater; but anyhow, beloved,1951 we ought to bestow equal care upon it. For tell me, if any

one asked thee which thou wouldest choose, that thy body should be fresh and of good habit
and surpassing in beauty, and wear mean raiment, or having the body deformed and full of
diseases, to wear gold and finery; wouldest thou not much prefer to have beauty depending
on the nature of thy person, than on the raiment with which thou art clothed? And wilt thou
choose this in the case of thy body, but the contrary in the case of thy soul; and, when thou
hast that ugly and unsightly and black, dost thou think to gain anything from golden ornaments?
What madness is this! Shift this adorning within, put these necklaces about thy soul.
The things that are put about thy body help neither to its health nor to its beauty, for it will
not make black white, nor what is ugly either beautiful or good looking. But if thou put
them about thy soul, thou shalt soon make it white instead of black, instead of ugly and
unsightly, thou shalt make it beautiful and well-favored. The words are not mine, but those
of the Lord Himself, who saith, “Though thy sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as
snow” ( Isa. i. 18 , LXX.); and, “Give alms—and all things shall be clean unto you” ( Luke
xi. 41 ); and by such a disposition thou shalt beautify not thyself only, but thy husband. For
they if they see you putting off these outward ornaments, will have no great need of expense,
and not having it, they will abstain from all covetousness, and will be more inclined to give
alms, and ye too will be able boldly to give them fitting counsel. At present ye are deprived
of all such authority. For with what mouth will ye speak of these things? with what eyes will
ye look your husbands in the face, asking money for alms, when ye spend most upon the
covering of your bodies? Then wilt thou be able boldly to speak with thy husband concerning
alms-giving, when thou layest aside thine ornaments of gold. Even if thou accomplish
nothing, thou hast fulfilled all thy part; but I should rather say, that it is impossible that the
wife should not gain the husband, when she speaks by the very actions.1952 “For what
knowest thou, O woman, whether thou shalt save thy husband?” ( 1 Cor. vii. 16.) As then
now thou shalt give account both for thyself and for him, so if thou put off all this vanity
thou shalt have a double crown, wearing thy crown and triumphing1953 with thy husband
through those unalloyed1954 ages, and enjoying the everlasting good things, which may we
all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiii. 1</p>
<p>“Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour was come that He should
depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the world,
He loved them unto the end.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “Be ye imitators of me,” said Paul, “as I also am of Christ.” ( 1 Cor. xi. 1.) For on
this account He took also flesh of our substance,1955 that by means of it He might teach us
virtue. For (“God sending His own Son) in the likeness of sinful flesh,” it saith, “and for sin
condemned sin in the flesh.” ( Rom. viii. 3.) And Christ Himself1956 saith, “Learn of Me,
for I am meek and lowly in heart.” ( Matt. xi. 29.) And this He taught, not by words alone,
but by actions also. For they called Him a Samaritan, and one that had a devil, and a deceiver,
and cast stones at Him; and at one time the Pharisees sent servants to take1957 Him, at an-
other they sent plotters against Him; and they continued also insulting Him themselves,
and that when they had no fault to find, but were even being continually benefited. Still after
such conduct He ceaseth not to do well to them both by words and deeds. And, when a
certain domestic smote Him on the face, He said, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
evil, but if well, why smitest thou Me?” ( c. xviii. 23.) But this was to those who hated and
plotted against Him. Let us see also what He doeth now towards the disciples, or rather what
actions He now exhibiteth1958 towards the traitor. The man whom most of all there was
reason1959 to hate, because being a disciple, having shared the table and the salt, having
seen the miracles and been deemed worthy of such great things, he acted more grievously
than any, not stoning indeed, nor insulting Him, but betraying and giving Him up, observe
in how friendly sort He receiveth this man, washing his feet; for even in this way He desired
to restrain him from that wickedness. Yet it was in His power, had He willed it, to have
withered him like the fig-tree, to have cut him in two as He rent the rocks, to have cleft him
asunder like the veil; but He would not lead him away from his design by compulsion, but
by choice. Wherefore He washed his feet; and not even by this was that wretched and
miserable man shamed.</p>
<p>“Before the feast of the Passover,” it saith, “Jesus knowing that His hour was come.”
Not then “knowing,” but (it means) that He did what He did having “known” long ago.

“That He should depart.” Magnificently1960 the Evangelist calleth His death, “departure.”
“Having loved His own, He loved them unto the end.” Seest thou how when about to leave
them He showeth greater love? For the, “having loved, He loved them unto the end,” showeth
that he omitted nothing of the things which it was likely that one who earnestly loved would
do. Why, then did He not this from the beginning? He worketh1961 the greatest things last,
so as to render more intense their attachment, and to lay up for them beforehand much
comfort, against the terrible things that were about to fall on them. St. John calls them “His
own,” in respect of personal attachment, since he calls others also “His own,” in respect of
the work of creation; as when he saith, “His own received Him not.” ( c. i. 11.) But what
meaneth, “which were in the world”? Because the dead also were “His own,” Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and the men of that sort,1962 but they were not in the world. Seest thou that
He is the God both of the Old and New (Testament)? But what meaneth, “He loved them
unto the end”? It stands for, “He continued loving them unceasingly,” and this the Evangelist
mentions as a sure proof of great affection. Elsewhere indeed He spake of another (proof),
the laying down life for His friends; but that had not yet come to pass. And wherefore did
He this thing “now”? Because it was far more wonderful at a time when He appeared more
glorious in the sight of all men. Besides, He left them no small consolation now that He was
about to depart, for since they were going to be greatly grieved, He by these means introduceth
also comfort to the grief.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “And supper being ended, the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas1963
to betray Him.”</p>
<p>This the Evangelist hath said1964 amazed, showing that Jesus washed the man who had
already chosen to betray Him. This also proves his great wickedness, that not even the having
shared the salt restrained him, (a thing which is most able to restrain wickedness;) not the
fact that even up to the last day, his Master continued to bear with him.1965</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “Jesus knowing that the Father had given1966 all things into His hands, and that
He was come from God, and went to God.”</p>
<p>Here the Evangelist saith, even1967 wondering, that one so great, so very great, who
came from God and went to Him, who ruleth over all, did this thing, and disdained not

<pb n="505"/>
even so to undertake such an action. And by the “giving over,” methinks St. John means
the salvation of the faithful. For when He saith, “All things are given over1968 to Me of My
Father” ( Matt. xi. 27 ), He speaketh of this kind of giving over; as also in another place He
saith, “Thine they were, and Thou gavest them Me” ( c. xvii. 6 ); and again, “No man can
come unto Me except the Father draw him” ( c. vi. 44 ); and, “Except it be given him from
heaven.” ( c. iii. 27 .) The Evangelist then either means this, or that Christ would be nothing
lessened by this action, since He came from God, and went to God, and possessed all things.
But when thou hearest of “giving over,” understand it in no human sense, for it showeth
how He honoreth the Father, and His unanimity with Him. For as the Father giveth over
to Him, so He to the Father. And this Paul declares, saying, “When He shall have given
over1969 the kingdom to God, even the Father.” ( 1 Cor. xv. 24.) But St. John hath said it
here in a more human sense, showing His great care for them, and declaring His unutterable
love, that He now cared for them as for His own; teaching them the mother of all good, even
humblemindedness, which He said was both the beginning and the end of virtue. And not
without a reason is added the,1970 “He came from God and went to God”: but that we may
learn that He did what was worthy1971 of One who came thence and went thither, trampling
down all pride.</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “And having risen1972 from supper, and laid aside His garments.”1973</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Observe how not by the washing only, but in another way also He exhibiteth humility.
For it was not before reclining, but after they had all sat down, then He arose. In the next
place, He doth not merely wash them, but doth so, putting off His garments. And He did
not even stop here, but girded Himself with a towel. Nor was He satisfied with this, but
Himself filled (the basin), and did not bid another fill it; He did all these things Himself,
showing by all that we must do such things, when we are engaged in well doing, not merely
for form’s sake,1974 but with all zeal. Now He seemeth to me to have washed the feet of the
traitor first from its saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “He began to wash the disciples’ feet,”1975 and adding,</p>

<p>Ver. 6. “Then cometh He to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto Him, Lord, dost Thou
wash my feet?”</p>
<p>“With those hands,” he saith, “with which Thou hast opened eyes, and cleansed lepers,
and raised the dead?” For this (question) is very emphatic; wherefore He needed not to have
said any more than the, “Thou”; for even of itself this would have sufficed to convey the
whole. Some one might reasonably enquire, how none of the others forbade Him, but Peter
only, which was a mark of no slight love and reverence. What then is the cause? He seemeth
to me to have washed the traitor first, then to have come to Peter, and that the others were
afterwards instructed from his case.1976 That He washed some one other before him is clear
from its saying, “But when He came1977 to Peter.” Yet the Evangelist is not a vehement accuser,
1978 for the “began,” is the expression of one implying this. And even if Peter were
the first,1979 yet it is probable that the traitor, being a forward person, had reclined even
before the chief.1980 For by another circumstance also his forwardness is shown, when He
dippeth with his Master in the dish, and being convicted, feels no compunction; while Peter
being rebuked but once on a former occasion, and for words which he spake from loving
affection, was so abashed, that being even distressed and trembling, he begged another to
ask a question. But Judas, though continually convicted, felt not. ( Ver. 24.) When therefore
He came to Peter, he saith unto Him, “Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?”</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “He saith unto him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know here
after.”</p>
<p>That is “thou shalt know how great is the gain from this, the profit of the lesson, and
how it is able to guide us into all humblemindedness.” What then doth Peter? He still hinders
Him, and saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “Thou shalt never wash my feet.” “What doest thou, Peter? Rememberest thou
not those former words? Saidst thou not, ‘Be merciful to Thyself,’1981 and heardest thou
not in return, ‘Get thee behind Me, Satan’? ( Matt. xvi. 22.) Art thou not even so sobered,
but art thou yet vehement?” “Yea,” he saith, “for what is being done is a great matter, and
full of amazement.” Since then he did this from exceeding love, Christ in turn subdueth him
by the same; and as there He effected this by sharply rebuking him, and saying, “Thou art
an offense unto Me,” so here also by saying,</p>
<note type="footnote">1976 ἀ π̓ ἐκείνου, al. ὑ π̓ ἐκ. “by him.”</note>

<p>“If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me.” What then saith that hot and burning
one?</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”</p>
<p>Vehement in deprecation, he becometh yet more vehement in acquiescence; but both
from love. For why said He not wherefore He did this, instead of adding a threat? Because
Peter would not have been persuaded. For had He said, “Suffer it, for by this I persuade you
to be humbleminded,” Peter would have promised it ten thousand times, in order that his
Master might not do this thing. But now what saith He? He speaketh of that which Peter
most feared and dreaded, the being separated from Him; for it is he who continually asks,
“Whither goest Thou?” ( Ver. 36.) Wherefore also he said, “I will give1982 even my life for
Thee.” ( Ver. 37.) And if, after hearing, “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
know hereafter,” he still persisted, much more would he have done so had he learnt (the
meaning of the action). Therefore said He, “but thou shalt know hereafter,” as being aware,
that should he learn it immediately he would still resist. And Peter said not, “Tell me, that
I may suffer Thee,” but (which was much more vehement) he did not even endure to learn,
but withstands Him,1983 saying, “Thou shalt never wash my feet.” But as soon as He
threatened, he straightway relaxed his tone. But what meaneth, “Thou shalt know after this”?
“After this?” When? “When in My Name thou shalt have cast out devils; when thou shalt
have seen Me taken up into Heaven, when thou shalt have learnt from the Spirit1984 that I
sit1985 on His right hand, then shalt thou understand what is being done now.” What then
saith Christ? When Peter said, “not my feet only, but also my hands and my head,” He
replieth,</p>
<p>Ver. 10, 11. “He that is washed, needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit;
and ye are clean,1986 but not all. For He knew who should betray Him.”1987</p>
<p>“And if they are clean, why washeth He1988 their feet?” That we may learn to be modest.
1989 On which account He came not to any other part of the body, but to that which is
considered more dishonorable than the rest. But what is, “He that is washed”? It is instead
of, “he that is clean.” Were they then clean, who had not1990 yet been delivered from their

sins, nor deemed worthy of the Spirit, since sin still had the mastery, the handwriting of the
curse still remaining, the victim not having yet been offered? How then calleth He them
“clean”? That thou mayest not deem them clean, as delivered from their sins, He addeth,1991
Behold, “ye are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.” That is, “In this way
ye are so far1992 clean; ye have received the light, ye have been freed from Jewish error. For
the Prophet also saith, ‘Wash you, make you clean, put away the wickedness from your
souls’ ( Isa. i. 16 , LXX.); so that such a one is washed and is clean.” Since then these men
had cast away all wickedness from their souls, and had companied with Him with a pure
mind, therefore He saith according to the word of the Prophet, “he that is washed is clean
already.” For in that place also It meaneth not the “washing” of water, practiced by the Jews;
but the cleansing of the conscience.1993</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Be we then also clean; learn we to do well. But what is “well”? “Judge for the fatherless,
plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.” ( Isa. i. 7.) There
is frequent mention in the Scriptures of widows and orphans, but we make no account of
this. Yet consider how great is the reward. “Though,” it saith, “your sins be as scarlet, I will
whiten them as snow; though they be red like crimson, I will whiten them as wool.” For a
widow is an unprotected being, therefore He1994 taketh much care for her. For they, when
it is even in their power to contract a second marriage, endure the hardships of widowhood
through fear of God. Let us then all, both men and women, stretch forth our hands to them,
that we may never undergo the sorrows of widow-hood; or if we should have to undergo
them, let us lay up1995 a great store of kindness for ourselves. Not small is the power of the
widow’s tears, it is able to open heaven itself. Let us not then trample on them, nor make
their calamity worse, but assist them by every means. If so we do, we shall put around1996
ourselves much safety, both in the present life, and in that which is to come. For not here
alone, but there also will they be our defenders, cutting away most of our sins by reason of
our beneficence towards them, and causing us to stand boldly before the judgment-seat of
Christ. Which1997 may it come to pass that we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiii</p>
<p>“And He took1998 His garments, and having sat down again, said unto them, Know ye what
I have done to you?” And what follows.</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A grievous thing, beloved, a grievous thing it is to come to the depths of wickedness;
for then the soul becomes hard to be restored. Wherefore we should use every exertion not
to be taken at all;1999 since it is easier not to fall in,2000 than having fallen to recover one’s
self. Observe, for instance, when Judas had thrown himself into sin, how great assistance
he enjoyed, yet not even so was he raised. Christ said to him, “One of you is a devil” ( c. vi.
71 ); He said, “Not all believe” ( c. vi. 65 ); He said, “I speak not of all,” and, “I know whom
I have chosen” ( c. xiii. 18 ); and not one of these sayings doth he feel. Now when He had
washed their feet, and taken His garments, and sat down, He said, “Know ye what I have
done unto you?” He no longer addresseth Himself to Peter only, but to them all.</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Ye call Me Lord2001 and Master,2002 and ye say well, for so I am.”</p>
<p>“Ye call Me.” He taketh to Him their judgment, and then that the words may not be
thought to be words of their kindness, He addeth, “for so I am.” By introducing a saying of
theirs,2003 He maketh it not offensive, and by confirming it Himself when introduced from
them, unsuspected. “For so I am,” He saith. Seest thou how when He converseth with the
disciples, He speaketh revealing more what belongeth unto Himself? As He saith, “Call no
man master on earth,2004 for One is your guide”2005 ( Matt. xxiii. 8, 9 ), so also, “And call
no man father upon earth.” But the “one” and “one”2006 is spoken not of the Father only,
but of Himself also. For had He spoken excluding Himself, how saith He, “That ye may become
the children of the light”? And again, if He called the Father only, “Master,” how saith
He, “For so I am”; and again, “For one is your Guide, even Christ”? ( c. xii. 26.)</p>

<p>Ver. 14, 15. “If I then,” He saith, “your Lord2007 and Master have washed your feet, ye
ought also to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do
as I have done to you.”</p>
<p>And yet it is not the same thing, for He is Lord and Master, but ye are fellow-servants
one of another. What meaneth then the “as”? “With the same zeal.” For on this account He
taketh instances from greater actions that we may, if so be, perform the less. Thus schoolmasters
write the letters for children very beautifully, that they may come to imitate them
though but in an inferior manner. Where now are they who spit on their fellow-servants?
where now they who demand honors? Christ washed the feet of the traitor, the sacrilegious,
the thief, and that close to the time of the betrayal, and incurable as he was, made him a
partaker of His table; and art thou highminded, and dost thou draw up thine eyebrows?
“Let us then wash one another’s feet,” saith some one, “then we must wash those of our
domestics.” And what great thing if we do wash even those of our domestics? In our case2008
“slave” and “free” is a difference of words; but there an actual reality. For by nature He was
Lord and we servants, yet even this2009 He refused not at this time to do. But now it is
matter for contentment if we do not treat free men as bondmen, as slaves bought with
money. And what shall we say in that day,2010 if after receiving proofs of such forbearance,
we ourselves do not imitate them at all, but take the contrary part, being in diametrical opposition,
lifted up, and not discharging the debt? For God hath made us debtors one to another,
having first so done Himself, and hath made us debtors of a less amount. For He was
our Lord, but we do it, if we do it at all, to our fellow-servants, a thing which He Himself
implied by saying, “If I then your Lord and Master—so also do ye.” It would indeed naturally
have followed to say, “How much more should ye servants,” but He left this to the conscience
of the hearers.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> But why hath He done this “now”? They were for the future to enjoy, some greater,
some less honor. In order then that they may not exalt themselves one above the other, and
say as they did before, “Who is the greatest” ( Matt. xviii. 1 ), nor be angry one against the
other, He taketh down2011 the high thoughts of them all, by saying, that “although thou
mayest be very great, thou oughtest to have no high thoughts towards thy brother.” And
He mentioned not the greater action, that “if I have washed the feet of the traitor, what great
matter if ye one another’s?” but having exemplified this by deeds, He then left it to the
judgment of the spectators. Therefore He said, “Whosoever shall do and teach, the same

shall be called great” ( Matt. v. 19 ); for this is “to teach” a thing, actually to do it. What pride
should not this remove? what kind of folly and insolence should it not annihilate!2012 He
who sitteth upon the Cherubim washed the feet of the traitor, and dost thou, O man, thou
that art earth and ashes and cinders and dust, dost thou exalt thyself, and art thou highminded?
And how great a hell wouldest thou not deserve? If then thou desirest a high state
of mind, come, I will show thee the way to it; for thou dost not even know what it is. The
man then who gives heed to the present things as being great, is of a mean soul; so that there
can neither be humility without greatness of soul, nor conceit except from littleness of soul.
For as little children are eager for trifles, gaping upon balls and hoops and dice,2013 but
cannot even form an idea of important matters; so in this case, one who is truly wise, will
deem present things as nothing, (so that he will neither choose to acquire them himself, nor
to receive them from others;) but he who is not of such a character will be affected in a
contrary way, intent upon cobwebs and shadows and dreams of things less substantial than
these.</p>
<p>Ver. 16–18. “Verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord, neither he
that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
I speak not of you all2014 —but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with
Me hath lifted up his heel against Me.”</p>
<p>What He said before, this He saith here also, to shame them; “For if the servant is not
greater than his master, nor he that is sent greater than him that sent him, and these things
have been done by Me, much more ought they to be done by you.” Then, lest any one should
say, “Why now sayest Thou these things? Do we not already know them?” He addeth this
very thing, “I speak not to you as not knowing, but that by your actions ye may show forth
the things spoken of.” For “to know,” belongeth to all; but “to do,” not to all. On this account
He said, “Blessed are ye if ye do them”; and on this account I continually and ever say the
same to you, although ye know it, that I may set you on the work. Since even Jews “know,”
but yet they are not “blessed”; for they do not what they know.2015</p>
<p>“I speak not,” He saith, “of you all.” O what forbearance! Not yet doth He convict the
traitor, but veileth the matter, hence giving him room for repentance. He convicteth and
yet doth not convict him when He saith thus, “He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up
his heel against Me.” It seems to me that the, “The servant is not greater than his lord,” was
uttered for this purpose also, that if any persons should at any time suffer harm either from
domestics or from any of the meaner sort, they should not be offended; looking to the in-

stance of Judas, who having enjoyed ten thousand good things, repaid his Benefactor with
the contrary. On this account He added, “He that eateth bread with Me,” and letting pass
all the rest, He hath put that which was most fitted to restrain and shame him; “he who was
fed by Me,” He saith, “and who shared My table.” And He spake the words, to instruct them
to benefit those who did evil to them, even though such persons should continue incurable.</p>
<p>But having said, “I speak not of you all,” in order not to attach fear to more than one,2016
He at last separateth the traitor, speaking thus; “He that eateth bread with Me.” For the,
“not of you all,” doth not direct the words to any single one, therefore He added, “He that
eateth bread with Me”; showing to that wretched one that He was not seized in ignorance,
but even with full knowledge; a thing which of itself was most of all fitted to restrain him.
And He said not, “betrayeth Me,” but, “hath lifted up his heel against Me,” desiring to represent
the deceit, the treachery, the secrecy of the plot.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> These things are written that we bear not malice towards those who injure us; but
rebuke them and weep for them; for the fit subjects of weeping are not they who suffer, but
they who do the wrong. The grasping man, the false accuser, and whoso worketh any other
evil thing, do themselves the greatest injury, and us the greatest good, if we do not avenge
ourselves. Such a case as this: some one has robbed thee; hast thou given thanks for the injury,
and glorified God? by that thanksgiving thou hast gained ten thousand rewards, just as he
hath gathered for himself fire unspeakable. But if any one say, “How then, if I ‘could’ not
defend myself against him who wronged me, being weaker?” I would say this, that thou
couldest have put into action the being discontented, the being impatient, (for these things
are in our power,) the praying against him, who grieved you, the uttering ten thousand
curses against him, the speaking ill of him to every one. He therefore who hath not done
these things shall even be rewarded for not defending himself, since it is clear that even if
he had had the power, he would not have done it. The injured man uses any weapon that
comes to hand, when, being little of soul, he defends himself against one who has injured
him, by curses, by abuse, by plotting. Do thou then not only not do these things, but even
pray for him; for if thou do them not, but wilt even pray for him, thou art become like unto
God. For, “pray,” it saith, “for them, that despitefully use you—that ye may be like unto2017
your Father which is in Heaven.” ( Matt. v. 44, 45.) Seest thou how we are the greatest
gainers from the insolence of others? Nothing so delighteth God, as the not returning evil
for evil? But what say I? Not returning evil for evil? Surely we are enjoined to return the
opposite, benefits, prayers. Wherefore Christ also repaid him who was about to betray Him
with everything opposite. He washed his feet, convicted him secretly, rebuked him sparingly,

tended2018 him, allowed him to share His table and His kiss, and not even by these2019 was
he made better; nevertheless (Christ) continued doing His own part.</p>
<p>But come, let us teach thee even from the example of servants, and (to make the lesson
stronger) those in the Old (Testament), that thou mayest know that we have no ground of
defense when we remember a wrong. Will you then that I tell you of Moses, or shall we go
yet farther back? For the more ancient the instances that can be pointed out, the more are
we surpassed. “Why so?” Because virtue was then more difficult. Those men had no written
precepts, no patterns of living, but their nature fought, unarmed, by itself,2020 and was
forced to float in all directions unballasted.2021 Wherefore also when praising Noah, God
called him not simply perfect, but added, “in his generation” ( Gen. vii. 1 ); signifying, “at
that time,” when there were many hindrances, since many others shone after him, yet will
he have nothing less than they; for in his own time he was perfect. Who then before Moses
was patient? The blessed and noble Joseph, who having shone by his chastity, shone no less
by his long suffering. He was sold when he had done no wrong, but was waiting on others,
and serving, and performing all the duties of domestics. They brought against him an evil
accusation, and he did not defend himself, though he had his father on his side. Nay, he
even went to carry food to them in the desert, and when he found them not, he did not
despair or turn back, (yet he had an excuse for doing so had he chosen,) but remained near
the wild beasts and those savage men, preserving the feeling of a true brother. Again, when
he dwelt in the prison house, and was asked the cause, he spake no evil of them, but only,
“I have done nothing,” and, “I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews”; and after this
again, when he was made lord, he nourished them, and delivered them from ten thousand
dangers. If we be sober, the wickedness of our neighbor is not strong enough to cast us out
of our own virtue. But those others were not like him; they both stripped him, and endeavored
to kill him, and reproach him with his dream, though they had even received their meat
from him, and planned to deprive him of life and of liberty. And they ate, and cared not for
their brother lying naked in the pit. What could be worse than such brutality? Were they
not worse than any number of murderers? And after this, having drawn him up, they gave
him over to ten thousand deaths, selling him to barbarian and savage men, who were on
their journey to barbarians. Yet he, when he became ruler, not only remitted them their
punishment, but even acquitted them, as far at least as relating to himself, of their sin, calling
what had been done a dispensation of God, not any wickedness of theirs; and the things
which he did against them he did not as remembering evil, but in all these he dissembled,

for his brother’s2022 sake. After this, when he saw them clinging to him, he straightway
threw away the mask, and wept aloud, and embraced them, as though he had received the
greatest benefits, he, who formerly was made away with by them, and he brought them all
down into Egypt, and repaid them with ten thousand benefits. What excuse then shall we
have, if after the Law, and after grace, and after the addition of so much heavenly wisdom,
we do not even strive to rival him who lived before grace and before the Law? Who shall
deliver us from punishment? For there is nothing, there is nothing more grievous than the
remembrance of injuries. And this the man hath showed that owed ten thousand talents;
from whom payment was at one time not demanded, at another time again demanded; not
demanded, because of the lovingkindness of God; but demanded, because of his own
wickedness, and because of his malice toward his fellow-servant. Knowing all which things,
let us forgive our neighbors their trespasses, and repay them by deeds of an opposite kind,
that we too may obtain mercy from God, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiii. 20 .2023</p>
<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth Me: and He
that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great is the recompense2024 of care bestowed upon the servants of God, and of itself2025
it yieldeth to us its fruits. For, “he that receiveth you,” it saith, “receiveth Me, and
he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me.” ( Matt. x. 40.) Now what can be equal
to the receiving Christ and His Father? But what kind of connection hath this with what
was said before? What hath it in common with that which He had said, “If ye do these things
happy are ye,” to add, “He that receiveth you”? A close connection, and very harmonious.2026
Observe how. When they were about to go forth and to suffer many dreadful things, He
comforteth them in two ways; one derived from Himself, the other derived from others.
“For if,” He saith, “ye are truly wise, ever keeping Me in mind, and bearing about all both
what I said, and what I did, ye will easily endure terrible things. And not in this way only,
but also from your enjoying great attention from all men.” The first point He declared when
He said, “If ye do these things happy are ye”; the second when He said, “He that receiveth
you receiveth Me.” For He opened the houses of all men to them, so that both from the
sound wisdom of their manners, and the zeal of those who would tend them, they might
have twofold comfort. Then when He had given these directions to them as to men about
to run through all the world, reflecting that the traitor was deprived of both of these things,
and would enjoy neither of them, neither patience in toils, nor the service of kind entertainers,
He again was troubled. And the Evangelist to signify this besides, and to show that it was
on his2027 account that He was troubled, adds,</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “When Jesus had thus said, He was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray Me.”</p>
<p>Again He bringeth fear on all by not mentioning (the traitor) by name.</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “But they are in doubt”;2028 although conscious to themselves of nothing evil;
but they deemed the declaration of Christ more to be believed than their own thoughts.

<pb n="516"/>
Wherefore they “looked one on another.” By laying the whole upon one, Jesus would2029
have cut short their fear, but by adding, “one of you,” He troubled all. What then? The rest
looked upon one another; but the ever fervent Peter “beckoneth”2030 to John. Since he had
been before rebuked, and when Christ desired to wash him would have hindered Him, and
since he is everywhere found moved indeed by love, yet blamed; being on this account afraid,
he neither kept quiet, nor did he speak, but wished to gain information by means of John.
But it is a question worth asking, why when all were distressed, and trembling, when their
leader was afraid, John like one at ease2031 leans on Jesus’ bosom, and not only leans, but
even (lies) on His breast? Nor is this the only thing worthy of enquiry, but that also which
follows. What is that? What he saith of himself, “Whom Jesus loved.” Why did no one else
say this of himself? yet the others were loved too. But he more than any. And if no other
hath said this about him, but he about himself, it is nothing wonderful. Paul too does the
same,2032 when occasion calls, saying thus, “I knew a man fourteen years ago”; yet in fact
he2033 has gone through other no trifling praises of himself. Seems it to thee a small thing
that, when he had heard, “Follow Me,”2034 he straightway left his nets, and his father, and
followed; and that Christ took him alone with Peter into the mountain, ( Matt. xvii. 1 ,) and
another time again when He went into a house?2035 ( Luke viii. 51.) What high praise also
has he himself passed on Peter without concealment, telling us that Christ said, “Peter,2036
lovest thou Me more than these?” ( c. xxi. 15 ), and everywhere he showeth him warm, and
nobly disposed towards himself;2037 for instance, when he said, “Lord, and what shall this
man do?” he spake from great love. But why did2038 no other say (this2039) concerning him?

Because he would not himself have said it, unless he had come to this passage.2040 For if
after telling us that Peter beckoned to John to ask, he had added nothing more, he would
have caused considerable doubt, and have compelled us to enquire into the reason. In order
therefore himself to solve this difficulty, he saith, “He lay on the bosom of Jesus.” Thinkest
thou that thou hast learnt a little thing when thou hast heard that “he lay,” and that their
Master allowed such boldness to them?2041 If thou desirest to know the cause of this, the
action was of love;2042 wherefore he saith, “Whom Jesus loved.”2043 I suppose also that John
doth this for another reason, as wishing to show that he was exempt from the charge and
so he speaks openly and is confident. Again, why did he use these words, not at any other
point of time,2044 but only when the chief of the Apostles beckoned? That thou mightest
not deem that Peter beckoned to him as being greater, he saith that the thing took place
because of the great love (which Jesus bare him). But why doth he even lie on His bosom?
They had not as yet formed any high surmises concerning Him; besides, in this way He2045
calmed their despondency; for it is probable that at this time their faces were overclouded.
If they were troubled in their souls, much more would they be so in their countenances.
Soothing them therefore by word and by the question, He makes a way beforehand, and
allows him to lean on His breast. Observe too his modesty; he mentions not his own name,
but, “whom He loved.” As also Paul, when he said, “I knew a man about fourteen years ago.”
Now for the first time Jesus convicted the traitor, but not even now by name; but how?</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “He it is, to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it.”2046</p>
<p>Even the manner (of the rebuke) was calculated to put him to shame. He respected not
the table, though he shared the bread; be it so; but the receiving the sop from His own hand,
whom would not that have won over? yet him it won not.</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “Then2047 Satan entered into him.”</p>
<p>Laughing at him for his shamelessness. As long as he belonged to the band of disciples
he dared not spring upon him, but attacked2048 him from without; but when Christ made
him manifest and separated him, then he sprang upon him without fear. It was not fitting
to keep within one of such a character, and who so long had remained incorrigible.

Wherefore He henceforth cast him out, and then that other seized him when cut off, and
he leaving them went forth by night.2049</p>
<p>“Jesus saith unto him, Friend,2050 that thou doest, do quickly.”</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “Now no man at the table knew with what intent He spake this unto him.”2051</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Wonderful insensibility! How could it be that he was neither softened nor shamed;
but rendered yet more shameless, “went out.” The “do quickly,” is not the expression of one
commanding, nor advising, but of one reproaching, and showing him that He desired to
correct him, but that since he was incorrigible, He let him go. And this, the Evangelist saith,
“no man of those that sat at the table knew.” Some one may perhaps find here a considerable
difficulty, if, when the disciples had asked, “Who is it?” and He had answered, “He to whom
I shall give a sop when I have dipped it,” they did not even so understand; unless indeed He
spake it secretly, so that no man should hear. For John on this very account, leaning by His
breast, asked Him almost close to His ear, so that the traitor might not be made manifest;
and Christ answered in like manner, so that not even then did He discover him. And though
He spake emphatically,2052 “Friend, that thou doest, do quickly,” even so they understood
not. But he spake thus to show that the things were true which had been said by Him to the
Jews concerning His death. For He had said to them, “I have power to lay down My life,
and I have power to take it again”: and, “No man taketh it from Me.” ( c. x. 18.) As long
then as He would retain it, no man was able (to take it); but when He resigned it, then the
action became easy. All this He implied when He said, “That thou doest, do quickly.” Yet
not even then did He expose him,2053 for perhaps the others might have torn him in pieces,
or Peter might have killed him. On this account “no man at the table knew.” Not even John?
Not even he: for he could not have expected that a disciple would arrive2054 at such a pitch
of wickedness. For since they were far from such iniquity themselves, they could not suspect
such things concerning others. As before He had told them, “I speak not of you all” ( ver.
18 ), yet did not reveal the person; so here, they thought that it was said concerning some
other matter.</p>
<p>“It was night,” saith the Evangelist, when he went out. “Why tellest thou me the time?”
That thou mayest learn his forwardness, that not even the time restrained him from his

purpose. Yet not even did this make him quite manifest, for the others were at this time in
confusion, occupied by fear and great distress, and they knew not the true reason of what
had been said but supposed2055 that He spake thus, in order that Judas might give somewhat
to the poor. For He cared greatly for the poor, teaching us also to bestow much diligence
on this thing. But they thought this, not without a cause, but “because he had the bag.” Yet
no one appears to have brought money to Him; that the female disciples nourished Him of
their substance, it has said, but this2056 it hath nowhere intimated. ( Luke viii. 3.) But how
did He who bade His disciples bear neither scrip, nor money, nor staff, Himself bear a bag
to minister to the poor? That thou mayest learn, that it behooveth even him who is exceedingly
needy and crucified, to be very careful on this point. For many things He did in the
way of dispensation2057 for our instruction. The disciples then thought that He said this,
that Judas should give something to the poor; and not even this shamed him, His not being
willing even to the last day to make him a public example. We too ought to do the like, and
not parade the sins of our companions, though they be incurable. For even after this He
gave a kiss to the man who came to betray Him, and endured,2058 such an action as that
was, and then proceeded to a thing of far greater daring,2059 the Cross itself,2060 to the death
of shame, and there again He manifested His lovingkindness. And here He calleth it “glory,”
showing us that there is nothing so shameful and reproachful which makes not brighter
him who goeth to it, if it be done according to the will of God. At least after the going forth
of Judas to the betraying, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “Now is the Son of Man glorified.”2061</p>
<p>In this way rousing the dejected thoughts of the disciples, and persuading them not only
not to despond, but even to rejoice. On this account He rebuked Peter at the first, because
for one who has been in death to overcome death, is great glory. And this is what He said
of Himself, “When I am lifted up,2062 then ye shall know that I Am” ( c. viii. 28 ); and again,
“Destroy this Temple” ( c. ii. 19 ); and again, “No sign shall be given unto you2063 but the
sign of Jonas.” ( Matt. xii. 39.) For how can it be otherwise than great glory, the being able
even after death to do greater things than before death? for in order that the Resurrection

might be believed, the disciples did work greater things. But unless He had lived, and had
been God, how could these men have wrought such things in His Name?</p>
<p>Ver. 32. “And God shall glorify Him.”2064</p>
<p>What is, “And God shall glorify Him in Himself”? It is “by means of2065 Himself, not
by means of another.”</p>
<p>“And shall straightway glorify Him.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> That is, “simultaneously with the Cross.” “For it will not be after much time,” He
saith, “nor will He wait for the distant season of the Resurrection, nor will He then show
Him glorious, but straightway on the Cross itself His glories shall appear.” And so the sun
was darkened,2066 the rocks rent; the veil of the temple was parted asunder, many bodies
of saints that slept arose, the tomb had its seals, the guards sat by, and while a stone lay over
the Body the Body rose; forty days passed by, and the Gift of the Spirit came, and they all
straightway preached Him. This is, “shall glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway
glorify Him”; not by Angels or Archangels, not by any other power, but by Himself. But
how did He also glorify Him by Himself? By doing all for the glory of the Son. Yet the Son
did all. Seest thou that He referreth to the Father the things done by Himself?</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “Little children, yet a little while I am with you—and2067 as I said unto the Jews,
Whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say to you.”</p>
<p>He now begins words of sorrow after the supper. For when Judas went forth it was no
longer evening, but night. But since they2068 were about to come shortly, it was necessary
to set all things before the disciples, that they might have them in remembrance; or rather,
the Spirit recalled all to their minds. For it is likely that they would forget many things, as
hearing for the first time, and being about to undergo such temptations. Men who were
weighed down to sleep, (as another Evangelist saith,— Luke xxii. 45 ,) who were possessed
by despondency, as Christ saith Himself, “Because I have said these things unto you, sorrow
hath filled your hearts” ( c. xvi. 6 ), how could they retain all these things exactly? Why then
were they spoken? It became no little gain to them with respect to their opinion of2069 Christ,
that in after times when reminded2070 they certainly knew that they had long ago heard
these things from Christ. But wherefore doth He first cast down their souls, saying, “Yet a
little while I am with you”? “To the Jews indeed it was said with reason, but wherefore dost

Thou place us in just the same class with those obstinate ones?” He by no means did so.
“Why then said He, ‘As I said to the Jews’?” He reminded them that He did not now, because
troubles were upon them, warn them of these things, but that He had foreknown them from
the first, and that they were witnesses who had heard that He had said these things to the
Jews. Wherefore He added also the word, “little children,” that when they heard, “As I said
to the Jews,” they might not deem that the expression was used in like sense towards themselves.
It was not then to depress but to comfort them that He thus spake, that their dangers
might not, by coming upon them suddenly, trouble them to excess.</p>
<p>“Whither I go, ye cannot come.” He showeth that His death is a removal, and a change
for the better2071 to a place which admits not corruptible bodies. This He saith, both to excite
their love towards Him, and to make it more fervent. Ye know that when we see any of our
dearest friends departing from us, our affection is warmest, and the more so, when we see
them going to a place to which it is not even possible for us to go. These things then He said,
terrifying the Jews, but kindling longing in the disciples. “Such is the place, that not only
not they, but not even you, My best beloved, can come there.” Here He showeth also His
Own dignity.</p>
<p>“So now I say to you.” Why “now”? “In one way to them, to you in another way”; that
is, “not with them.” But when did the Jews seek Him, when the disciples? The disciples,
when they fled the Jews, when they suffered miseries unendurable and surpassing all description
at the capture of their city, when the wrath of God was borne down upon them from
every side. To the Jews therefore He2072 spake then, because of their unbelief, “but to you
now, that troubles might not come upon you unexpected.”</p>
<p>Ver. 34. “A new commandment I give unto you.”2073</p>
<p>For since it was likely that they would be troubled when they heard these things, as
though they were about to be deserted, He comforteth them, investing them with that which
was the root of all blessings and a safeguard, love. As though He had said, “Grieve ye at My
departure? Nay, if ye love one another, ye shall be the stronger.” Why then said He not this?
Because He said what profited them more than this.</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples.”2074</p>
<p><del>5.</del> By this He at the same time showed that the company2075 should never be extinguished,
when He gave them a distinguishing token. This He said when the traitor was cut
off from them. But how calleth He that a new commandment which is contained also in the

Old (covenant)? He made it new Himself by the manner; therefore He added, “As I have
loved you.” “I have not paid back to you a debt of good deeds first done by you, but Myself
have begun,” He saith. “And so ought you to benefit your dearest ones, though you owe
them nothing”; and omitting to speak of the miracles which they should do, He maketh
their characteristic, love. And why? Because it is this which chiefly shows men holy; it is the
foundation of all virtue; by this mostly we are all even saved. For “this,” He saith, “is to be
a disciple; so shall all men praise you, when they see you imitating My Love.” What then?
Do not miracles much more show this? By no means. For “many will say, Lord, have we not
in Thy Name cast out devils?” ( Matt. vii. 22.) And again, when they rejoice that the devils
obey them, He saith, “Rejoice not that the devils obey2076 you, but that your names are
written in heaven.” ( Luke x. 20.) And2077 this indeed brought over the world, because
that2078 was before it; had not that been, neither would this have endured. This then
straightway made them perfect,2079 the having2080 all one heart and one soul. But had they
separated one from the other, all things would have been lost.</p>
<p>Now He spake this not to them only, but to all who should believe on Him; since even
now, there is nothing else that causes the heathen2081 to stumble, except that there is no
love. “But,” saith some one, “they also urge against us the absence of miracles.” But not in
the same way. “But where did the Apostles manifest their love?” Seest thou Peter and John
inseparable from one another, and going up to the Temple? ( Acts iii. 1.) Seest thou Paul
disposed in a like way towards them, and dost thou doubt? If they had gained the other
blessings, much more had they the mother of them all. For this is a thing that springs from
a virtuous soul; but where wickedness is, there the plant withers away. For “when,”2082 it
saith, “iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” ( Matt. xxiv. 12.) And miracles
do not so much attract the heathen as the mode of life; and nothing so much causes a right
life as love. For those who wrought miracles they often even called deceivers; but they could
have no hold upon a pure life. While then the message of the Gospel was not yet spread
abroad, miracles were with good reason marveled at, but now men must get to be admired
by their lives. For nothing so raises respect in the heathen as virtue, nothing so offends them

as vice. And with good reason. When one of them sees the greedy man, the plunderer, exhorting
others to do the contrary, when he sees the man who was commanded to love even
his enemies, treating his very kindred like brutes, he will say that the words are folly. When
he sees one trembling at death, how will he receive the accounts of immortality? When he
sees us fond of rule, and slaves to the other passions, he will more firmly remain in his own
doctrines, forming no high opinion of us. We, we are the cause of their remaining in their
error. Their own doctrines they have long condemned, and in like manner they admire ours,
but they are hindered by our mode of life. To follow wisdom in talk is easy, many among
themselves have done this; but they require the proof by works. “Then let them look to the
ancients of our profession.” But about them they by no means believe; they enquire concerning
those now living. For, “show me,” it saith, “thy faith by thy works”2083 ( Jas. ii. 18 ); but
this is not the case; on the contrary, seeing us tear our neighbors worse than any wild beast,
they call us the curse of the world. These things restrain the heathen, and suffer them not
to come over to our side. So that we shall be punished for these also; not only for what we
do amiss ourselves, but because the name of God is blasphemed. How long shall we be given
up to wealth, and luxury, and the other passions? For the future let us leave them. Hear what
the Prophet saith of certain foolish ones, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” ( Isa.
xxii. 31.) But in the present case we cannot even say this,2084 so “many” gather round
themselves what belongs to all. So chiding them also, the Prophet said, “Will ye dwell alone
upon the earth?” ( Isa. v. 8.) Wherefore I fear lest some grievous thing come to pass, and we
draw down upon us heavy vengeance from God. And that this may not come to pass, let us
be careful of2085 all virtue, that we may obtain the future blessings, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the
Holy Ghost, be glory now and forever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>“Simon Peter said unto Him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go
thou canst not follow Me now, but thou shalt follow Me afterwards.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A great thing2086 is love, and stronger than fire itself, and it goeth up to the very
heaven; there is2087 no hindrance which can restrain its tearing2088 force. And so the most
fervent Peter, when he hears, “Whither I go ye cannot come,” what saith he? “Lord, whither
goest thou?” and this he said, not so much from wish to learn, as from desire to follow. To
say openly, “I go,” he dared not yet, but, “Whither goest thou?” Christ answered, not to his
words, but to his thoughts. For that this was his wish, is clear from what Christ said,
“Whither I go thou canst not follow Me now.” Seest thou that he longed for the following
Him, and therefore asked the question? And when he heard, “thou shalt follow Me afterwards,”
not even so did he restrain his longing, and, though he had gained good hopes, he
is so eager as to say,</p>

<p>When he had shaken off the dread of being the traitor, and was shown to be one of His
own,2089 he afterwards asked boldly himself, while the others held their peace. “What sayest
thou, Peter? He said, ‘thou canst not,’ and thou sayest, ‘I can’? Therefore thou shalt know
from this temptation that thy love is nothing without the presence of the impulse2090 from
above.” Whence it is clear that in care for him He allowed even that fall. He desired indeed
to teach him even by the first words, but when he continued in his vehemence, He did not
indeed throw or force him into the denial, but left him alone, that he might learn his own
weakness. Christ had said that He must be betrayed; Peter replied, “Be it far from Thee,
Lord; this shall not happen unto Thee.” ( Matt. xvi. 22.) He was rebuked, but not instructed.
On the contrary, when Christ desired to wash his feet, he said, “Thou shalt never wash my
feet.”2091 ( Ver. 8.) Again, when he hears, “Thou canst not follow Me now,” he saith, “Though
all deny Thee, I will not deny Thee.” Since then it was likely that he would be lifted up to

folly by his practice of contradiction, Jesus next teacheth him not to oppose Him. This too
Luke implies, when he telleth us that Christ said, “And I have prayed for thee, that thy faith
fail not” ( Luke xxii. 32 ); that is, “that thou be not finally lost.” In every way teaching him
humility, and proving that human nature by itself is nothing. But, since great love made
him apt for contradiction, He now sobereth him, that he might not in after times be subject
to this, when he should have received the stewardship of the world, but remembering what
he had suffered, might know himself. And look at the violence of his fall; it did not happen
to him once or twice, but he was so beside himself, that in a short time thrice did he utter
the words of denial, that he might learn that he did not so love as he was loved. And yet, to
one who had so fallen He saith again, “Lovest thou Me more than these?” So that the denial
was caused not by the cooling of his love, but from his having been stripped of aid from
above. He accepteth then Peter’s love, but cutteth off the spirit of contradiction engendered
by it. “For if thou lovest, thou oughtest to obey Him who is beloved. I said2092 to thee and
to those with thee, ‘Thou canst not’; why art thou contentious? Knowest thou what a thing
it is to contradict God? But since thou wilt not learn in this way that it is impossible that
what I say should not come to pass, thou shalt learn2093 it in the denial.” And yet this appeared
to thee to be much more incredible. For this thou did not even understand, but of
that thou hadst the knowledge2094 in thy heart. Yet still that came to pass which was not
even2095 expected.</p>
<p>“I will lay down my life for Thee.” For since he had heard, “Greater love than this hath,
no man,”2096 he straightway sprang forward, insatiably eager and desirous to reach even to
the highest pitch of virtue. But Christ, to show that it belonged to Himself alone to promise
these things with authority, saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 38. “Before the cock crow.”2097</p>
<p>That is, “now”; there was but a little interval. He spake when it was late at night, and
the first and second watch was past.</p>
<p>Chap. xiv. ver. 1. “Let not your heart be troubled.”</p>
<p>This He saith, because it was probable that when they heard they would be troubled.
For if the leader of their band, one so entirely fervent, was told that before the cock crew he
should thrice deny his Master, it was likely that they would expect to have to undergo some

great reverse, sufficient to bend even souls of adamant. Since then it was probable that they
considering these things would be astounded, see how He comforteth them, saying, “Let
not your heart be troubled.” By this first word showing the power of His Godhead, because,
what they had in their hearts He knew and brought to light.</p>
<p>“Ye believe in God, believe also in Me.” That is, “All dangers shall pass you by, for faith
in Me and in My Father is more powerful than the things which come upon you, and will
permit no evil thing to prevail against you.” Then He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “In My Father’s house are many mansions.”</p>
<p>As He comforteth Peter when bewildered2098 by saying, “but thou shalt follow afterwards,”
so also He gives this glimpse of hope to the others. For lest they should think that
the promise was given to him alone, He saith, “In My Father’s house are many mansions.”</p>
<p>“If it were not so I would have said to you, I go2099 to prepare a place for you.”</p>
<p>That is, “The same place which receiveth Peter shall receive you.” For a great abundance
of dwellings is there, and it may not be said that they need preparation. When He said, “Ye
cannot follow Me now,” that they might not deem that they were finally cut off, He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 3.2100 “That where I am, there ye may be also.” “So earnest have I been concerning
this matter,2101 that I should already have been given up to it,2102 had not preparation been
made long ago for you.” Showing them that they ought to be very bold and confident. Then
that He may not seem to speak as though enticing them, but that they may believe the thing
to be so, He addeth,</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 4. “And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that He giveth them proof that these things were not said without a meaning?
And He used these words, because He knew in Himself that their souls now desired to learn
this. For Peter said what he said, not in order to learn, but that he might follow. But when
Peter had been rebuked, and Christ had declared2103 that to be possible which for the time
seemed impossible,2104 and when the apparent impossibility led him to desire to know the
matter exactly, therefore He saith to the others, “And the way ye know.” For as when He
hath said, “Thou shalt deny Me,” before any one spake a word, searching into their hearts,

He said, “Be not troubled,” so here also by saying “Ye know,” He disclosed the desire which
was in their heart, and Himself giveth them an excuse for questioning. Now the, “Whither
goest Thou?” Peter used from a very loving affection, Thomas from cowardice.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “Lord,2105 we know not whither Thou goest.”2106</p>
<p>“The place,” he saith, “we know not, and how shall we know the way leading thither?”
And observe with what submissiveness he speaks; he saith not, “tell us the place,” but, “we
know not whither Thou goest”; for all had long yearned to hear this. If the Jews questioned
among themselves when they heard (of His departure), although desirous to be rid of Him,
much more would those desire to learn, who wished never to be separated from Him. They
feared therefore to ask Him, but yet they asked Him, from their great love and anxiety. What
then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but
by Me.”</p>
<p>“Why then, when He was asked by Peter, ‘Whither goest Thou,’ did He not say directly,
‘I go to the Father, but ye cannot come now’? Why did He put in a circuit of so many words,
placing together questions and answers? With good reason He told not this to the Jews; but
why not to these?” He had indeed said both to these and to the Jews, that He came forth
from God, and was going to God, now He saith the same thing more clearly than before.
Besides, to the Jews He spake not so clearly; for had He said, “Ye cannot come to the Father
but by Me,” they would straightway have deemed the matter mere boasting; but now by
concealing this, He threw them2107 into perplexity. “But why,” saith some one, “did He
speak thus both to the disciples and to Peter?” He knew his great forwardness, and that he
would by reason of this2108 the more press on and trouble Him; in order therefore to lead
him away, He hideth the matter. Having then succeeded in what He wished by the obscurity
and by veiling His speech, He again discloseth the matter. After saying, “Where I am, no
man can come,” He addeth, “In My Father’s house are many mansions”; and again, “No
man cometh to the Father but by Me.” This He would not tell them at first, in order not to
throw them into greater despondency, but, now that He hath soothed them, He telleth them.
For by Peter’s rebuke He cast out2109 much of their despondency; and dreading lest they
should be addressed in the same way, they were the more restrained. “I am the Way.” This
is the proof of the, “No man cometh to the Father but by Me”;2110 and, “the Truth, and the

Life,” of this, “that these things shall surely be.” “There is then no falsehood with Me, if I
am ‘the Truth’; if I am ‘Life’ also, not even death shall be able to hinder you from coming
to Me. Besides; if I am ‘the Way,’ ye will need none to lead you by the hand; if I am also ‘the
Truth,’ My words are no falsehoods; if I am also ‘Life,’ though ye die ye shall obtain what I
have told you.” Now His being “the Way,” they both understood and allowed, but the rest
they knew not. They did not indeed venture to say what they knew not. Still they gained
great consolation from His being “the Way.” “If,” saith He, “I have sole authority to bring2111
to the Father, ye shall surely come thither; for neither is it possible to come by any other
way.” But by saying before, “No man can come to Me except the Father draw him”; and
again, “If I be lifted up from the earth, I shall draw all men unto Me” ( c. xii. 32 ); and again,
“No man cometh to the Father but by Me” ( c. xiv. 6 ); He showeth Himself equal to Him
who begat Him. But how after saying, “Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know,” hath
He added,</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also; and from henceforth
ye know Him, and have seen Him”?</p>
<p>He doth not contradict Himself; they knew Him indeed, but not so as they ought. God
they knew, but the Father not yet. For afterwards, the Spirit having come upon them
wrought2112 in them all knowledge. What He saith is of this kind. “Had ye known My Essence
and My Dignity, ye would have known that of the Father also; and henceforth ye shall know
Him, and have seen Him,” (the one belonging to the future, the other to the present,) that
is, “by Me.” By “sight,” He meaneth knowledge by intellectual perception. For those who
are seen we may see and not know; but those who are known we cannot know and not know.
Wherefore He saith, “and ye have seen Him”; just as it saith, “was seen also of Angels.” ( 1
Tim. iii. 16.) Yet the very Essence was not seen; yet it saith that He “was seen,” that is, as far
as it was possible for them to see. These words are used, that thou mayest learn that2113 the
man who hath seen Him2114 knoweth Him who begat Him. But they beheld Him not in
His unveiled Essence, but clothed with flesh. He is wont elsewhere to put “sight” for
“knowledge”; as when He saith, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” (
Matt. v. 8.) By “pure,” He meaneth not those who are free from fornication only, but from
all sins. For every sin brings filth upon the soul.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then use every means to wipe off the filthiness. But first the font cleanseth,
afterwards other ways also, many and of all kinds. For God, being merciful, hath even after

<note type="footnote">2113 al. “showing that.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2114 the Son.</note>

<pb n="529"/>
this2115 given to us various ways of2116 reconciliation, of all which the first is that by almsdoing.
“By alms-deeds,” it saith, “and deeds of faith sins are cleansed away.” ( Ecclus. iii.
30.) By alms-doing I do not mean that which is maintained by injustice, for this is not almsdoing,
but savageness and inhumanity. What profits it to strip one man and clothe another?
For we ought to begin the action with mercy, but this is inhumanity. If we give away
everything that we have got from other people, it is no gain to us. And this Zacchæus shows,
who on that occasion said, that he propitiated God by giving four times as much as he had
taken. ( Luke xix. 8.) But we, when we plunder unboundedly, and give but little, think that
we make God propitious, whereas we do rather2117 exasperate Him. For tell me, if thou
shouldest drag a dead and rotten ass from the waysides and lanes, and bring it to the altar,
would not all stone thee as accursed and polluted?2118 Well then, if I prove that a sacrifice
procured by plunder is more polluted than this, what defense shall we obtain? Let us suppose
that some article has been obtained by plunder, is it not of fouler scent than a dead ass?
Wouldest thou learn how great is the rottenness of sin? Hear the Prophet saying, “My wounds
stank, and were corrupt.” ( Ps. xxxviii. 5 , LXX.) And dost thou in words entreat God to
forget thy misdeeds, and dost thou by what thou thyself doest, robbing and grasping, and
placing thy sin upon the altar, cause Him to remember them continually? But now, this is
not the only sin, but there is one more grievous than this, that thou defilest the souls of the
saints.2119 For the altar is but a stone, and is consecrated, but they ever bear with them
Christ Himself; and darest thou to send thither any of such impurity? “No,” saith one, “not
the same money, but other.” Mockery this, and trifling. Knowest thou not, that if one drop
of injustice fall on a great quantity of wealth, the whole is defiled? And just as a man by
casting dung into a pure fountain makes it all unclean, so also in the case of riches, anything
ill-gotten entering in makes them to be tainted with the ill savor from itself. Then we wash
our hands when we enter into church, but our hearts not so. Why, do our hands send forth
a voice? It is the soul that utters2120 the words: to that God looketh; cleanness of the body
is of no use, while that is defiled. What profits it, if thou wipe clean thine outward hands,
while thou hast those within impure? For the terrible thing and that which subverts all good
is this, that while we are fearful about trifles, we care not for important matters. To pray
with unwashed hands is a matter indifferent; but to do it with an unwashed mind, this is
the extreme of all evils. Hear what was said to the Jews who busied themselves about such
<note type="footnote">2115 after baptism.</note>

outward impurities. “Wash thine heart from wickedness, how long shall there be in thee
thoughts of thy labors?”2121 ( Jer. iv. 14.) Let us also wash ourselves, not with mire, but with
fair water, with alms-doing, not with covetousness. First get free from rapine, and then show
forth alms-deeds. Let us “decline from evil, and do good.” ( Ps. xxxvii. 27.) Stay thy hands
from covetousness, and so bring them to alms-giving. But if with the same hands we strip
one set of persons,2122 though we may not clothe the others with what has been taken2123
from them, yet we shall not thus escape punishment. For that which is the groundwork2124
of the propitiation is made the groundwork of all wickedness. Better not show mercy, than
show it thus; since for Cain also it had been better not to have2125 brought his offering at
all. Now if he who brought too little angered God, when one gives what is another’s, how
shall not he anger Him? “I commanded thee,” He will say, “not to steal, and honorest thou
Me from that thou hast stolen? What thinkest thou? That I am pleased with these things?”
Then shall He say to thee, “Thou thoughtest wickedly that I am even such an one as thyself;
I will rebuke thee, and set before thy face thy sins.” ( Ps. l. 21 , LXX.) But may it not come
to pass that any one of us hear this voice, but having wrought pure alms-deeds, and having
our lamps burning, so may we enter into the bride-chamber by the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost2126 be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiv. 8, 9</p>
<p>“Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him,
Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He who hath
seen Me, hath seen the Father.”2127</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The Prophet said to the Jews, “Thou hadst the countenance of a harlot, thou wert
shameless towards all men.” ( Jer. iii. 3 , LXX.) Now it seems fitting to use this expression
not only against that city,2128 but against all who shamelessly set their faces against the truth.
For when Philip said to Christ, “Show us the Father,” He replied, “Have I been so long time
with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip?” And yet there are some Who even after
these words separate the Father from the Son. What proximity dost thou require closer than
this? Indeed from this very saying some have fallen into the malady of Sabellius. But let us,
leaving both these and those as involved in directly opposite error, consider the exact
meaning of the words. “Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me,
Philip?” He saith. What then? replieth Philip, “Art thou the Father after whom I enquire?”
“No,” He saith. On this account He said not, “hast thou not known Him,” but, “hast thou
not known Me,” declaring nothing else but this, that the Son is no other than what the
Father is, yet continuing to be a Son. But how came Philip to ask this question? Christ had
said, “If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also” ( c. xiv. 7 ), and He had
often said the same to the Jews. Since then Peter and the Jews had often asked Him, “Who
is the Father?” since Thomas had asked Him, and no one had learnt anything clear, but His
words were still not understood; Philip, in order that He might not seem to be importunate
and to trouble Him by asking in his turn after the Jews, “Show us the Father,” added, “and
it sufficeth us,” “we seek no more.” Yet Christ had said, “If ye had known Me, ye should
have known My Father also,” and by Himself He declared the Father. But Philip reversed
the order, and said, “Show us the Father,” as though knowing Christ exactly. But Christ
endureth him not, but putteth him in the right way, persuading him to gain the knowledge
of the Father through Himself, while Philip desired to see Him with these bodily eyes, having
perhaps heard concerning the Prophets, that they “saw God.” But those cases, Philip, were
acts of condescension. Wherefore Christ said, “No man hath seen God at any time” ( c. i.
18 ); and again, “Every man that hath heard and hath learned from God cometh unto Me.”
( c. vi. 45.) “Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape.” ( c. v. 37.)
And in the Old Testament, “No man shall see My face, and live.” ( Ex. xxxiii. 20.) What saith

<pb n="532"/>
Christ? Very reprovingly He saith, “Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not
known Me, Philip?” He said not, “hast thou not seen,” but, “hast thou not known Me.”
“Why,” Philip might say, “do I wish to learn concerning Thee? At present I seek to see Thy
Father, and Thou sayest unto me, hast thou not known Me?” What connection then hath
this with the question? Surely a very close one; for if He is that which the Father is, yet
continuing a Son, with reason He showeth in Himself Him who begat Him. Then to distinguish
the Persons He saith, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,” lest any one should
assert that the same is Father, the same Son. For had He been the Father, He would not have
said, “He that hath seen Me hath seen Him.” Why then did He not reply, “thou askest things
impossible, and not allowed to man; to Me alone is this possible”? Because Philip had said,
“it sufficeth us,” as though knowing Christ, He showeth that he had not even seen Him. For
assuredly he would have known the Father, had he been able to know the Son.2129 Wherefore
He saith, “He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.” “If any one hath seen Me, he shall
also behold Him.” What He saith is of this kind: “It is not possible to see either Me or Him.”
For Philip sought the knowledge which is by sight, and since he thought that he had so seen
Christ, he desired in like manner to see the Father; but Jesus showeth him that he had not
even seen Himself. And if any one here call knowledge, sight, I do not contradict him, for,
“he that hath known Me,” saith Christ, “hath known the Father.” Yet He did not say this,
but desiring to establish the Consubstantiality, declared, “he that knoweth My Essence,
knoweth that of the Father also.” “And what is this?” saith some one; “for he who is acquainted
with creation knoweth also God.” Yet all are acquainted with creation, and have seen
it, but all do not know God. Besides, let us consider what Philip seeks to see. Is it the wisdom
of the Father? Is it His goodness? Not so, but the very whatever God is, the very Essence.
To this therefore Christ answereth, “He that hath seen Me.” Now he that hath seen the creation,
hath not also seen the Essence of God. “If any one hath seen Me, he hath seen the
Father,” He saith. Now had He been of a different Essence, He would not have spoken thus.
But to make use of a grosser argument, no man that knows not what gold is, can discern
the substance of gold in silver. For one nature is not shown by another. Wherefore He rightly
rebuked him, saying, “Am I so long with you?” Hast thou enjoyed such teaching, hast thou
seen miracles wrought with authority, and all belonging to the Godhead, which the Father
alone worketh, sins forgiven, secrets published, death retreating, a creation wrought from
earth,2130 and hast thou not known Me? Because He was clothed with flesh, therefore He
said, “Hast thou not known Me?”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Thou hast seen the Father; seek not to see more; for in Him thou hast seen Me. If
thou hast seen Me, be not over-curious; for thou hast also in Me known Him.</p>

<p>Ver. 10. “Believest thou not that I am in the Father?”2131</p>
<p>That is, “I am seen in that Essence.”</p>
<p>“The words that I speak, I speak not of Myself,”</p>
<p>Seest thou the exceeding nearness, and the proof of the one Essence?</p>
<p>“The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.”</p>
<p>How, beginning with words, doth He come to works? for that which naturally followed
was, that He should say, “the Father speaketh the words.” But He putteth two things here,
both concerning doctrine and miracles. Or it may have been because the words also were
works. How then doeth He2132 them? In another place He saith, “If I do not the works of
My Father, believe Me not.” ( c. x. 37.) How then saith He here that the Father doeth them?
To show this same thing, that there is no interval between the Father and the Son. What He
saith is this: “The Father would not act in one way, and I in another.” Indeed in another
place both He and the Father work; “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work” ( c. v. 17 );
showing in the first passage the unvaryingness of the works,2133 in the second the identity.
And if the obvious meaning of the words denotes humility, marvel not; for after having first
said, “Believest thou not?” He then spake thus, showing that He so modeled His words to
bring him to the faith; for He walked in their hearts.</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “Believe2134 that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.”</p>
<p>“Ye ought not, when ye hear of ‘Father’ and ‘Son,’ to seek anything else to the establishing
of the relationship2135 as to Essence, but if this is not sufficient to prove to you the Condignity
and Consubstantiality, ye may learn it even from the works.” Had the, “he that hath seen
Me, hath seen My Father,” been used with respect to works, He would not afterwards have
said,</p>
<p>“Or else believe Me for the very works’ sake.” And then to show that He is not only able
to do these things, but also other much greater than these, He putteth them with excess. For
He saith not, “I can do greater things than these,” but, what was much more wonderful, “I
can give to others also to do greater things than these.”</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall
he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to the Father.”</p>
<p>That is, “it now remaineth for you to work miracles, for I go away.” Then when He had
accomplished what His argument intended, He saith,</p>

<p>Ver. 13. “Whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be
glorified in Me.”</p>
<p>Seest thou again that it is He who doeth it? “I,” saith He, “will do it”; not, “I will ask of
the Father,” but, “that the Father may be glorified in Me.” In another place He said, “God
shall glorify Him in Himself” ( c. xiii. 32 ), but here, “He shall glorify the Father”; for when
the Son shall appear with great power, He who begat shall be glorified. But what is, “in My
Name”? That which the Apostles said, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, arise and walk.” ( Acts
iii. 6.) For all the miracles which they did He wrought in them, and “the hand of the Lord
was with them.” ( Acts xi. 21.)</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “I will do2136 it,” He saith.</p>
<p>Seest thou His authority? The things done by means of others Himself doeth; hath He
no power for the things done by Himself, except as being wrought in by the Father? And
who could say this? But why doth He put it second? To confirm His own words, and to
show that the former sayings were of condescension. But the, “I go to the Father,” is this: “I
shall not perish, but remain in My own proper Dignity, and Am in Heaven.” All this He
said, comforting them. For since it was likely that they, not yet understanding His discourses
concerning the Resurrection, would imagine something dismal, He in other discourses
promiseth that He will give them such things, soothing them in every way, and showing
that He abideth continually; and not only abideth, but that He will even show forth greater
power.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then follow Him, and take up the Cross. For though persecution be not
present, yet the season for another kind of death is with us. “Mortify,” it saith, “your members
which are upon earth.” ( Col. iii. 5.) Let us then quench concupiscence, slay anger, abolish
envy. This is a “living sacrifice.” ( Rom. xii. 1.) This sacrifice ends not in ashes, is not dispersed
in smoke, wants neither wood, nor fire, nor knife. For it hath both fire and a knife, even the
Holy Spirit. Using this knife, circumcise the superfluous and alien portion of thy heart; open
the closedness of thine ears, for vices2137 and evil desires are wont to stop the way against
the entrance of the word. The desire of money, when it is set before one, permits not to hear
the word concerning almsgiving; and malice when it is present raises a wall against the
teaching concerning love; and some other malady falling on in its turn, makes the soul yet
more dull to all things. Let us then do away these wicked desires; it is enough to have willed,
and all are quenched. For let us not, I entreat, look to this, that the love of wealth is a tyrannical
thing, but that the tyranny is that of our own slackmindedness. Many indeed say that
they do not even know what money is. For this desire is not a natural one; such as are natural
were implanted in us from the first, from the beginning, but as for gold and silver, for
<note type="footnote">2136 “If ye shall ask anything in My Name, I,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2137 lit. “maladies.”</note>

<pb n="535"/>
a long time not even what it is was known. Whence then grew this desire? From vainglory
and extreme slackmindedness. For of desires some are necessary, some natural, some neither
the one nor the other. For example, those which if not gratified destroy the creature are both
natural and necessary, as the desire of meat and drink and sleep; carnal desire is natural indeed
but not necessary, for many have got the better of it, and have not died. But the desire
of wealth is neither natural nor necessary, but superfluous; and if we choose we need not
admit its beginning. At any rate, Christ speaking of virginity saith, “He that is able to receive
it, let him receive it.” ( Matt. xix. 12.) But concerning riches not so, but how? “Except a man
forsake all that he hath, he is not worthy of Me.” ( Luke xiv. 33.) What was easy He recommended,
but what goes beyond the many He leaveth to choice. Why then do we deprive
ourselves of all excuse? The man who is made captive by some more tyrannical passion shall
not suffer a heavy punishment, but he who is subdued by a weak one is deprived of all defense.
For what shall we reply when He saith, “Ye saw Me hungry and fed Me not”? ( Matt. xxv.
42 ); what excuse shall we have? We shall certainly plead poverty; yet we are not poorer than
that widow, who by throwing in two mites overshot all the rest. For God requireth not the
quantity of the offering, but the measure of the mind; and that He doth so, comes from His
tender care. Let us then, admiring His lovingkindness, contribute what is in our power, that
having both in this life and in that which is to come obtained in abundance the lovingkindness
of God, we may be able to enjoy the good things promised to us, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiv. 15–17</p>
<p>“If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you
another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth, whom
the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.”2138</p>
<p><del>1.</del> We need everywhere works and actions, not a mere show of words. For to say and
to promise is easy for any one, but to act is not equally easy. Why have I made these remarks?
Because there are many at this time who say that they fear and love God, but in their works
show the contrary; but God requireth that love which is shown by works. Wherefore He
said to the disciples, “If ye love Me, keep My commandments.” For after He had told them,
“Whatsoever ye shall ask,2139 I will do it,” that they might not deem the mere “asking” to
be availing, He added, “If ye love Me,” “then,” He saith, “I will do it.” And since it was likely
that they would be troubled when they heard that, “I go2140 to the Father,” He telleth them
“to be troubled now is not to love, to love is to obey My words. I have given you a commandment
that ye love one another, that ye do so to each other as I have done to you; this is love,
to obey these My words, and to yield to Him who is the object of your love.”</p>
<p>“And I will ask the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.” Again His speech
is one of condescension. For since it was probable, that they not yet knowing Him would
eagerly seek His society, His discourse, His presence in the flesh, and would admit of no
consolation when He was absent, what saith He? “I will ask the Father, and He shall give
you another Comforter,” that is, “Another like unto Me.” Let those be ashamed who have
the disease of Sabellius,2141 who hold not the fitting opinion concerning the Spirit. For the
marvel of this discourse is this, that it hath stricken down contradictory heresies with the
same blow. For by saying “another,” He showeth the difference of Person, and by “Paraclete,”
the connection of Substance. But why said He, “I will ask the Father”? Because had He said,
“I will send Him,” they would not have so much believed and now the object is that He
should be believed. For afterwards He declares that He Himself sendeth Him, saying, “Receive
ye the Holy Ghost” ( c. xx. 22 ); but in this place He telleth them that He asketh the Father,
so as to render His discourse credible to them. Since John saith of Him, “Of His fullness
have all we received” ( c. i. 16 ); but what He had, how receiveth He from another? And
<note type="footnote">2138 “But ye know Him, for He dwelleth with you, and shall be with you.” N.T.</note>

<note type="footnote">2140 al. “depart.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2141 Sabellius was a bishop in Upper Egypt in the third century. The heresy which bears his name denies the
Personality of the Son and the Holy Spirit, and holds that they are manifestations or characters of the Godhead.</note>

again, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.” ( Luke iii. 16.) “But what
had He more than the Apostles, if He was about to ask It of His Father in order to give It to
others, when they often even without prayer appear to have done thus?” And how,2142 if It
is sent according to request from the Father, doth It descend of Itself? And how is that which
is everywhere present sent by Another, that which “divideth to every man severally as He
will” ( 1 Cor. xii. 11 ), and which saith with authority, “Separate Me Paul and Barnabas”? (
Acts xiii. 2.) Those ministers were ministering unto God, yet still It called them authoritatively
to Its own work; not that It called them to any different work, but in order to show Its power.
“What then,” saith some one, “is, ‘I will ask the Father’?” (He saith it) to show the time of
Its coming. For when He had cleansed them by the sacrifice,2143 then the Holy Ghost lighted
upon them. “And why, while He was with them, came it not?” Because the sacrifice was not
yet offered. But when afterwards sin had been loosed, and they were being sent forth to
dangers, and were stripping themselves for the contest, then need was that the Anointer2144
should come. “But why did not the Spirit come immediately after the Resurrection?” In order
that being greatly desirous of It, they might receive It with great joy. For as long as Christ
was with them, they were not in tribulation; but when He departed, being made defenseless
and thrown into much fear, they would receive It with much readiness.</p>
<p>“He remaineth with you.” This showeth that even after death It departeth not. But lest
when they heard of the “Paraclete,” they should imagine a second Incarnation, and expect
to see It with their eyes, He setteth them right by saying, “Whom the world cannot receive,
because it seeth Him not.” “He will not be with you as I have been, but will dwell in your
very souls”; for this is the, “shall be in you.”2145 He calleth it the “Spirit of truth”; thus explaining
the types in the Old Testament. “That He may be2146 with you.” What is, “may be
with you”? That which He saith Himself, that “I am with you.” ( Matt. xxviii. 20.) Besides,
He also implieth something else, that “the case of the Spirit shall not be the same as Mine,
He shall never leave you.” “Whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not.”
“Why, what is there belonging to the other Persons that is visible?” Nothing; but He speaketh
here of knowledge; at least He addeth, “neither knoweth Him.” For He is wont, in the case
of exact knowledge, to call it “sight”; because sight is clearer than the other senses, by this
He always representeth exact knowledge. By “world,” He here speaketh of “the wicked,”
thus too comforting the disciples by giving to them a special gift. See in how many particulars
He raised His discourse concerning It. He said, “He is Another like unto Me”; He said, “He

will not leave you”; He said, “Unto you alone He cometh, as also did I”; He said, that “He
remaineth in you”; but not even so did He drive out their despondency. For they still sought
Him and His society. To cure then this feeling, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “I will not leave you orphans, I will come unto you.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “Fear not,” He saith, “I said not that I would send you another Comforter, as though
I were Myself withdrawing from you for ever; I said not that He remaineth with you, as
though I should see you no more. For I also Myself will come to you, I will not leave you
orphans.” Because when commencing He said, “Little children,” therefore He saith also
here, “I will not leave you orphans.” At first then He told them, “Ye shall come whither I
go”; and, “In My Father’s house there are many mansions”; but here, since that time was
long, He giveth them the Spirit; and when, not knowing what it could be of which He spoke,
they were not sufficiently comforted, “I will not leave you orphans,” He saith; for this they
chiefly required. But since the, “I will come to you,” was the saying of one declaring a
“presence,” observe how in order that they might not again seek for the same kind of presence
as before, He did not clearly tell them this thing, but hinted at it; for having said,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Yet a little while, and the world seeth Me not”; He added, “but ye see Me.”</p>
<p>As though He had said, “I come indeed to you, but not in the same way as before, ever
being with you day by day.” And lest they should say, “How then saidst Thou to the Jews,
Henceforth ye shall not see Me?” He solveth the contradiction by saying, “to you alone”;
for such also is the nature of the Spirit.</p>
<p>“Because I live, ye shall live also.”</p>
<p>For the Cross doth not finally separate us, but only hideth for a little moment; and by
“life” He seemeth to me to mean not the present only, but the future also.</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “At that day ye shall know that am in the2147 Father, and you in Me, and I in
you.”</p>
<p>With regard to the Father, these words refer to Essence; with regard to the disciples, to
agreement of mind and help from God. “And how, tell me, is this reasonable?” saith some
one. And how, pray, is the contrary reasonable? For great and altogether boundless is the
interval between Christ and the disciples. And if the same words are employed, marvel not;
for the Scripture is often wont to use in different senses the same words, when applied to
God and to men. Thus we are called “gods,” and “sons of God,” yet the word hath not the
same force when applied to us and to God. And the Son is called “Image,” and “Glory”; so
are we, but great is the interval between us. Again, “Ye are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s” (
1 Cor. iii. 23 ), but not in like manner as Christ is God’s are we Christ’s. But what is it that
He saith? “When I am arisen,” He saith, “ye shall know that I am not separated from the
Father, but have the same power with Him, and that I am with you continually, when facts
<note type="footnote">2147 “My,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="539"/>
proclaim the aid which cometh to you from Me, when your enemies are kept down, and
you speak boldly, when dangers are removed from your path, when the preaching of the
Gospel flourisheth day by day, when all yield and give ground to the word of true religion.
“As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you.” ( c. xx. 21.) Seest thou that here also the word
hath not the same force? for if we take it as though it had, the Apostles will differ in nothing
from Christ. But why saith He, “Then ye shall know”? Because then they saw Him risen and
conversing with them, then they learnt the exact faith; for great was the power of the Spirit,
which taught them all things.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Ver. 21. “He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
Me.”</p>
<p>It is not enough merely to have them, we need also an exact keeping of them. But why
doth He frequently say the same thing to them? as, “If ye love Me, ye will keep2148 My
commandments” ( ver. 15 ); and, “He that hath My commandments and keepeth them”;
and, “If any one heareth My word and keepeth it, he it is that loveth Me—he that heareth
not My words, loveth Me not.” ( Ver. 24.) I think that He alluded to their despondency; for
since He had uttered many wise sayings to them concerning death, saying, “He that hateth
his life in this world shall save it unto life eternal” ( c. xii. 25 ); and, “Unless a man take2149
his cross and follow Me, he is not worthy of Me” ( Matt. x. 38 ); and is about to say other
things besides, rebuking them, He saith, “Think ye that ye suffer sorrow from love? The not
sorrowing would be a sign of love.” And because He wished all along to establish this, as He
went on He summed up His discourse in this same point; “If ye loved Me,” He saith, “ye
would have rejoiced, because—I go to My Father” ( ver. 28 ), but now ye are in this state
through cowardice. To be thus disposed towards death is not for those who remember My
commandments; for you ought to be crucified, if you truly loved Me, for My word exhorteth
you not to be afraid of those that kill the body. Those that are such both the Father loveth
and I. “And I will manifest Myself unto him.2150 Then saith Judas,2151</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “How is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us?”2152</p>
<p>Seest thou that their soul was close pressed2153 with fear? For he was confounded and
troubled, and thought that as we see dead men in a dream, so He also would be seen. In order
therefore that they might not imagine this, hear what He saith.</p>

<p>Ver. 23. “I and the Father will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.”2154</p>
<p>All but saying, “As the Father revealeth Himself, so also do I.” And not in this way only
He rmoved the suspicion, but also by saying, “We will make Our abode with him,” a thing
which doth not belong to dreams. But observe, I pray you, the disciple confounded, and not
daring to say plainly what he desired to say. For he said not, “Woe to us, that Thou diest,
and will come to us as the dead come”; he spake not thus; but, “How is it that Thou wilt
show Thyself to us, and not unto the world?” Jesus then saith, that “I accept you, because
ye keep My commandments.” In order that they might not, when they should see Him afterwards,
2155 deem Him to be an apparition, therefore He saith these things beforehand.
And that they might not deem that He would appear to them so as I have said, He telleth
them also the reason, “Because ye keep My commandments”; He saith that the Spirit also
will appear in like manner. Now if after having companied with Him so long time, they
cannot yet endure that Essence, or rather cannot even imagine It, what would have been
their case had He appeared thus to them at the first? on this account also He ate with them,
that the action might not seem to be an illusion. For if they thought this when they saw Him
walking on the waters, although His wonted form was seen by them, and He was not far
distant, what would they have imagined had they suddenly seen Him arisen whom they had
seen taken2156 and swathed? Wherefore He continually telleth them that He will appear,
and why He will appear, and how, that they may not suppose Him to be an apparition.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings; and the word which ye hear
is not Mine, but the Father’s which sent Me.”</p>
<p>“So that he that heareth not these sayings not only doth not love Me, but neither doth
he love the Father.” For if this is the sure proof of love, the hearing the commandments,
and these are of the Father, he that heareth them loveth not the Son only, but the Father
also. “And how is the word ‘thine’ and ‘not thine’?” This means, “I speak not without the
Father, nor say anything of Myself contrary to what seemeth good to Him.”</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.”</p>
<p>Since these sayings were not clear, and since some they did not understand, and doubted
about the greater number, in order that they might not be again confused, and say, “What
commands?” He released them from all their perplexity, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “The Comforter, whom the Father shall send in My Name, He shall teach
you.”2157</p>
<note type="footnote">2154 Ver. 23. “Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father

<p>“Perhaps these things are not clear to you now, but ‘He’2158 is a clear teacher of them.”
And the, “remaineth with you” ( ver. 17 ), is the expression of One implying that Himself
will depart. Then that they may not be grieved, He saith, that as long as He should remain
with them and the Spirit should not come, they would be unable to comprehend anything
great or sublime. And this He said to prepare them to bear nobly His departure, as that
which was to be the cause of great blessings to them. He continually calleth Him “Comforter,”
because of the afflictions which then possessed them. And since even after hearing these
things they were troubled, when they thought of the sorrows, the wars, His departure, see
how He calmeth them again by saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 27. “Peace I leave to you.”2159</p>
<p>All but saying, “What are ye harmed by the trouble of the world, provided ye be at peace
with2160 Me? For this peace is not of the same kind as that. The one is external, is often
mischievous and unprofitable, and is no advantage to those who possess it; but I give you
peace of such a kind that ye be at peace with one another, which thing rendereth you
stronger.” And because He said again, “I leave,” which was the expression of One departing,
and enough to confound them, therefore He again saith,</p>
<p>“Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that they were affected partly by loving affection, partly by fear?
Ver. 28. “Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye
loved Me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father; for My Father is greater than
I.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> And what joy would this bring to them? What consolation? What then mean the
words? They did not yet know concerning the Resurrection, nor had they right opinion
concerning Him; (for how could they, who did not even know that He would rise again?)
but they thought that the Father was mighty. He saith then, that “If ye are fearful for Me, as
not able to defend Myself, and if ye are not confident that I shall see you again after the
Crucifixion, yet when ye heard that I go to the Father, ye ought then to have rejoiced because
I go away to One that is greater, and able to undo all dangers.” “Ye have heard how I said
unto you.” Why hath He put this? Because, He saith, “I am so firmly confident about the
things which come to pass, that I even foretell them, so far am I from fearing.” This also is
the meaning of what follows.</p>

<p>Ver. 29. “And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass,
ye might believe that I Am.”2161 As though He had said, “Ye would not have known, had I
not told you. And I should not have told you, had I not been confident.” Seest thou that the
speech is one of condescension? for when He saith, “Think ye that I cannot pray to the
Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of Angels” ( Matt. xxvi. 53
), He speaketh to the secret thoughts of the hearers; since no one, even in the height of
madness, would say that He was not able to help Himself, but needed Angels; but because
they thought of Him as a man, therefore He spoke of “twelve legions of Angels.” Yet in truth
He did but ask those who came to take Him a question, and cast them backwards. ( c. xviii.
6.) (If any one say that the Father is greater, inasmuch as2162 He is the cause of the Son, we
will not contradict this. But this doth not by any means make the Son to be of a different
Essence.) But what He saith, is of this kind: “As long as I am here, it is natural that you
should deem that I am2163 in danger; but when I am gone ‘there,’2164 be confident that I
am in safety; for Him none will be able to overcome.” All these words were addressed to the
weakness of the disciples, for, “I Myself am confident, and care not for death.” On this account,
He said, “I have told you these things before they come to pass”; “but since,” He saith,
“ye are not yet able to receive the saying concerning them, I bring you comfort even from
the Father, whom ye entitle great.” Having thus consoled them, He again telleth them sorrowful
things,</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “Hereafter I will not talk2165 with you.” Wherefore? “For the ruler of this world
cometh, and hath nothing in Me.”</p>
<p>By “ruler of this world,” He meaneth the devil, calling wicked men also by the same
name. For he ruleth not heaven and earth, since he would have been subverted, and cast
down all things, but he ruleth over those who give themselves up to him. Wherefore He
calleth him, “the ruler of the darkness of this world,” in this place again calling evil deeds,
“darkness.” “What then, doth the devil slay Thee?” By no means; “he hath nothing in Me.”
“How then do they kill Thee?” Because I will it, and,</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “‘That the world may know that I love the Father.’”2166</p>
<p>“For being not subject,” He saith, “to death, nor a debtor to it, I endure it through My
love to the Father.” This He saith, that He may again rouse their souls, and that they may
learn that not unwillingly but willingly He goeth to this thing, and that He doth it despising

the devil. It was not enough for Him to have said, “Yet a little while I am with you” ( c. vii.
33 ), but He continually handleth this painful subject, (with good reason,) until He should
make it acceptable to them, by weaving along with it pleasant things. Wherefore at one time
He saith, “I go, and I come again”; and, “That where I there ye may be also”; and, “Ye cannot
follow Me now, but afterwards ye shall follow Me”; and, “I go to the Father”; and, “The
Father is greater than I”; and, “Before it come to pass, I have told you”; and, “I do not suffer
these things from constraint, but from love for the Father.” So that they might consider,
that the action could not be destructive nor hurtful, if at least He who greatly loved Him,
and was greatly loved by Him, so willed. On this account, while intermingling these pleasant
words, He continually uttered the painful ones also, practicing their minds. For both the,
“remaineth with you” ( c. xvi. 7 ), and, “My departure is expedient for you,” were expressions
of One giving comfort. For this reason He spake by anticipation ten thousand sayings concerning
the Spirit,2167 the, “Is in you,” and, “The world cannot receive,” and, “He shall bring
all things to your remembrance,” and, “Spirit of truth,” and, “Holy Spirit,” and, “Comforter,”
and that “It is expedient for you,” in order that they might not despond, as though there
would be none to stand before and help them. “It is expedient,” He saith, showing that It2168
would make them spiritual.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> This at least, we see, was what took place. For they who now trembled and feared,
after they had received the Spirit sprang into the midst of dangers, and stripped themselves
for the contest against steel, and fire, and wild beasts, and seas, and every kind of punishment;
and they, the unlettered and ignorant, discoursed so boldly as to astonish their hearers. For
the Spirit made them men of iron instead of men of clay, gave them wings, and allowed
them to be cast down by nothing human. For such is that grace; if it find despondency, it
disperses it; if evil desires, it consumes them; if cowardice, it casts it out, and doth not allow
one who has partaken of it to be afterwards mere man, but as it were removing him to
heaven itself, causes him to image to himself all that is there. ( Acts iv. 32, and ii. 46.) On
this account no one said that any of the things that he possessed was his own, but they
continued in prayer, in praise, and in singleness of heart. For this the Holy Spirit most re-
quireth, for “the fruit of the Spirit is joy, peace—faith, meek ness.” ( Gal. v. 22, 23.) “And
yet spiritual persons often grieve,” saith some one. But that sorrow is sweeter than joy. Cain
was sorrowful, but with the sorrow of the world; Paul was sorrowful, but with godly sorrow.
Everything that is spiritual brings the greatest gain, just as everything that is worldly the
utmost loss. Let us then draw to us the invincible aid of the Spirit, by keeping the commandments,
and then we shall be nothing inferior to the Angels. For neither are they therefore
of this character,2169 because they are incorporeal, for were this the case, no incorporeal
<note type="footnote">2167 al. “concerning It.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2168 i.e. the Holy Spirit.</note>
<note type="footnote">2169 i.e. keeping God’s commands.</note>

being would have become wicked, but the will is in every case the cause of all. Wherefore
among incorporeal beings some have been found worse than men or things irrational, and
among those having bodies some better than the incorporeal. All just men, for instance,
whatever were their righteous deeds, did them while dwelling on earth, and having bodies.
For they dwelt on earth as those who were pilgrims and strangers; but in heaven, as citizens.
Then say not thou either, “I am clothed with flesh, I cannot get the mastery, nor undertake
the toils2170 which are for the sake of virtue.” Do not accuse the Creator. For if the wearing
the flesh make virtue impossible, then the fault is not ours. But that it does not make it impossible,
the band of saints has shown. A nature of flesh did not prevent Paul from becoming
what he was, nor Peter from receiving the keys of heaven; and Enoch also, having worn
flesh, was translated, and not found. So also Elias was caught up with the flesh. Abraham
also with Isaac and his grandson shone brightly, having the flesh; and Joseph in the flesh
struggled against that abandoned woman. But why speak I of the flesh? For though thou
place a chain upon the flesh, no harm is done. “Though I am bound,” saith Paul, yet “the
word of God is not bound.” ( 2 Tim. ii. 9.) And why speak I of bonds and chains? Add to
these the prison,2171 and bars, yet neither are these any hindrance to virtue; at least so Paul
hath instructed us. For the bond of the soul is not iron but cowardice, and the desire of
wealth, and the ten thousand passions. These bind us, though our body be free. “But,” saith
some one, “these have their origin from the body.” An excuse this, and a false pretense. For
had they been produced from the body, all would have undergone them. For as we cannot
escape weariness, and sleep, and hunger, and thirst, since they belong to our nature; so too
these, if they were of the same kind, would not allow any one to be exempt from their tyranny;
but since many escape them, it is clear that such things are the faults of a careless soul. Let
us then put a stop to this, and not accuse the body, but subdue it to the soul, that having it
under command, we may enjoy the everlasting good things, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xiv. 31; xv. 1</p>
<p>“Arise, let us go hence. I am the true Vine, (ye are the branches,2172 ) and My Father is the
Husbandman.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> ‘ Ignorance’ makes the soul timid and unmanly, just as instruction in heavenly
doctrines makes it great and sublime. For when it has enjoyed no care, it is in a manner
timid, not by nature but by will.2173 For when I see the man who once was brave,2174 now
become a coward, I say that this latter feeling no longer belongs to nature, for what is natural
is immutable. Again, when I see those who but now were cowards all at once become daring,
I pass the same judgment, and refer all to will. Since even the disciples were very fearful,
before they had learned what they ought, and had been deemed worthy of the gift of the
Spirit; yet afterwards they became bolder than lions. So Peter, who could not bear the threat
of a damsel, was hung with his head downwards, and was scourged, and though he endured
ten thousand dangers, would not be silent, but enduring what he endured as though it were
a dream, in such a situation spake boldly; but not so before the Crucifixion. Wherefore
Christ said, “Arise, let us go hence.” “But why, tell me? Did he not know the hour at which
Judas would come upon Him? Or perhaps He feared lest he should come and seize them,
and lest the plotters should be upon him before he had furnished his most excellent teaching.”
Away with the thought! these things are far from His dignity. “If then He did not fear, why
did He remove them, and then after finish ing His discourse lead them into a garden known
to Judas? And even had Judas come, could He not have blinded their eyes, as He also did
when the traitor was not present?2175 Why did He remove them?” He alloweth the disciples
a little breathing time. For it was likely that they, as being in a conspicuous place, would
tremble and fear, both on the account of the time and the place, (for it was the depth of
night,) and would not give2176 heed to His words, but would be continually turning about,
and imagining that they heard those who were to set upon them; and that more especially
when their Master’s speech made them expect evil. For, “yet a little while,” He saith, “and I
am not with you,” and, “the ruler of this world cometh.” Since now when they heard these
and the like words they were troubled, as though they should certainly be taken immediately,
He leadeth them to another place, in order that thinking themselves in safety, they might

listen to Him without fear. For they were about to hear lofty doctrines. Therefore He saith,
“Arise, let us go hence.” Then He addeth, and saith,2177 “I am the Vine, ye are the branches.”
What willeth He to imply by the comparison? That the man who gives no heed to His words
can have no life, and that the miracles about to take place, would be wrought by the power
of Christ. “My Father is the Husbandman.” “How then? Doth the Son need a power2178
working within?” Away with the thought! this example does not signify this. Observe with
what exactness He goeth through the comparison. He saith not that the “root” enjoys the
care of the Husbandman, but, “the branches.” And the foot is brought in in this place for
no other purpose, but that they may learn that they can work nothing without His power,
and that they ought to be united with Him by faith as the branch with the vine.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit the Father2179 taketh away.”</p>
<p>Here He alludeth to the manner of life, showing that without works it is not possible to
be in Him.</p>
<p>“And every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it.”2180</p>
<p>That is, “causeth it to enjoy great care.” Yet the root requires care rather than the
branches, in being dug about, and cleared, yet about this He saith nothing here, but all about
the branches. Showing that He is sufficient to Himself, and that the disciples need much
help from the Husbandman, although they be very excellent. Wherefore He saith, “that
which beareth fruit, He purgeth it.” The one branch, because it is fruitless, cannot even remain
in the Vine, but for the other, because it beareth fruit, He rendereth it more fruitful. This,
some one might assert, was said with relation also to the persecutions then coming upon
them. For the “purgeth it,” is “pruneth,” which makes the branch bear better. Whence it is
shown, that persecutions rather make men stronger. Then, lest they should ask concerning
whom He said these things, and lest He should throw them back into anxiety, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He introduceth Himself as tending the branches? “I have cleansed you,”
He saith; yet above He declareth that the Father doth this. But there is no separation2181
between the Father and the Son. “And now your part also must be performed.” Then to
show that He did not this as needing their ministry,2182 but for their advancement, He addeth,</p>
<note type="footnote">2177 al. “having led them away, He saith.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2178 ἐ νεργείας</note>
<note type="footnote">2179 “He,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="547"/>
<p>Ver. 4.2183 “As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, so neither
can he who abideth not in Me.”2184</p>
<p>For that they might not be separated from Him by timidity, He fasteneth and glueth to
Himself their souls slackened through fear, and holdeth out to them good hopes for the future.
For the root remains, but to be taken away, or to be left, belongs to the branches. Then
having urged them on in both ways, by things pleasant and things painful, He requireth
first what is to be done on our side.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “He that abideth in Me, and I in him.”2185</p>
<p>Seest thou that the Son contributeth not less than the Father towards the care of the
disciples? The Father purgeth, but He keepeth them in Himself. The abiding in the root is
that which maketh the branches to be fruit-bearing. For that which is not purged, if it remain
on the root, bears fruit, though perhaps not so much as it ought; but that which remains
not, bears none at all. But still the “purging” also hath been shown to belong to the Son, and
the “abiding in the root,” to the Father, who also begat the Root. Seest thou how all is common,
2186 both the “purging,” and the enjoying the virtue which is from the root?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Now it were a great penalty, the being able to do nothing, but He stayeth not the
punishment at this point, but carrieth on His discourse farther.</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “He is cast forth,”2187 He saith.</p>
<p>No longer enjoying the benefit of the husbandman’s hand. “And is withered.” That is,
if he had aught of the root, he loses it; if any grace, he is stripped of this, and is bereft of the
help and life which proceed from it. And what the end? “He is cast into the fire.” Not such
he who abideth with Him. Then He showeth what it is to “abide,” and saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “If My words abide in you.”2188</p>
<p>Seest thou that with reason I said above, that He seeketh the proof by works? For when
He had said, “Whatsoever ye shall ask I will do it” ( c. xiv. 14, 15 ), He added, “If ye love Me,
ye will keep2189 My commandments.” And here, “If ye abide in Me, and My words abide
in you.”</p>
<p>“Ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.”</p>

<pb n="548"/>
<p>This He said to show that they who plotted against Him should be burnt up, but that
“they” should bear fruit. Then transferring the fear from them to the others, and showing
that they should be invincible, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “Herein is My Father glorified, that ye be My disciples, and bear much fruit.”
Hence He maketh His discourse credible, for if the bearing fruit pertains to the glory
of the Father, He will not neglect His own glory. “And ye shall be My disciples.” Seest thou
how he that beareth fruit, he is the disciple? But what is, “In this is the Father glorified”?
“He rejoiceth when ye abide in Me, when ye bear fruit.”</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you.”</p>
<p>Here at length He speaketh in a more human manner, for this, as spoken to men,2190
has its peculiar force. Since what a measure of love did He manifest, who chose to die, who
counted worthy of such honor those who were His slaves, His haters, His open enemies,
and led them up to the heavens! “If then I love you, be bold; if it be the glory of My Father
that ye bear fruit, imagine nothing ill.” Then that He may not make them supine, observe
how He braceth them again,</p>
<p>“Continue ye in My love.”</p>
<p>“For this ye have the power to do.” And how shall this be?</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “If ye keep My commandments, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments.”
2191</p>
<p>Again, His discourse proceedeth in a human way; for certainly the Lawgiver would not
be subject to commandments. Seest thou that here also, as I am always saying, this is declared
because of the infirmity of the hearers? For He chiefly speaketh to their suspicions, and by
every means showeth them that they are in safety, and that their enemies are being lost, and
that all, whatever they have, they have from the Son, and that, if they show forth a pure life,
none shall ever have the mastery over them. And observe that He discourseth with them in
a very authoritative manner, for He said not, “abide in the love of My Father,” but, “in Mine”;
then, lest they should say, “when Thou hast set us at war with all men, Thou leavest us, and
departest,” He showeth that He doth not leave them, but is so joined to them if they will, as
the branch in the vine. Then, lest from confidence they should become supine, He saith not
that the blessing cannot be removed if they are slack-minded. And in order not to refer the
action to Himself, and so make them more apt to fall, He saith, “Herein is My Father glorified.”
For everywhere He manifesteth His own and His Father’s love towards them. Not the
things of the Jews, then, were “glory,” but those which they2192 were about to receive. And
that they might not say, “we have been driven from the possessions of our fathers, we have
<note type="footnote">2190 al. “suitably to a man.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2191 Ver. 10. “If ye keep,” U+0026c., “ye shall abide in My love; even as,” U+0026c., “and abide in His love.” N.T.</note>

been deserted, we have become naked, and destitute of all things,” “Look,” He saith, “on
Me. I am loved by the Father, yet still I suffer these things appointed. And so I am not now
leaving you because I love you not. For if I am slain, and take not this for a proof of not being
loved by the Father, neither ought ye to be troubled. For, if ye continue in My love, these
dangers shall not be able to do you any mischief on the score of love.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Since then love is a thing mighty and irresistible, not a bare word, let us manifest it
by our actions. He reconciled us when we were His enemies, let us, now that we have become
His friends, remain so. He led the way, let us at least follow; He loveth us not for His own
advantage, (for He needeth nothing,) let us at least love Him for our profit; He loved us
being His enemies, let us at least love Him being our friend. At present we do the contrary;
for every day God is blasphemed through us, through our plunderings, through our covetousness.
And perhaps one of you will say, “Every day thy discourse is about covetousness.”
Would that I could speak about it every night too; would that I could do so, following you
about in the market-place, and at your table; would that both wives, and friends, and children,
and domestics, and tillers of the soil, and neighbors, and the very pavement and walls, could
ever shout forth this word, that so we might perchance have relaxed a little. For this malady
hath seized upon all the world, and occupies the souls of all, and great is the tyranny of
Mammon. We have been ransomed by Christ, and are the slaves of gold. We proclaim the
sovereignty of the one, and obey the other. Whatever “he” commands we readily obey, and
we have refused to know family, or friendship, or nature, or laws, or anything, for him. No
one looks up to Heaven, no one thinks about things to come. But there will be a time, when
there will be no profit even in2193 these words. “In the grave,” it saith, “who shall confess
to Thee?” Gold is a desirable thing, and procures us much luxury, and makes us to be
honored, but not in like manner as doth Heaven. For from the wealthy man many even turn
aside, and hate him, but him who lives virtuously they respect and honor. “But” saith some
one “the poor man is derided, even though he be virtuous.” Not among men, but brutes.2194
Wherefore he ought not so much as to notice them. For if asses were to bray and daws
chatter at us, while all wise men commended us, we should not, losing sight of this latter
audience, have regard to clamors of the brutes; for like to daws, and worse than asses, are
they who admire present things. Moreover, if an earthly king approve thee, thou makest no
account of the many, though they all deride thee; but if the Lord of the universe praise thee,
seekest thou the good words of beetles and gnats? For this is what these men are, compared
with God, or rather not even this, but something viler, if there be aught such. How long do
we wallow in the mire? How long do we set sluggards and belly-gods for our judges? They
can prove dicers well, drunkards, those who live for the belly, but as for virtue and vice, they
<note type="footnote">2193 al. “no time for.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2194 ἀ λόγοις</note>

<pb n="550"/>
cannot imagine so much as a dream. If any one taunt thee because thou hast not skill to
draw the channels of the watercourses, 2195 thou wilt not think it any terrible thing, but wilt
even laugh at him who objects to thee ignorance of this kind; and dost thou, when thou
desirest to practice virtue, appoint as judges those who know nothing of it? On this account
we never reach that art. We commit our case not to the practiced, but to the unlearned, and
they judge not according to the rules of art, but according to their own ignorance. Wherefore,
I exhort you, let us despise the many; or rather let us desire neither praises, nor possessions,
nor wealth, nor deem poverty any evil. For poverty is to us a teacher of prudence, and endurance,
and all true wisdom. Thus Lazarus lived in poverty, and received a crown; Jacob
desired to get bread only; and Joseph was in the extreme of poverty, being not merely a
slave, but also a prisoner; and on this account we admire him the more, and we do not so
much praise him when he distributed the corn, as when he dwelt in the dungeon: not when
he wore the diadem, but when the chain; not when he sat upon the throne, but when he was
plotted against and sold.2196 Considering then all these things, and the crowns twined for
us after the conflicts, let us admire not wealth, and honor, and luxury, and power, but
poverty, and the chain, and bonds, and endurance in the cause of virtue. For the end of
those things is full of troubles and confusion, and their lot is bound up with this present
life; but the fruit of these, heaven, and the good things in the heavens, which neither eye
hath seen, nor ear heard; which may we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xv. 11, 12</p>
<p>“These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy
might be full. This is My commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> All things good then have their reward, when they arrive at their proper end, but if
they be cut off midway, shipwreck ensues. And as a vessel of immense burden, if it reach
not the harbor in time, but founder in the midst of the sea, gains nothing from the length
of the voyage, but even makes the calamity greater, in proportion as it has endured more
toils; so are those souls which fall back when near the end of their labors, and faint in the
midst of the struggle. Wherefore Paul said, that glory, and honor, and peace, should meet
those who ran their course with patient continuance in well-doing. A thing which Christ
now effecteth in the case of the disciples. ( Rom. ii. 7.) For since He had accepted them, and
they rejoiced in Him, and then the sudden coming of the Passion and His sad words were
likely to cut short their pleasure; after having conversed with them sufficiently to soothe
them, He addeth, “These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you,
and that your joy might be fulfilled”; that is, “that ye might not be separated from Me, that
ye might not cut short your course. Ye were rejoicing in Me, and ye were rejoicing exceedingly,
but despondency hath fallen upon you. This then I remove, that joy may come at the
last, showing that your present circumstances are fit cause, not for pain, but for pleasure. I
saw you offended; I despised you not; I said not, ‘Why do ye not continue noble?’ But I
spake to you words which brought comfort with them. And so I wish ever to keep you in
the same love. Ye have heard concerning a kingdom, ye rejoiced. In order therefore that
your joy might be fulfilled, I have spoken these things unto you.” But “this is the commandment,
that ye love one another as I have loved you.” Seest thou that the love of God is intertwined
with our own, and connected like a sort of chain? Wherefore it sometimes saith that
there are two commandments, sometimes only one. For it is not possible that the man who
hath taken hold on the first should not possess the second also. For at one time He said,
“On this the Law and the Prophets hang”2197 ( Matt. xxii. 40 ); and at another, “Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the Law and the
Prophets.” ( Matt. vii. 12.) And, “Love is the fulfilling of the Law.” ( Rom. xiii. 10.) Which
He saith also here; for if to abide proceeds from love, and love from the keeping of the
commandments, and the commandment is that we love one another, then the abiding in
God proceeds from love towards each other. And He doth not simply speak of love, but
declareth also the manner, “As I have loved you.” Again He showeth, that His very departure
<note type="footnote">2197 “On these two commandments,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="552"/>
was not of hatred but of love. “So that I ought rather to be admired on this account, for I
lay down My life for you.”2198 Yet nowhere doth He say this in these words, but in a former
place, by sketching the best shepherd, and here by exhorting them, and by showing the
greatness of His love, and Himself, who He is. But wherefore doth He everywhere exalt love?
Because this is the mark of the disciples, this the bond of virtue.2199 On this account Paul
saith such great things of it, as being a genuine disciple of Christ, and having had experience
of it.</p>
<p>Ver. 14, 15. “Ye are My friends2200 —henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant
knoweth not what his lord doeth. Ye are My friends, for2201 all things which I have heard
of My Father I have made known unto you.”</p>
<p>How then saith He, “I have many things to tell you, but ye cannot bear them now”? ( c.
xvi. 12.) By the “all” and the “hearing” He showeth nothing else, but that He uttered nothing
alien, but only what was of the Father. And since to speak of secrets appears to be the
strongest proof of friendship, “ye have,” He saith, “been deemed worthy even of this communion.”
When however He saith “all,” He meaneth, “whatever things it was fit that they
should hear.” Then He putteth also another sure proof of friendship, no common one. Of
what sort was that?</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you.”</p>
<p>That is, I ran upon your friendship. And He stayed not here, but,</p>
<p>“I set you,”2202 He saith, (that is, “I planted you,”) “that ye should go,” (He still useth
the metaphor of the vine,) that is, “that ye should extend yourselves”; “and bring forth fruit,
and that your fruit should remain.”</p>
<p>“Now if your fruit remain, much more shall ye. For I have not only loved you,” He saith,
“but have done you the greatest benefits, by extending your branches through all the world.”
Seest thou in how many ways He showeth His love? By telling them things secret, by having
in the first instance run to meet their friendship, by granting them the greatest blessings,
by suffering for them what then He suffered. After this, He showeth that He also remaineth
continually with those who shall bring forth fruit; for it is needful to enjoy His aid, and so
to bear fruit.</p>
<p>“That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may give it you.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2198 Ver. 13. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” N.T.</note>

<p>Yet it is the part of the person asked to do the thing asked; but if the Father is asked,
how is it that the Son doeth it? It is that thou mayest learn that the Son is not inferior to the
Father.</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “These things I command you, that ye love one another.”</p>
<p>That is, “It is not to upbraid, that I tell you that I lay down My life for you, or that I ran
to meet you, but in order to lead you into friendship.” Then, since the being persecuted and
insulted by the many, was a grievous and intolerable thing, and enough to humble even a
lofty soul, therefore, after having said ten thousand things first, Christ entered upon this
matter.2203 Having first smoothed their minds, He thus proceedeth to these points, showing
that these things too were for their exceeding advantage, as He had also shown that the
others were. For as He had told them that they ought not to grieve, but rather to rejoice,
“because I go to the Father,” (since He did this not as deserting but as greatly loving them,)
so here also He showeth that they ought to rejoice, not grieve. And observe how He effecteth
this. He said not, “I know that the action is grievous, but bear for My sake, since for My sake
also ye suffer,” for this reason was not yet sufficient to console them; wherefore letting this
pass, He putteth forward another. And what is that? It is that this thing2204 would be a sure
proof of their former virtue. “And, on the contrary, ye ought to grieve, not because ye are
hated now but if ye were likely to be loved”; for this He implieth by saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “If ye were of the world, the world would love its own.”2205</p>
<p>So that had ye been loved it would be very clear that ye had shown forth signs of
wickedness. Then, when by saying this first, He did not effect his purpose, He goeth on
again with the discourse.</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will
also persecute you.”2206</p>
<p>He showed that in this point they would be most His imitators. For while Christ was in
the flesh, men had war with Him, but when He was translated, the battle came in the next
place upon them. Then because owing to their fewness they were terrified at being about to
encounter the attack of so great a multitude, He raiseth their souls by telling them that it
was an especial subject of joy that they were hated by them; “For so ye shall share My sufferings.
Ye should not therefore be troubled, for ye are not better than I,” as I before told you,

“The servant is not greater than his lord.” Then there is also a third source of consolation,
that the Father also is insulted together with them.</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “But all these things will they do unto you for My Name’s sake, because they
know not Him that sent Me.”</p>
<p>That is, “they insult Him also.” Besides this, depriving those others of excuse, and putting
also another source of comfort, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.”2207</p>
<p>Showing that they shall do unjustly both what they do against Him and against them.
“Why then didst Thou2208 bring us into such calamities? Didst Thou not foreknow the wars,
the hatred?” Therefore again He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “He that hateth Me, hateth My Father also.”</p>
<p>From this also proclaiming beforehand no small punishment against them. For, since
they continually pretended that they persecuted Him on account of the Father, to deprive
them of this excuse He spake these words. “They have no excuse. I gave them the teaching
which is by words, that by works I added, according to the Law of Moses, who bade all men
obey one speaking and doing such things, when he should both lead to piety, and exhibit
the greatest miracles.”2209 And He spake not simply of “signs,” but,</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Which none other man did.”2210</p>
<p>And of this they themselves are witnesses, speaking in this way; “It was never so seen
in Israel” ( Matt. ix. 33 ); and, “Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened
the eyes of one that was born blind” ( c. ix. 32 ); and the matter of Lazarus was of the same
kind, and all the other acts the same, and the mode of wonder-working new, and all beyond2211
thought. “Why then,” saith one, “do they persecute both Thee and us?” “Because
ye are not of the world. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own.” ( Ver. 19.)
He first remindeth them of the words which He spake also to His own brethren ( c. vii. 7 );
but there he spake more by way of a reflection,2212 lest He should offend them, while here,
on the contrary, He revealed all. “And how is it clear that it is on this account that we are
hated?” “From what was done to Me. For, tell Me, which of My words or deeds could they
lay hold on, that they would not receive Me?” Then since the thing would be astounding to

us, He telleth the cause; that is, their wickedness. And He stayeth not here either, but introduceth
the Prophet ( Ps. xxxv. 19; lxix. 4 ), showing him proclaiming before of old time, and
saying, that,</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “They hated Me without a cause.”2213</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Which Paul doth also. For when many wondered how that the Jews believed not,
he brings in Prophets foretelling it of old, and declaring the cause; that their wickedness
and pride were the cause of their unbelief. “Well then; if they kept not Thy saying, neither
will they keep ours; if they persecuted Thee, therefore they will persecute us also; if they saw
signs, such as none other man wrought; if they heard words such as none other spake, and
profited nothing; if they hate Thy Father and Thee with Him, wherefore,” saith one, “hast
Thou sent us in among them? How after this shall we be worthy of belief? which of our
kindred will give-heed to us?” That they may not therefore be troubled by such thoughts,
see what sort of comfort he addeth.</p>
<p>Ver. 26, 27. “When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me. And ye
also shall bear witness, because ye have been with Me from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“He shall be worthy of belief, for He is the Spirit of Truth.” On this account He called
It not “Holy Spirit,” but “Spirit of Truth.” But the, “proceedeth from the Father,” showeth
that He2214 knoweth all things exactly, as Christ also saith of Himself, that “I know whence
come and whither I go” ( c. viii. 14 ), speaking in that place also concerning truth. “Whom
will send.” Behold, it is no longer the Father alone, but the Son also who sendeth. “And ye
too,” He saith, “have a right to be believed, who have been with Me, who have not heard
from others.” Indeed, the Apostles confidently rely on this circumstance, saying, “We who
did eat and drink with Him.” ( Acts x. 41.) And to show that this was not merely said to
please, the Spirit beareth witness to the words spoken. ( Acts x. 44.)</p>
<p>Ch. xvi. ver. 1. “These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.”</p>
<p>That is, “when ye see many disbelieve, and yourselves ill-treated.”</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “They shall put you out of the synagogues.”</p>
<p>(For “the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should confess Christ, he should be
put out of the synagogues”— c. ix. 22.)</p>
<p>“Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”</p>
<p>“They shall so seek after2215 your murder, as of an action pious and pleasing to God.”
Then again He addeth the consolation,</p>
<note type="footnote">2213 Ver. 25. “But that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They,” U+0026c, N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2214 i.e. the Holy Ghost.</note>
<note type="footnote">2215 al. “think of.”</note>

<pb n="556"/>
<p>Ver. 3. “And these things will they do,2216 because they have not known the Father, nor
Me.”</p>
<p>“It is sufficient for your comfort that ye endure these things for My sake, and the Father’s.”
Here He remindeth them of the blessedness of which He spake at the beginning,
“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward
in heaven.” ( Matt. v. 11, 12.)</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “These things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember
them.”2217</p>
<p>“So, judging from these words, deem the rest also trustworthy. For ye will not be able
to say, that I flatteringly told you only those things which would please you, nor that the
words were words of deceit; for one who intended to deceive, would not have told you beforehand
of matters likely to turn you away. I have therefore told you before, that these
things might not fall upon you unexpectedly, and trouble you; and for another reason besides,
that ye might not say, that I did not foreknow that these things would be. Remember then
that I have told you.” And indeed the heathen always covered their persecutions of them
by a pretense of their wickedness, driving them out as corrupters; but this did not trouble
the disciples who had heard beforehand, and knew for what they suffered. The cause of what
took place was sufficient to rouse their courage. Therefore He everywhere handleth this,
saying, “they have not known Me”; and, “for My sake they shall do it”; and, “for My Name’s
sake, and for the Father’s sake”; and, “I suffered first”; and, “from no just cause they dare
these things.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us too consider these things in our temptations, when we suffer anything from
wicked men, “looking to the Beginner2218 and Finisher of our faith” ( Heb. xii. 2 ), and
considering that it is by wicked men, and that it is for virtue’s sake, and for His sake. For if
we reflect on these things, all will be most easy and tolerable. Since if one suffering for those
he loves is even proud of it, what feeling of things dreadful will he have who suffers for the
sake of God? For if He, for our sake, calleth that shameful thing, the Cross, “glory” ( c. xiii.
31 ), much more ought we to be thus disposed. And if we can so despise sufferings, much
more shall we be able to despise riches, and covetousness. We ought then, when about to
endure anything unpleasant, to think not of the toils but of the crowns; for as merchants
take into account not the seas only, but also the profits, so ought we to reckon on heaven
and confidence towards God. And if the getting more seem a pleasant thing, think that
Christ willeth it not, and straightway it will appear displeasing. And if it be grievous to you
<note type="footnote">2216 “do unto you,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2217 “may remember that I told you of them,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2218 ἀ ρχηγὸν, so rendered in margin of E.V.</note>

<pb n="557"/>
to give to the poor, stay not your reckoning at the expense, but straightway transport your
thoughts to the harvest which results from the sowing; and when it is hard to despise the
love of a strange woman, think of the crown which comes after the struggle, and thou shalt
easily bear the struggle. For if fear diverts a man from unseemly things, much more should
the love of Christ. Difficult is virtue; but let us cast around her form the greatness of the
promise of things to come. Indeed those who are virtuous, even apart from these promises,
see her beautiful in herself, and on this account go after her, and work because it seems good
to God, not for hire; and they think it a great thing to be sober-minded, not in order that
they may not be punished, but because God hath commanded it. But if any one is too weak
for this, let him think of the prizes. So let us do in respect of alms-doing, let us pity our fellowmen,
let us not, I entreat,2219 neglect them when perishing with hunger. How can it be
otherwise than an unseemly thing, that we should sit at the table laughing and enjoying
ourselves, and when we hear others wailing as they pass through the street, should not even
turn at their cries, but be wroth with them, and call them “cheat”? “What meanest thou,
man? Doth any one plan a cheat for a single loaf of bread?” “Yes,” saith some one. Then in
this case above all let him be pitied; in this case above all let him be delivered from his need.
Or if thou art not minded to give, do not insult either; if thou wilt not save the wreck, do
not thrust it into the gulf. For consider, when thou thrustest away the poor man who comes
to thee, who thou wilt be when thou callest upon God. “With what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you again.” ( Matt. vii. 2.) Consider how he departs, crushed, bowed down,
lamenting; besides his poverty having received also the blow from your insolence. For if ye
count the begging a curse, think what a tempest it makes, begging to get nothing, but to go
away insulted. How long shall we be like wild beasts, and know not nature itself through
greediness? Many groan at these words; but I desire them not now, but always, to have this
feeling of compassion. Think, I pray you, of that day when we shall stand before the judgment-
seat of Christ, when we shall beg for mercy, and Christ, bringing them forward, shall
say, “For the sake of a single loaf, of a single obol, so great a surge did ye raise in these souls!”
What shall we reply? What defense shall we make? To show that He will bring them forward,
hear what He saith; “Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these, ye did it not to Me.” ( Matt.
xxv. 45.) They will no more say anything to us, but God on their behalf will upbraid us.
Since the rich man saw Lazarus too, 2220 and Lazarus said nothing to him, but Abraham
spake for him; and thus it will be in the case of the poor who are now despised by us. We
shall not see them stretching out their hands in pitiful state, but being in rest; and we shall
take the state which was theirs (and would that it were that state only, and not one much
more grievous) as a punishment. For neither did the rich man desire to be filled with crumbs
<note type="footnote">2219 al. “nor let us.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2220 i.e. as well as Abraham.</note>

<pb n="558"/>
“there,” but was scorched and tormented sharply, and was told, “Thou in thy lifetime receivedst
thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things.” ( Luke xvi. 25.) Let us not then
deem wealth any great thing; it will help us on our way to punishment, if we take not heed,
just as, if we take heed, poverty also becomes to us an addition of enjoyment and rest. For
we both put off our sins if we bear it with thankfulness, and gain great boldness before God.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Let us then not be ever seeking security here, in order that we may enjoy security
there; but let us accept the labors which are in behalf of virtue, and cut off superfluities, and
seek nothing more than we need, and spend all our substance on those who want. Since
what excuse can we have, when God promiseth heaven to us, and we will not even give Him
bread? when He indeed for thee maketh the sun to rise, and supplieth all the ministry of the
Creation, but thou dost not even give Him a garment, nor allow Him to share thy roof? But
why speak I of sun and moon? He hath set His Body before thee, He hath given thee His
Precious Blood; and dost thou not even impart to Him of thy cup? But hast thou done so
for once? This is not mercy; as long as, having the means, thou helpest not, thou hast not
yet fulfilled the whole duty. Thus the virgins who had the lamps, had oil, but not in abundance.
Why, thou oughtest, even didst thou give from thine own, not to be so miserly, but
now when thou givest what is thy Lord’s, why countest thou every little? Will ye that I tell
you the cause of this inhumanity? When men get together their wealth through greediness,
these same are slow to give alms; for one who has learnt so to gain, knows not how to spend.
For how can a man prepared for rapine adapt himself to its contrary? He who takes from
others, how shall he be able to give up his own to another? A dog accustomed to feed on
flesh cannot guard the flock; therefore the shepherds kill such. That this be not our fate, let
us refrain from such feasting. For these men too feed on flesh, when they bring on death by
hunger. Seest thou not how God hath allowed to us all things in common? If amid riches
He hath suffered men to be poor, it is for the consolation of the rich, that they may be able
by showing mercy towards them to put off their sins. But thou even in this hast been cruel
and inhuman; whence it is evident, that if thou hadst received this same power in greater
things, thou wouldest have committed ten thousand murders, and wouldest have debarred
men from light, and from life altogether.2221 That this might not take place, necessity hath
cut short insatiableness in such matters.</p>
<p>If ye are pained when ye hear these things, much more I when I see them taking place.
How long shalt thou be rich, and that man poor? Till evening, but no farther; for so short
is life, and all things so near their end,2222 and all things henceforth so stand at the door,
that the whole must be deemed but a little hour. What need hast thou of bursting2223
<note type="footnote">2221 lit. “all life.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2222 Ben. omits “all things so near their end.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2223 ἐ ρευγομένων</note>

<pb n="559"/>
storehouses, of a multitude of domestics and house-keepers? Why hast thou not ten thousand
proclaimers of thy almsdoing? The storehouse utters no voice, yet will it bring upon thee
many robbers; but the storehouses of the poor will go up to God Himself, and will make thy
present life sweet, and put away all thy sins, and thou shalt gain glory from God, and honor
from men. Why then grudgest thou thyself such good things? For thou wilt not do so much
good to the poor, as to thyself, when thou benefitest them. Thou wilt right their present
state; but for thyself thou wilt lay up beforehand the glory and confidence which shall be
hereafter. And this may we all obtain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be the glory and the might for ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>Homily LXXVIII.</p>
<p>John xvi. 4–6</p>
<p>“These things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go My
way to Him that sent Me; and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? But because
I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great is the tyranny of despondency, and much courage do we need so as to stand
manfully against the feeling, and after gathering from it what is useful, to let the superfluous
go. It hath somewhat useful; for when we ourselves or others sin, then only is it good to
grieve; but when we fall into human vicissitudes, then despondency is useless. And now
when it has overthrown the disciples who were not yet perfect, see how Christ raiseth them
again by His rebuke. They who before this had asked Him ten thousand questions, (for Peter
said, “Whither goest Thou?” <del> c. xiii. 36</del>; and Thomas, “We know not whither Thou goest,
and how can we know the way?” <del> c. xiv. 5 and 8</del>; and Philip, “Show us Thy Father”;) these
men, I say, now hearing, “they will put you out of the synagogues,” and “will hate you,” and
“whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service,” were so cast down as to be
struck dumb, so that they spake nothing to Him. This then He maketh a reproach to them,
and saith, “These things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you; but
now I go unto Him that sent Me, and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? but because
I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.” For a dreadful thing
is immoderate sorrow, dreadful and effective of death. Wherefore Paul said, “Lest perhaps
such a one should be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow.” ( 2 Cor. ii. 7.)</p>
<p>“And these things,” saith He, “I told you not at the beginning.” Why did He not tell
them at the beginning? That none might say that He spake guessing from the ordinary
course of events. And why did He enter on a matter of such unpleasantness? “I knew these
things,” He saith, “from the beginning, and spake not of them; not because I did not know
them, but ‘because I was with you.’” And this again was spoken after a human manner, as
though He had said, “Because ye were in safety, and it was in your power to question Me
when ye would, and all the storm blew upon Me, and it was superfluous to tell you these
things at the beginning.” “But did He not tell them this? Did He not call the twelve, and say
unto them, ‘Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake,’ and, ‘they shall
scourge you in the synagogues’? ( Matt. x. 18, 17 ). How then saith He, ‘I told you not at the
beginning’?” Because He had proclaimed before the scourgings and bringing before princes,
still not that their death should appear so desirable that the action should even be deemed
a service to God. For this more than anything was suited to terrify them, that they were to
be judged as impious and corrupters. This too may be said, that in that place He spake of

<pb n="561"/>
what they should suffer from the Gentiles, but here He hath added in a stronger way the
acts of the Jews also, and told them that it was at their doors.</p>
<p>“But now I go to Him that sent Me, and no man of you saith, Whither goest Thou? But
because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.” It was no slight
comfort to them to learn that He knew the excess of their despondency. For they were beside
themselves from the anguish caused by their being left by Him, and from their awaiting the
terrible things which were to come, since they knew not whether they should be able to bear
them manfully. “Why then after this did He not tell them that they had been vouchsafed
the Spirit?” That thou mightest learn that they were exceedingly virtuous. For if, when they
had not yet been vouchsafed the Spirit, they started not back, though overwhelmed with
sorrow, consider what sort of men they were likely to be after having enjoyed the grace.2224
If they had heard this at that time, and so had endured, we should have attributed the whole
to the Spirit, but now it is entirely the fruit of their own state of mind, it is a clear manifestation
of their love for Christ, who applieth a touchstone to their mind as yet defenseless.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “But I tell you the truth.”2225</p>
<p>Observe how He consoleth them again. “I speak not,” He saith, “to please you, and although
you be grieved ten thousand fold, yet must ye hear what is for your good; it is indeed
to your liking that I should be with you, but what is expedient for you is different. And it is
the part of one caring for others, not to be over gentle with his friends in matters which
concern their interests, or to lead them away from what is good for them.”</p>
<p>“For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come.”2226</p>
<p>What here say those who hold not the fitting opinion concerning the Spirit? Is it “expedient”
that the master depart, and the servant come? Seest thou how great is the honor
of the Spirit?</p>
<p>“But if I depart, I will send Him unto you.” And what the gain?</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “He, when He is come, will reprove2227 the world.”2228</p>
<p>That is, “they shall not do these things unpunished if He come. For indeed, the things
that have been already done, are sufficient to stop their mouths; but when these things are
also done by Him, when doctrines are more perfect and miracles greater, much more shall
they be condemned when they see such things done in My Name, which make the proof of
the Resurrection more certain. For now they are able to say, ‘this is the carpenter’s son,
whose father and mother we know’; but when they see the bands of death loosed, wickedness
<note type="footnote">2224 or, “gift.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2225 “The truth; it is expedient for you that I go away.” N.T.</note>

cast out, natural lameness straightened, devils expelled, abundant supply of the Spirit, and
all this effected by My being called on, what will they say? The Father hath borne witness
of Me, and the Spirit will bear witness also.” Yet He bare witness at the beginning. Yea, and
shall also do it now. But the, “will convince,”</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “Of sin.”2229</p>
<p>This meaneth, “will cut off all their excuses, and show that they have transgressed unpardonably.”</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “Of righteousness, because I go to the2230 Father, and ye see Me no more.”</p>
<p>That is, “I have exhibited a blameless2231 life, and this is the proof, that, ‘I go to the
Father.’” For since they continually urged this against Him, that He was not from God, and
therefore called Him a sinner and transgressor, He saith, that the Spirit shall take from them
this excuse also. “For if My being deemed not to be from God, showeth Me to be a transgressor,
when the Spirit shall have shown that I am gone thither, not merely for a season,
but to abide there, (for the, ‘Ye see Me no more,’ is the expression of one declaring this,)
what will they say then?” Observe how by these two things, their evil suspicion is removed;
since neither doth working miracles belong to a sinner, (for a sinner cannot work them,)
nor doth the being with God continually belong to a sinner. “So that ye can2232 no longer
say, that ‘this man is a sinner,’ that ‘this man is not from God.’”</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.”</p>
<p>Here again He mooteth the argument concerning righteousness, that He had overthrown
His opponent. Now had He been a sinner, He could not have overthrown him; a thing which
not even any just man had been strong enough to do. “But that he hath been condemned
through Me, they shall know who trample on him hereafter, and who clearly know My Resurrection,
which is the mark of Him who condemneth him. For he was not able to hold
Me. And whereas they said that I had a devil, and that I was a deceiver, these things also
shall hereafter appear to be false;2233 for I could not have prevailed against him, had I been
subject to sin; but now he is condemned and cast out.”</p>

<p>“Therefore it is expedient for you that I depart, if ye then will bear them when I departed.”
“And what hath come to pass? Is the Spirit greater than Thou, that now indeed we bear
not, but It will fit us to bear? Is It working more powerful and more perfect?” “Not so; for
He too shall speak My words.” Wherefore He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 13–15.2234 “He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall
He speak; and He will show you things to come. He shall glorify Me; for He shall receive of
Mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are Mine.”2235</p>
<p>For since He had told them, that “‘He shall teach you, and bring to your remembrance’
( c. xiv. 26 ), and shall comfort you in your afflictions,” (which He Himself did not,) and
that “it is expedient for you that I should depart” ( ver. 7 ), and that He should come, and,
“‘now ye are not able to bear’ ( ver. 12 ), but then ye shall be able,” and, that “He shall lead
you into all truth” ( ver. 13 ); lest hearing these things they should suppose the Spirit to be
the greater, and so fall into an extreme opinion of impiety, therefore He saith, “He shall receive
of Mine,” that is, “whatsoever things I have told you, He shall also tell you.” When He
saith, “He shall speak nothing of Himself,” He meaneth, “nothing contrary, nothing of His
own opposed to My words.” As then in saying respecting Himself, “I speak not of Myself”
( c. xiv. 10 ), He meaneth that He speaketh nothing beside what the Father saith, nothing
of His own against Him, or differing from Him, so also with respect to the Spirit. But the,
“of Mine,” meaneth, “of what I know,” “of My own knowledge”; “for the knowledge of Me
and of the Spirit is one.”</p>
<p>“And He will tell you things to come.” He excited their minds, for the race of man is
for nothing so greedy,2236 as for learning the future. This, for instance, they continually
asked Him, “Whither goest Thou?” “Which is the way?” To free them therefore from this
anxiety, He saith, “He shall foretell you all things, so that ye shall not meet with them without
warning.”</p>
<p>“He shall glorify Me.” How? “In My name He shall grant His inward workings.” For
since at the coming of the Spirit they were about to do greater miracles, therefore, again
introducing the Equality of Honor, He saith, “He shall glorify Me.”</p>
<p>What meaneth He by, “all truth”? for this also He testifieth of Him, that “He shall guide
us into all truth.” ( Ver. 13.) Because He was clothed with the flesh, and because He would
not seem to speak concerning Himself, and because they did not yet know clearly concerning

ally, nor plainly drew them away from the Law. But when the disciples were cut off from
them,2237 and were for the future without; and when many were about to believe, and to be
released from their sins; and when there were others who spake of Him, He with good
reason spake not great things concerning Himself. “So that it proceeded not from ignorance
of Mine,” He saith, “that I told you not what I should have told you, but from the infirmity
of the hearers.” On this account having said, “He shall lead you into all truth,” He added,
“He shall not speak of Himself.” For to show that the Spirit needeth not teaching, hear Paul
saying, “So also the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.” ( 1 Cor. ii. 11.)
“As then the spirit of man, not learning from another, knoweth; so also the Holy Spirit ‘shall
receive of Mine,’” that is, “shall speak in unison with what is Mine.”</p>
<p>“All things that the Father hath are Mine.” “Since then those things are Mine, and He
shall speak from the things of the Father, He shall speak from Mine.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “But why did not the Spirit come before He departed?” Because the curse not having
yet been taken away, sin not yet loosed, but all being yet subject to vengeance, He could not
come. “It is necessary then,” saith He, “that the enmity be put away, that we be reconciled
to God, and then receive that Gift.” But why saith He, “I will send Him”? ( Ver. 7.) It meaneth,
“I will prepare you beforehand to receive Him.” For, how can that which Is everywhere, be
“sent”? Besides, He also showeth the distinction of the Persons. On these two accounts He
thus speaketh; and also, since they were hardly to be drawn away from Himself, exhorting
them to hold fast to the Spirit, and in order that they might cherish It. For He Himself was
able to have wrought these things, but He concedeth to the Spirit2238 the working of miracles,
2239 on this account, that they might understand His2240 dignity. For as the Father
could have brought into being things which are, yet the Son did so, that we might understand
His power, so also is it in this case. On this account He Himself was made Flesh, reserving
the inward working2241 for the Spirit, shutting up the mouths of those who take the argument
of His ineffable love for an occasion of impiety. For when they say that the Son was made
flesh because He was inferior to the Father, we will reply to them, “what then will ye say of
the Spirit?” He took not the flesh, and yet certainly on this account ye will not call Him
greater than the Son, nor the Son inferior to Him. Therefore, in the case of baptism also the
Trinity is included. The Father is able to effect the whole, as is the Son, and the Holy Ghost;
yet, since concerning the Father no man doubts, but the doubt was concerning the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, They are included in the rite, that by Their community in supplying those

<note type="footnote">2241 al. “nobleness.”</note>

<pb n="565"/>
unspeakable blessings, we may also fully learn Their community in dignity. For that both
the Son is able by Himself to do that which in the case of baptism2242 He is able to do with
the Father, and the Holy Ghost the same, hear these things said plainly. For to the Jews He
said, “That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins” ( Mark
ii. 10 ); and again, “That ye may become children of light” ( c. xii. 36 ): and, “I give to them
eternal life.” ( c. x. 28.) Then after this, “That they might have life, and might have it more
abundantly.” ( c. x. 10.) Now let us see the Spirit also performing the same thing. Where
can we see it? “But the manifestation of the Spirit,” it saith, “is given to every man to profit
withal” ( 1 Cor. xii. 7; c. vi. 63 ); He then that giveth these things, much more remitteth sins.
And again, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth”; and, “Shall quicken you2243 by His Spirit which
dwelleth in you” ( Rom. viii. 11 ); and, “The Spirit is Life because of righteousness” ( Rom.
viii. 10 ); and, “If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.” ( Gal. v. 18.) “For ye
have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption.”
( Rom. viii. 15.) All the wonders too which they then wrought, they wrought at the
coming of the Spirit. And Paul writing to the Corinthians, said, “But ye have been washed,
but ye have been sanctified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,2244 and by the Spirit of
our God.” ( 1 Cor. vi. 11.) Since then they had heard many things of the Father, and had
seen the Son work many things, but as yet knew nothing clearly of the Spirit, that Spirit
doeth miracles, and bringeth in the perfect knowledge. But (as I said before) that He may
not thence be supposed to be greater, on this account Christ saith, “Whatsoever He shall
hear, that shall He speak; and He will show you things to come.” Since, if this be not so, how
could it be otherwise than absurd, if He was about to hear then, and on account of those
who were being made disciples? For according to you,2245 He would not even then know,
except on account of those who were about to hear. What could be more unlawful than this
saying? Besides, what would He have to hear? Did He not speak2246 all these things by the
Prophets? For if He was about to teach concerning the dissolution of the Law, it had been
spoken of: if concerning Christ, His Divinity and the Dispensation, these had been spoken
of also. What could He say more clearly after this?</p>
<p>“And shall show you things to come.” Here most of all Christ showeth His2247 Dignity,
for to foretell things to come is especially the property of God. Now if He2248 also learn this

<pb n="566"/>
from others, He will have nothing more than the Prophets, but here Christ declareth a
knowledge brought into exact accordance with God, that it is impossible that He should
speak anything else. But the, “shall receive of Mine,” meaneth, “shall receive, either of the
grace2249 which came into My Flesh, or of the knowledge which I also have, not as needing
it, nor as learning it from another, but because it is One and the same.” “And wherefore
spake He thus, and not otherwise?” Because they understand not yet the word concerning
the Spirit, wherefore He provideth for one thing only, that the Spirit should be believed and
received by them, and that they should not be offended. For since He had said, “One is your
Teacher, even Christ” ( Matt. xxiii. 10 ), that they might not deem that they should disobey
Him in obeying the Spirit, He saith, “His teaching and Mine are One; of what I should have
taught, of those things shall He also speak. Do not suppose His words are other than Mine,
for those words are Mine, and confirm My opinion.2250 For One is the will of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Thus also He willeth us to be, when He saith, “That
they may be one, as Thou and I are One.”2251 ( c. xvii. 11.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> There is nothing equal to unanimity and concord; for so one is manifold. If two or
ten are of one mind, the one is one no longer, but each one is multiplied tenfold, and thou
wilt find the one in the ten, and the ten in the one; and if they have an enemy, he who attacks
the one, as having attacked the ten, is vanquished; for he is the mark not for one, but for ten
opponents.2252 Is one in want? No, he is not in want, for he is wealthy in his greater part,
that is, in the nine; and the needy part, the lesser, is concealed by the wealthy part, the
greater. Each of these hath twenty hands, twenty eyes, and as many feet. For he sees not
with his own eyes alone, but with those of others; he walks2253 not with his own feet alone,
but with those of others; he works not with his own hands alone, but with theirs. He hath
ten souls, for not only doth he take thought for himself, but those souls also for him. And
if they be made a hundred, it will still be the same, and their power will be extended. Seest
thou the excess of love, how it makes the one both irresistible and manifold, how one can
even be in many places, the same both in Persia and in Rome, and that what nature cannot
do, love can? for one part of him will be here, and one there, or rather he will be wholly here
and wholly there. If then he have a thousand or two thousand friends, consider again
whither his power will extend. Seest thou what an increase-giving thing is love? for the
wonderful thing is this, its making one a thousand. Why then do we not acquire this power
and place ourselves in safety? This is better than all power or riches, 2254 this is more than

<pb n="567"/>
health, than light itself, it is the groundwork of good courage. How long do we set our love
on one or two? Consider also the action in the contrary way. Suppose a man without a friend,
a mark of the utmost folly, (for a fool will say, “I have no friend,”) what sort of life will such
a one lead? For though he be infinitely rich, in plenty and luxury, possessed of ten thousand
good things, yet is he desolate and bare of all. But in the case of friends not so; though they
be poor men, yet are they better provided than the wealthy; and the things which a man
undertakes not to say for himself, a friend will say for him, and whatever gratifications he
is not able to procure for himself, he will be enabled to obtain by means of another, and
much more; and it will be to us the groundwork of all enjoyment and safety, since one who
is guarded by so many spearmen cannot suffer harm. For the king’s body guards are not
equal in their strictness to these. The one perform their watch through compulsion and fear,
the others through kindness and love; and love is far mightier than fear. The king fears his
own guards; the friend is more confident in them than in himself, and by reason of them
fears none of those that plot against him. Let us then engage in this traffic; the poor man,
that he may have consolation in his poverty; the rich, that he may possess his wealth in
safety; the ruler, that he may rule with safety; 2255 the ruled, that he may have benevolent
rulers. This is the source of kindness, this the groundwork of gentleness; since even among
beasts, those are the most fierce and untamable which are not gregarious. For this cause we
dwell in cities, and have public places, that we may converse with one another. This also
Paul commanded, saying, “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together” ( Heb. x. 25
); for no evil is so great as solitariness, and the state which is without compact and intercourse.
“What then,” saith some one, “of the solitaries, and of those who have occupied the summits
of the mountains?” That neither are they without friends; they have indeed fled from the
turmoil of common life, but they have many of one soul with them, and closely bound together
one to another; and they have retired that they might rightly accomplish this thing.2256
For since the rivalry of business causes many disputes, therefore, removing from among
men, they cultivate2257 love with much exactness. “But how,” saith some one, “if a man be
alone can he have ten thousand friends?” I, for my part, desire, if it be possible, that men
should know how to dwell one with another; but for the present let the properties of
friendship remain unshaken.2258 For it is not place which makes friends. They, for instance,
have many who admire them; now these would not have admired had they not loved them.
Again, they pray for all the world, which is the greatest proof of friendship. For this cause
we salute one another at the Mysteries, that being many we may become one; and in the

case of the uninitiated,2259 we make our prayers common, supplicating for the sick, and for
the produce of the world, for land and sea. Seest thou all the power of love? in the prayers,
in the Mysteries, in the exhortations? This is that which causeth all good things. If we hold
carefully to this, we shall both rightly dispense things present, and also obtain the Kingdom;
which may we all obtain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xvi. 16, 17</p>
<p>“A little while, and ye shall not see2260 Me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see Me, because
I go to the Father. Then said some of His disciples among themselves, What is this
that He saith?” <del>And what follows.2261</del></p>
<p><del>1.</del> Nothing is wont so to cast down the soul that is anguished and possessed by deep
despondency, as when words which cause pain are continually dwelt upon. Why then did
Christ, after saying, “I go,” and, “Hereafter I will not speak with you,” continually dwell on
the same subject, saying, “A little while, and ye shall not see Me, because I go to Him that
sent Me”?2262 When He had recovered them by His words concerning the Spirit, He again
casteth down their courage. Wherefore doth He this? He testeth their feelings, and rendereth
them more proved, and well accustometh them by hearing sad things, manfully to bear
separation from Him; for they who had practiced this when spoken of in words, were likely
in actions also, easily to bear it afterwards. And if one enquire closely, this very thing is a
consolation, 2263 the saying that, “I go to the Father.” For it is the expression of One, who
declares that He shall not perish, but that His end is a kind of translation. He addeth too
another consolation; for He saith not merely, “A little while, and ye shall not see Me,” but
also, “A little while, and ye shall see Me”; showing that He will both come to them again,
and that their separation would be but for a little while, and His presence with them continual.
This, however, they did not understand. Whence one may with reason wonder how,
after having often heard these things, they doubt, as though they had heard nothing. How
then is it that they did not understand? It was either through grief, as I suppose, for that
drove what was said from their understanding; or through the obscurity of the words. Because
He seemed to them to set forth two contraries, which were not contrary. “If,” saith one of
them, “we shall see Thee, whither goest Thou? And if Thou goest, how shall we see Thee?”
Therefore they say, “We cannot tell what He saith.” That He was about to depart, they knew;
but they knew not that He would shortly come to them. On which account He rebuketh
them, because they did not understand His saying. For, desiring to infix in2264 them the
doctrine concerning His death, what saith He?</p>
<note type="footnote">2260 al. “ye no longer see.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2261 Part of ver. 17 and ver. 18. “A little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and ye shall

<p>Ver. 20.2265 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament”—which belonged
to the Death and the Cross—“but the world shall rejoice.”</p>
<p>Because by reason of their not desiring His death, they quickly ran into the belief that
He would not die, and then when they heard that He would die, cast about, not knowing
what that “little” meant, He saith, “Ye shall mourn and lament.”</p>
<p>“But your sorrow shall be turned into joy.”2266 Then having shown that after grief comes
joy, and that grief gendereth joy, and that grief is short, but the pleasure endless, He passeth
to a common2267 example; and what saith He?</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow.”2268</p>
<p>And He hath used a comparison which the Prophets also use continually, likening despondencies
to the exceeding pains of childbirth. But what He saith is of this kind: “Travail
pains shall lay hold on you, but the pang of childbirth is the cause of joy”; both confirming
His words relative to the Resurrection, and showing that the departing hence is like passing
from the womb into the light of day. As though He had said, “Marvel not that I bring you
to your advantage through such sorrow, since even a mother to become a mother, passeth
in like manner through pain.” Here also He implieth something mystical, that He hath
loosened the travail pangs of death, and caused a new man to be born of them.2269 And He
said not, that the pain shall pass away only, but, “she doth not even remember it,” so great
is the joy which succeedeth; so also shall it be with the Saints. And yet the woman doth not
rejoice because “a man hath come into the world,” but because a son hath been born to her;
since, had this been the case, nothing would have hindered the barren from rejoicing over
another who beareth. Why then spake He thus? Because He introduced this example for
this purpose only, to show that sorrow is for a season, but joy lasting: and to show that
(death) is a translation unto life; and to show the great profit of their pangs. He said not, “a
child hath been born,” but, “A man.” For to my mind He here alludeth to His own Resurrection,
and that He should be born not unto that death which bare the birth-pang, but
unto the Kingdom. Therefore He said not, “a child hath been born unto her,” but, “A man
hath been born into the world.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2265 Ver. 19 , omitted. “Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask Him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire

<p>Ver. 22, 23.2270 “And ye now therefore have sorrow—<del>but I will see you again, and your
sorrow shall be turned into joy</del>.”2271 Then, to show that He shall die no more, He saith,
“And no man taketh it from you. And in that day ye shall ask Me nothing.”</p>
<p>Again He proveth nothing else by these words, but that He is from God. “For then ye
shall for the time to come know all things.” But what is, “Ye shall not ask Me”? “Ye shall
need no intercessor, but it is sufficient that ye call on My Name, and so gain all things.”</p>
<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask My Father in My Name.”2272</p>
<p>He showeth the power of His Name, if at least being neither seen nor called upon, but
only named, He even maketh us approved2273 by the Father. But where hath this taken
place? Where they say, “Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto Thy servants that
with boldness they may speak Thy word” ( Acts iv. 29, 31 ), “and work miracles in Thy
Name.” “And the place was shaken where they were.”</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Hitherto ye have asked nothing.”2274</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Hence He showeth it to be good that He should depart, if hitherto they had asked
nothing, and if then they should receive all things whatsoever they should ask. “For do not
suppose, because I shall no longer be with you, that ye are deserted; My Name shall give
you greater boldness.” Since then the words which He had used had been veiled, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when
I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs.”</p>
<p>“There shall be a time when ye shall know all things clearly.” He speaketh of the time
of the Resurrection. “Then,”</p>
<p>“I shall tell you plainly of the Father.”</p>
<p>(For He was with them, and talked with them forty days, being assembled with them,
and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God— Acts i. 3, 4 ,)—“because now
being in fear, ye give no heed to My words; but then when ye see Me risen again, and converse
with Me, ye will be able to learn all things plainly, for the Father Himself will love you, when
your faith in Me hath been made firm.”</p>

<p>“Your love for Me sufficeth to be your advocate.”</p>
<p>Ver. 27, 28. “Because2276 ye have loved Me, and have believed that I came out from
God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world,
and go to the Father.”</p>
<p>For since His discourse concerning the Resurrection, and together with this, the hearing
that “I came out from God, and thither I go,” gave them no common comfort, He continually
handleth these things. He gave a pledge, in the first place, that they were right in believing
on Him; in the second, that they should be in safety. When therefore He said, “A little while,
and ye shall not see Me; and again a little while, and ye shall see Me” ( ver. 17 ), they with
reason did not understand Him. But now it is no longer so. What then is, “Ye shall not ask
Me”? “Ye shall not say, ‘Show us the Father,’ and, ‘Whither goest Thou?’ for ye shall know
all knowledge, and the Father shall be disposed towards you even as I am.” It was this especially
which made them breathe again, the learning that they should be the Father’s friends
wherefore they say,</p>
<p>Ver. 30.2277 “Now we know that Thou knowest all things.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that He made answer to what was secretly harboring2278 in their minds?</p>
<p>“And needest not that any man should ask Thee.”2279</p>
<p>That is, “Before hearing, Thou knowest the things which made us stumble, and Thou
hast given us rest, since Thou hast said, ‘The Father loveth you, because ye have loved Me.’”
After so many and so great matters, they say, “Now we know.” Seest thou in what an imperfect
state they were? Then, when, as though conferring a favor upon Him, they say, “Now we
know,” He replieth, “Ye still require many other things to come to perfection; nothing is as
yet achieved by you. Ye shall presently betray Me to My enemies, and such fear shall seize
you, that ye shall not even be able to retire one with another, yet from this I shall suffer
nothing dreadful.” Seest thou again how con descending His speech is? And indeed He
makes this a charge against them, that they continually needed condescension. For when
they say, “Lo, now Thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable” ( ver. 29 ), “and therefore
we believe Thee,” He showeth them that now, when they believe, they do not yet believe,
neither doth He accept their words. This He saith, referring them to another season. But

<pb n="573"/>
<p>Ver. 32.2280 “The Father is with Me,” He hath again put on their account; for this they2281
everywhere wished to learn. Then, to show that He did not give them perfect knowledge by
saying this, but in order that their reason might not rebel, (for it was probable that they
might form some human ideas, and think that they should not enjoy any assistance from
Him,) He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 33. “These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace.”2282</p>
<p>That is, “that ye should not cast Me from your thoughts, but receive Me.” Let no one,
then, drag these words into a doctrine; they are spoken for our comfort and love. “For not
even when we suffer such things as I have mentioned shall your troubles stop there,2283 but
as long as ye are in the world ye shall have sorrow, not only now when I am betrayed, but
also afterwards. But rouse your minds, for ye shall suffer nothing terrible. When the master
hath gotten the better of his enemies, the disciples must not despond.” “And how,” tell me,
“hast Thou ‘conquered the world’?” I have told you already, that I have cast down its ruler,
but ye shall know hereafter, when all things yield and give place to you.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But it is permitted to us also to conquer, looking to the Author of our faith, and
walking on that road which He cut for us. So neither shall death get the mastery of us. “What
then, shall we not die?” saith some one. Why, from this very thing2284 it is clear that he shall
not gain the mastery over us. The champion truly will then be glorious, not when he hath
not closed with his opponent, but when having closed he is not holden by him. We therefore
are not mortal, because of our struggle with death, but immortal, because of our victory;
then should we have been mortal, had we remained with him always. As then I should not
call the longest-lived animals immortal, although they long remain free from death, so
neither him who shall rise after death mortal, because he is dissolved by death. For, tell me,
if a man blush a little, should we say that he was continually ruddy? Not so, for the action
is not a habit. If one become pale, should we call him jaundiced? No, for the affection is but
temporary. And so you would not call him mortal, who hath been for but a short time in
the hands of death. Since in this way we may speak of those who sleep, for they are dead, so
to say, and without action. But doth death corrupt our bodies? What of that? It is not that
they may remain in corruption, but that they be made better. Let us then conquer the world,
let us run to immortality, let us follow our King, let us too set up a trophy,2285 let us despise

the world’s pleasures. We need no toil to do so; let us transfer our souls to2286 heaven, and
all the world is conquered. If thou desirest it not, it is conquered; if thou deride it, it is
worsted. Strangers are we and sojourners, let us then not grieve at any of its painful things.
For if, being sprung from a renowned country, and from illustrious ancestors, thou hadst
gone into some distant land, being known to no one, having with thee neither servants nor
wealth, and then some one had insulted thee, thou wouldest not grieve as though thou hadst
suffered these things at home. For the knowing clearly that thou wast in a strange and foreign
land, would persuade thee to bear all easily, and to despise hunger, and thirst, and any suffering
whatever. Consider this also now, that thou art a stranger and a sojourner, and let
nothing disturb thee in this foreign land; for thou hast a City whose Artificer and Creator
is God, and the2287 sojourning itself is but for a short and little time. Let whoever will strike,
insult, revile; we are in a strange land, and live but meanly; the dreadful thing would be, to
suffer so in our own country, before our fellow-citizens, then is the greatest unseemliness
and loss. For if a man be where he had none that knows him, he endures all easily, because
insult becomes more grievous from the intention of those who offer it. For instance, if a
man insult the governor, knowing that he is governor, then the insult is bitter; but if he insult,
supposing him to be a private man, he cannot even touch him who undergoeth the insult.
So let us reason also. For neither do our revilers know what we are, as, that we are citizens
of heaven, registered for the country which is above, fellow-choristers of the Cherubim. Let
us not then grieve nor deem their insult to be insult; had they known, they would not have
insulted us. Do they deem us poor and mean? Neither let us count this an insult. For tell
me, if a traveler having got before his servants, were sitting a little space in the inn waiting
for them, and then the innkeeper, or some travelers, should behave rudely to him, and revile
him, would he not laugh at the other’s ignorance? would not their mistake rather give him
pleasure? would he not feel a satisfaction as though not he but some one else were insulted?
Let us too behave thus. We too sit in an inn, waiting for our friends who travel the same
road; when we are all collected, then they shall know whom they insult. These men then
shall hang2288 their heads; then they shall say, “This is he whom we” fools “had in derision.”
( Wisd. v. 3.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> With these two things then let us comfort ourselves, that we are not insulted, for
they know not who we are, and that, if we wish to obtain satisfaction, they shall hereafter
give us a most bitter one. But God forbid that any should have a soul so cruel and inhuman.
“What then if we be insulted by our kinsmen? For this is the burdensome thing.” Nay, this
is the light thing. “Why, pray?” Because we do not bear those whom we love when they insult

<note type="footnote">2287 al. “and if the.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2288 al. “then hang.”</note>

<pb n="575"/>
us, in the same way as we bear those whom we do not know. For instance, in consoling those
who have been injured, we often say, “It is a brother who hath injured you, bear it nobly; it
is a father; it is an uncle.” But if the name of “father” and “brother” puts you to shame, much
more if I name to you a relationship more intimate than these; for we are not only brethren
one to another, but also members, and one body. Now if the name of brother shame you,
much more that of member. Hast thou not heard that Gentile proverb, which saith, that “it
behooveth to keep friends with their defects”? Hast thou not heard Paul say, “Bear ye one
another’s burdens”? Seest thou not lovers? For I am compelled, since I cannot draw an instance
from you, to bring my discourse to that ground of argument. This also Paul doth,
thus saying, “Furthermore we have had fathers in our flesh, which corrected us, and we gave
them reverence.” ( Heb. xii. 9 .) Or rather, that is more apt which he saith to the Romans,
“As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity,
even so now yield your members servants to righteousness.” For this reason let us confidently
keep hold of2289 the illustration. Now dost thou not observe lovers, what miseries these
suffer when inflamed with desire for harlots, cuffed, beaten, and laughed at, enduring a
harlot, who turns away from and insults them in ten thousand ways; yet if they see but once
anything sweet or gentle, all is well to do with them, all former things are gone, all goes on
with a fair wind, be it poverty, be it sickness, be it anything else besides these. For they count
their own life as miserable or blessed, according as they may have her whom they love disposed
towards them. They know nothing of mortal honor or disgrace, but even if one insult,
they bear all easily through the great pleasure and delight which they receive from her; and
though she revile, though she spit in their face, they think, when they are enduring this, that
they are being pelted with roses. And what wonder, if such are their feelings as to her person?
for her very house they think to be more splendid than any, though it be but of mud, though
it be falling down. But why speak I of walls? when they even see the places which they frequent
in the evening, they are excited. Allow me now for what follows to speak the word of the
Apostle. As he saith, “As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, so yield
your members servants unto righteousness”; so in like manner now I say, “as we have loved
these women, let us love one another, and we shall not think that we suffer anything terrible.”
2290 And why say I, “one another”? Let us so love God. Do ye shudder, when ye hear
that I require as much love in the case of God, as we have shown towards a harlot? But I
shudder that we do not show even thus much. And, if you will, let us go on with the argument,
though what is said be very painful. The woman beloved promises her lovers nothing good,
but dishonor, shame, and insolence. For this is what the waiting upon a harlot makes a man,
ridiculous, shameful, dishonored. But God promiseth us heaven, and the good things which
<note type="footnote">2289 al. “we touch.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2290 i.e. in being insulted.</note>

<pb n="576"/>
are in heaven; He hath made us sons, and brethren of the Only-begotten, and hath given
thee ten thousand things while living, and when thou diest, resurrection, and promiseth
that He will give us such good things as it is not possible even to imagine, and maketh us
honored and revered. Again, that woman compels her lovers to spend all their substance
for the pit and for destruction; but God biddeth us sow the heaven, and giveth us an hundredfold,
and eternal life. Again, she uses her lover like a slave, giving commands more hardly
than any tyrant; but God saith, “I no longer call you servants, but friends.” ( c. xv. 15.)</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Have ye seen the excess both of the evils here and the blessings there2291 ? What
then comes next? For this woman’s sake, many lie awake, and whatever she commands,
readily obey; give up house, and father, and mother, and friends, and money, and patronage,
and leave all that belongs to them in want and desolation; but for the sake of God, or rather
for the sake of ourselves, we often do not choose to expend even the third portion of our
substance, but we look on the hungry, we overlook him, and run past the naked, and do not
even bestow a word upon him. But the lovers, if they see but a little servant girl of their
mistress, and her a barbarian, they stand in the middle of the market-place, and talk with
her, as if they were proud and glad to do so, unrolling an interminable round of words;2292
and for her sake they count all their living as nothing, deem rulers and rule nothing, (they
know it, all who have had experience of the malady,) and thank her more when she commands,
than others when they serve. Is there not with good reason a hell? Are there not
with good reason ten thousand punishments? Let us then become sober, let us apply to the
service of God as much, or half, or even the third part of what others supply to the harlot.
Perhaps again ye shudder; for so do I myself. But I would not that ye should shudder at
words only, but at the actions; as it is, here indeed our2293 hearts are made orderly, but we
go forth and cast all away. What then is the gain? For there, if it be required to spend money,
no one laments his poverty, but even borrows it to give, perchance, when smitten. But here,
if we do but mention almsgiving, they pretend to us children, and wife, and house, and
patronage, and ten thousand excuses. “But,” saith some one, “the pleasure is great there.”
This it is that I lament and mourn. What if I show that the pleasure here is greater? For there
shame, and insult, and expense, cut away no little of the pleasure, and after these the quarreling
and enmity; but here there is nothing of the kind. What is there, tell me, equal to this
pleasure, to sit expecting heaven and the kingdom there, and the glory of the saints, and the
life that is endless? “But these things,” saith some one, “are in expectation, the others in experience.”
What kind of experience? Wilt thou that I tell thee the pleasures which are here
<note type="footnote">2291 al. “thence.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2292 μακρῶν λόγων ἀνελίττοντες διαύλους. The δίαυλος was the double course, which ended where it
began.</note>
<note type="footnote">2293 al. “your.”</note>

<pb n="577"/>
also by experience? Consider what freedom thou enjoyest, and how thou fearest and tremblest
at no man when thou livest in company with virtue, neither enemy, nor plotter, nor informer,
nor rival in credit or in love, nor envious person, nor poverty, nor sickness, nor any other
human thing. But there, although ten thousand things be according to thy mind, though
riches flow in as from a fountain, yet the war with rivals, and the plots, and ambuscades,
will make more miserable than any the life of him who wallows with those women.2294 For
when that abominable one is haughty, and insolent, you needs must kindle quarrel to flatter
her. This therefore is more grievous than ten thousand deaths, more intolerable than any
punishment. But here there is nothing of the kind. For “the fruit,” it saith, “of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace.” ( Gal. v. 22.) Here is no quarreling, nor unseasonable pecuniary expense,
nor disgrace and expense too; and if thou give but a farthing, or a loaf, or a cup of cold water,
He will be much beholden to thee, and He doth nothing to pain or grieve thee, but all so as
to make thee glorious, and free thee from all shame. What defense therefore shall we have,
what pardon shall we gain, if, leaving these things, we give ourselves up to the contrary, and
voluntarily cast ourselves into the furnace that burns with fire? Wherefore I exhort those
who are sick of this malady, to recover themselves, and return to health, and not allow
themselves to fall into despair. Since that son2295 also was in a far more grievous state than
this, yet when he returned to his father’s house, he came to his former honor, and appeared
more glorious than him who had ever been well-pleasing. Let us also imitate him, and returning
to our Father, even though it be late, let us depart from that captivity, and transfer
ourselves to freedom, that we may enjoy the Kingdom of heaven, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xvii. 1</p>
<p>“These words spake Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to heaven, and saith, Father, the hour is come;
glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “He that hath done and taught,”2296 it saith, “the same shall be called great in the
Kingdom of heaven.” And with much reason; for to show true wisdom in words, is easy,
but the proof which is by works is the part of some noble and great one. Wherefore also
Christ, speaking of the endurance of evil, putteth Himself forth, bidding us take example
from Him. On this account too, after this admonition, He betaketh Himself to prayer,
teaching us in our temptations to leave all things, and flee to God. For because He had said,
“In the world ye shall have tribulation,” and had shaken their souls, by the prayer He raiseth
them again. As yet they gave heed unto Him as to a man; and for their sake He acteth thus,
just as He did in the case of Lazarus, and there telleth the reason; “Because of the people
that stand by I said it, that they might believe that Thou hast sent Me.” ( c. xi. 42.) “Yea,”
saith some one, “this took place with good cause in the case of the Jews; but wherefore in
that of the disciples?” With good cause in the case of the disciples also. For they who, after
all that had been said and done, said, “Now we know that Thou knowest” ( c. xvi. 30 ), most
of all needed to be established. Besides, the Evangelist doth not even call the action prayer;
but what saith he? “He lifted up His eyes to heaven,” and saith rather that it was a discoursing
with the Father. And if elsewhere he speaks of prayer, and at one time shows Him kneeling
on His knees, at another lifting His eyes to heaven, be not thou troubled; for by these means
we are taught the earnestness which should be in our petitions, that standing we should
look up, not with the eyes of the flesh only, but of the mind, and that we should bend our
knees, bruising our own hearts. For Christ came not merely to manifest Himself, but also
about to teach virtue ineffable. But it behooveth the teacher to teach, not by words only, but
also by actions. Let us hear then what He saith in this place.</p>
<p>“Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.”</p>
<p>Again He showeth us, that not unwilling He cometh to the Cross. For how could He be
unwilling, who prayed that this might come to pass, and called the action “glory,” not only
for Himself the Crucified, but also for the Father? since this was the case, for not the Son
only, but the Father also was glorified. For before the Crucifixion, not even the Jews knew
Him;2297 “Israel,” it saith, “hath not known Me” ( Isa. i. 3 ); but after the Crucifixion, all the
<note type="footnote">2296 “Whosoever shall do,” U+0026c., N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2297 i.e. the Father.</note>

<pb n="579"/>
world ran to Him. Then He speaketh also of the manner of the glory, and how He will
glorify Him.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “As Thou hast given Him power over all flesh,” “that nothing which Thou hast
given Him should perish.”2298</p>
<p>For to be always doing good, is glory to God. But what is, “As Thou hast given Him
power over all flesh”? He now showeth, that what belongs to the preaching is not confined
to the Jews alone, but is extended to all the world, and layeth down beforehand the first invitations
to the Gentiles. And since He had said, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles” (
Matt. x. 5 ), and after this time is about to say, “Go ye, and make disciples of all nations” (
Matt. xxviii. 19 ), He showeth that the Father also willeth this. For this greatly offended the
Jews, and the disciples too; nor indeed after this did they easily endure to lay hold on the
Gentiles, until they received the teaching of the Spirit; because hence arose no small stumblingblock
for the Jews. Therefore, when Peter after such a manifestation of the Spirit came
to Jerusalem, he could scarcely, by relating the vision of the sheet, escape the charges brought
against him. But what is, “Thou hast given Him power over all flesh”? I will ask the heretics,
“When did He receive this power? was it before He formed them, or after?” He himself saith,
that it was after that He had been crucified,2299 and had risen again; at least then He said,
“All power is given unto Me” ( Matt. xxviii. 18 ), and, “Go ye and make disciples of all nations.”
What then, had He not authority over His own works? Did He make them, and had
He not authority over them after having made them? Yet He is seen doing all in times of
old, punishing some as sinners,2300 (for, “Surely I will not hide,” it saith, “from My servant
Abraham, that which I am about to do”— Gen. xviii. 17 , LXX.,) and honoring others as
righteous. Had He then the power at that time, and now had He lost it, and did He again
receive it? What devil could assert this? But if His power was the same both then and now,
(for, saith He, “as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will”— c. v. 21 ,) what is the meaning of the words? He was about to
send them to the Gentiles; in order therefore that they might not think that this was an innovation,
because He had said, “I am not sent, save unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel”
( Matt. xv. 24 ), He showeth that this seemeth good to the Father also. And if He saith this
with great meanness of circumstance, it is not wonderful. For so He edified both those at
that time, and those who came afterwards; and as I have before said, He always by the excess
of meanness firmly persuaded them that the words were those of condescension.</p>
<note type="footnote">2298 N.T. “That He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2299 Morel. “had been made flesh.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2300 Some mss. add, “and setting right some who turn.”</note>

<pb n="580"/>
<p><del>2.</del> But what is, “Of all flesh”? For certainly not all believed. Yet, for His part, all believed;
and if men gave no heed to His words, the fault was not in the teacher, but in those who
received them not.</p>
<p>“That He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.”</p>
<p>If here also He speaketh in a more human manner, wonder not. For He doth so both
on account of the reasons I have given, and to avoid the saying anything great concerning
Himself; since this was a stumblingblock to the hearers because as yet they imagined nothing
great concerning Him. John, for example, when He speaks in his own person, doth not so,
but leadeth up his language to greater sublimity, saying, “All things were made by Him, and
without Him was not anything made” ( c. i. 3, 4, 9, 11 ); and that He was “Life”; and that He
was “Light”; and that “He came to His own”: he saith not, that He would not have had power,
had He not received it, but that He gave to others also “power to become sons of God.” And
Paul in like manner calleth Him equal with God. But He Himself asketh in a more human
way, saying thus, “That He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.” (
Philip. ii. 6 .)</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</p>
<p>“The only true God,” He saith, by way of distinction from those which are not gods; for
He was about to send them to the Gentiles. But if they2301 will not allow this, but on account
of this word “only” reject the Son from being true God, in this way as they proceed they reject
Him from being God at all.2302 For He also saith, “Ye seek not the glory which is from the
only God.” ( c. v. 44.) Well then; shall not the Son be God? But if the Son be God, and the
Son of the Father who is called the Only God, it is clear that He also is true, and the Son of
Him who is called the Only true God. Why, when Paul saith, “Or I only and Barnabas” ( 1
Cor. ix. 6 ), doth he exclude Barnabas? Not at all; for the “only” is put by way of distinction
from others. And, if He be not true God, how is He “Truth”? for truth far surpasses what is
true. What shall we call the not being a “true” man, tell me? shall we not call it the not being
a man at all? so if the Son is not true God, how is He God? And how maketh He us gods
and sons, if He is not true? But on these matters we have spoken more particularly in another
place; wherefore let us apply ourselves to what follows.</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “I have glorified Thee on the earth.” Well said He, “on the earth”; for in heaven
He had been already glorified, having His own natural glory, and being worshiped by the
Angels. Christ then speaketh not of that glory which is bound up with His2303 Essence, (for
that glory, though none glorify Him, He ever possesseth in its fullness,) but of that which
<note type="footnote">2301 i.e. the heretics: some mss. τὸ μόνον</note>
<note type="footnote">2302 al. “even reject God.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2303 i.e. the Father’s.</note>

<pb n="581"/>
cometh from the service of men. And so the, “Glorify Me,” is of this kind; and that thou
mayest understand that He speaketh of this manner of glory, hear what follows.</p>
<p>“I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me that I should do it.”</p>
<p>And yet the action was still but beginning, or rather was not yet beginning. How then
said He, “I have finished”? Either He meaneth, that “I have done all My part”; or He speaketh
of the future, as having already come to pass; or, which one may say most of all, that all was
already effected, because the root of blessings had been laid, which fruits would certainly
and necessarily follow, and from His being2304 present at and assisting in those things which
should take place after these. On this account He saith again in a condescending way, “Which
Thou gavest Me.” For had He indeed waited to hear and learn, this would have fallen far
short of His glory. For that He came to this2305 of His own will, is clear from many passages.
As when Paul saith, that “He so loved us, as to give Himself for us” ( Eph. v. 2 ); and, “He
emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant” ( Philip. ii. 7 ); and, “As the
Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you.” ( c. xv. 9.)</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine Own Self,2306 with the glory
which I had with Thee before the world was.”</p>
<p>Where is that glory? For allowing that He was2307 with reason unhonored among men,
because of the covering2308 which was put around Him; how seeketh He2309 to be glorified
with the Father? What then saith He here? The saying refers to the Dispensation; since His
fleshly nature had not yet been glorified, not having as yet enjoyed incorruption, nor shared
the kingly throne. Therefore He said not “on earth,” but “with Thee.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> This glory we also shall enjoy according to our measure, if we be sober. Wherefore
Paul saith, “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.” ( Rom.
viii. 17.) Ten thousand tears then do they merit, who through sluggishness and sleep plot
against themselves when such glory is set before them; and, were there no hell, they would
be more wretched than any, who, when it is in their power to reign and to be glorified with
the Son of God, deprive themselves of so great blessings. Since if it were necessary to be cut
in pieces, if to die ten thousand deaths, if to give up every day ten thousand lives and as
many bodies, ought we not to submit to such things2310 for such glory? But now we do not
even despise money, which hereafter, though unwilling, we shall leave: we do not despise
<note type="footnote">2304 Ben. “and His being.”</note>

<pb n="582"/>
money, which brings about us ten thousand mischiefs, which remains here, which is not
our own. For we are but stewards of that which is not our own, although we receive it from
our fathers. But when there is hell besides, and the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is
not quenched, and the gnashing of teeth, how, tell me, shall we bear these things? How long
will we refuse to see clearly, and spend our all on daily fightings, and contentions, and unprofitable
talk, feeding, cultivating earth, fattening the body and neglecting the soul, making
no account of necessary things, but much care about things superfluous and unprofitable?
And we build splendid tombs, and buy costly houses, and draw about with us herds of all
kinds of servants, and devise different stewards, appointing managers of lands, of houses,
of money, and managers of those managers; but as to our desolate soul, we care nothing for
that. And what will be the limit to this? Is it not one belly that we fill, is it not one body that
we clothe? What is this great bustle of business? Why and wherefore do we cut up and tear
to pieces the one2311 soul, which we have had assigned to us,2312 in attending to the service
of such things, contriving for ourselves a grievous slavery? For he who needs many things
is the slave of many things, although he seem to be their master. Since the lord is the slave
even of his domestics, and brings in another and a heavier mode of service; and in another
way also he is their slave, not daring without them to enter the agora, nor the bath, nor the
field, but they frequently go about in all directions without him. He who seems to be master,
dares not, if his slaves be not present, to go forth from home, and if whilst unattended he
do but put his head out of his house, he thinks that he is laughed at. Perhaps some laugh at
us when we say this, yet on this very account they would be deserving of ten thousand tears.
For to show that this is slavery, I would gladly ask you, wouldest thou wish to need some
one to put the morsel to thy mouth, and to apply the cup to thy lips? Wouldest thou not
deem such a service worthy of tears? What if thou didst require continually supporters to
enable thee to walk, wouldest thou not think thyself pitiable, and in this respect more
wretched than any? So then thou oughtest to be disposed now. For it matters nothing
whether one is so treated by irrational things,2313 or by men.</p>
<p>Why, tell me, do not the Angels differ from us in this respect, that they do not want so
many things as we do? Therefore the less we need, the more we are on our way to them; the
more we need, the more we sink down to this perishable life. And that thou mayest learn
that these things are so, ask those who have grown old which life they deem happiest, that
when they were helplessly2314 mastered, or now when they are masters of these things? We
have mentioned these persons, because those who are intoxicated with youth, do not even
<note type="footnote">2311 one ms. “the precious.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2312 al. “have received.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2313 i.e. receives so much help from them.</note>

<pb n="583"/>
know the excess of their slavery. For what of those in fever, do they call themselves happy
when, thirsting much, they drink much and need more, or when, having recovered their
health, they are free from the desire? Seest thou that in every instance the needing much is
pitiable, and far apart from true wisdom, and an aggravation of slavery and desire? Why
then do we voluntarily increase to ourselves wretchedness? For, tell me, if it were possible
to live uninjured without roof or walls, wouldest thou not prefer this; wherefore then dost
thou increase the signs of thy weakness? Do we not for this call Adam happy, that he needed
nothing, no house, no clothes? “Yes,” saith some one, “but now we are in need of them.”
Why then do we make our need greater? If many persons curtail many of the things actually
needed, (servants, I mean, and houses, and money,) what excuse can we have if we overstep
the need? The more thou puttest about thee, the more slavish dost thou become; for by
whatever proportion thou requirest more, in that proportion thou hast trenched upon thy
freedom. For absolute2315 freedom is, to want nothing at all; the next is, to want little; and
this the Angels and their imitators especially possess. But for men to succeed in this while
tarrying in a mortal body, think how great praise this hath. This also Paul said, when writing
to the Corinthians, “But I spare you,” and, “lest such should have trouble in the flesh.”2316
( 1 Cor. vii. 28.) Riches are called “usables,”2317 that we may “use” them rightly, and not
keep and bury them; for this is not to possess them, but to be possessed by them. Since if
we are going to make this our aim how to multiply them, not that we may employ them
rightly, the order is reversed, and they possess us, not we them. Let us then free ourselves
from this grievous bondage, and at last become free. Why do we devise ten thousand different
chains for ourselves? Is not the bond of nature enough for thee, and the necessity of life,
and the crowd of ten thousand affairs, but dost thou twine also other nets for thyself, and
put them about thy feet? And when wilt thou lay hold on heaven, and be able to stand on2318
that height? For a great thing, a great thing is it, that even having cut asunder all these cords,
thou shouldest be able to lay hold on the city which is above. So many other hindrances are
there; all which that we may conquer, let us keep to the mean estate2319 [and having put
away superfluities, let us keep to what is necessary.] Thus shall we lay hold on eternal life,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xvii. 6</p>
<p>“I have manifested Thy Name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world; Thine
they were, and Thou gavest them Me, and they have kept Thy word.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “‘ Messenger’ of great counsel” ( Isa. ix. 6 , LXX.), the Son of God is called, because
of the other things which He taught, and principally because He announced the Father to
men, as also now He saith, “I have manifested Thy Name unto the men.” For after having
said, “I have finished Thy work,” He next explaineth it in detail, telling what sort of work.
Now the Name indeed was well known. For Esaias said, “Ye shall swear2320 by the true
God.” ( Isa. lxv. 16.) But what I have often told you I tell you now, that though it was known,
yet it was so only to Jews, and not to all of these: but now He speaketh concerning the
Gentiles. Nor doth He declare this merely, but also that they knew Him as the Father. For
it is not the same thing to learn that He is Creator, and that He hath a Son. But He “manifested
His2321 Name” both by words and actions.</p>
<p>“Whom Thou gavest Me out of the world.” As He saith above, “No man cometh unto
Me except it be given him” ( c. vi. 65 ); and, “Except My Father2322 draw him” ( c. vi. 64 );
so here too, “Whom thou gavest Me.” ( c. xiv. 6.) Now He calleth Himself “the Way”; whence
it is clear that He establisheth two things by what is said here, that He is not opposed to the
Father, and that it is the Father’s will to entrust them to the Son.</p>
<p>“Thine they were, and Thou gavest them Me.” Here He desireth to teach2323 that He is
greatly loved by the Father. For that He needed not to receive them, is clear from this, He
made them, He careth for them continually. How then did He receive them? This, as I said
before, showeth His unanimity with the Father. Now if a man choose to enquire into the
matter in a human manner, and as the words are spoken, they2324 will no longer belong to
the Father. For if when the Father had them, the Son had them not, it is evident that when
He gave them to the Son, He withdrew from His dominion over them. And again, there is
a yet more unseemly conclusion; for they will be found to have been imperfect while they
yet were with the Father, but to have become perfect when they came to the Son. But it is
mockery even to speak thus. What then doth He declare by this? 2325 “That it hath seemed
good to the Father also that they should believe on the Son.”</p>

<p>“And they have kept Thy word.”</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “Now they have known that all things whatsoever Thou hast given Me are of
Thee.”</p>
<p>How did they “keep Thy word”? “By believing in Me, and giving no heed to the Jews.
For he that believeth in Him, it saith, ‘hath set to his seal that God is true.’” ( c. iii. 33.) Some
read, “Now I know that all things whatsoever Thou hast given Me are of Thee.” But this
would have no reason; for how would the Son be ignorant of the things of the Father? No
the words are spoken of the disciples. “From the time,” He saith, “that I told them these
things, they have learnt that all that Thou hast given Me is from Thee; nothing is alien,
nothing peculiar to Me, with Thee.”2326 (For whatever is peculiar, puts most things in the
condition of being alien.2327 “They therefore have known that all things, whatsoever I teach,
are Thy doctrines and teachings.” “And whence have they learnt it?” From My words;2328
for so have I taught them. And not only this have I taught them, but also that “I came out
from Thee.” For this He was anxious to prove through all the Gospel.</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “I pray for them.”2329</p>
<p>“What sayest Thou?” “Dost Thou teach the Father, as though He were ignorant? Dost
Thou speak to Him as to a man who knoweth not?” “What then meaneth this distinction?”
Seest thou that the prayer is for nothing else than that they may understand the love which
He hath towards them? For He who not only giveth what He hath of His own, but also calleth
on Another to do the same, showeth greater love. What then is, “I pray for them”? “Not for
all the world,” He saith, but “for them whom Thou hast given Me.” He continually putteth
the “hast given,” that they might learn that this seemeth good to the Father. Then, because
He had said continually, “they are Thine,” and, “Thou gavest them unto Me,” to remove
any evil suspicion, and lest any one should think that His authority was recent, and that He
had but now received them, what saith He?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 10. “All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine; and I am glorified in them.”
Seest thou the equality of honor? For lest on hearing, “Thou hast given them Me,” thou
shouldest deem that they were alienated from the authority of the Father, or before this
from that of the Son, He removed both difficulties by speaking as He did. It was as though
<note type="footnote">2326 παρὰ σοί, i.e. in the Godhead, or with God. However, one Vatican ms. and Catena favor Savile’s
conjecture, παρά σε, “beside Thee,” since the Father is in a peculiar manner His own.</note>
<note type="footnote">2327 τὸ γὰρ ἴδιον ὡς ἐπ̓ ἀλλοτρίῳ τὰ πολλὰ τίθησι, i.e. when one thing is specified as peculiar to a person,
it is implied that other things not specified do not belong to him.</note>
<note type="footnote">2328 Ver. 8. “For I have given unto them the words which Thou gavest Me; and they have received them,
and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that Thou didst send Me.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2329 Ver. 9. “I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which Thou hast given Me; for they are
Thine.”</note>

<pb n="586"/>
He said, “Do not when thou hearest that ‘Thou hast given them to Me,’ deem that they are
alienated from the Father, for what is Mine is His; nor when thou hearest, ‘Thine they were,’
think that they were aliens from Me, for what is His is Mine.” So that the, “Thou hast given,”
is said only for condescension; for what the Father hath is the Son’s, and what the Son hath
is the Father’s. But this cannot even be said of a son after the manner of man, but because
They2330 are upon a greater Equality of honor.2331 For that what belongs to the less, belongs
to the greater also, is clear to every one, but the reverse not so; but here He converteth2332
these terms, and the conversion declares2333 Equality. And in another place, declaring this,
He said, “All things that the Father hath are Mine,” speaking of knowledge. And the “hast
given Me,” and the like expressions, are to show that He did not come as an alien and draw
them to Him, but received them as His own. Then He putteth the cause and the proof, saying,
“And I am glorified in them,” that is, either that “I have power over them,” or, that “they
shall glorify Me, believing in Thee and Me, and shall glorify Us alike.” But if He is not glorified
equally in them, what is the Father’s is no longer His. For no one is glorified in those
over whom he hath no authority. Yet how is He glorified equally? All die for Him equally
as for the Father; they preach Him as they do the Father; and as they say that all things are
done in His Name, so also in the Name of the Son.</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world.”2334</p>
<p>That is, “Although I appear no longer in the flesh, yet by these am I glorified.” But why
doth He say continuously, that, “I am not in the world”; and that, “because I leave them I
commit them to Thee”; and that, “when I was in the world I kept them”? for if one should
take these words in their simple sense, many absurdities will follow. For how could it be
reasonable to say, that He is no longer in the world, and that when He departeth He committeth
them to another? since these are the words of a mere man parting from them forever.
Seest thou how He speaketh for the most part like a man, and in a way adapted to their state
of mind, because they thought that they had a greater degree of safety from His presence?
Wherefore He saith, “While I was with them, I kept them.” ( c. xiv. 28.) Yet He telleth them,
“I come to you”; and, “I am with you till the end.” ( Matt. xxviii. 20.) How then2335 saith
He these words, as if about to be parted from them? He addresseth Himself, as I said before,
<note type="footnote">2330 i.e. the Father and the Son.</note>
<note type="footnote">2331 μείζονός εἰσιν ἰσοτιμίας. If this be the right reading, the sense is, that the Father and the Son are more

<pb n="587"/>
to their thoughts,2336 that they may take breath a little when they hear Him speaking thus,
and delivering them over to the care of the Father. For since, after hearing many exhortations
from Him, they were not persuaded, He then holdeth converse with the Father, manifesting
His affection for them. As though He had said, “Since Thou callest Me to Thyself, place
these in safety; for I come to Thee.” “What sayest Thou? Art Thou not able to keep them?”
“Yea, I am able.” “Wherefore then speakest Thou thus?” “That they may have My joy fulfilled”
2337 ( ver. 13 ); that is, “may not be confounded, as being imperfect.” And by these
words He showed that He had spoken all these things so, to give them rest and joy. For the
saying appears to be contradictory. “Now I am no longer in the world, and these are in the
world.” This was what they were suspecting. For a while therefore He condescendeth to
them, because had He said, “I keep them,” they would not have so well believed; wherefore
He saith, “Holy Father, keep them through Thine own Name”; that is, “by thy help.”</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Thy Name.”</p>
<p>Again He speaketh as a man and as a Prophet, since nowhere doth He appear to have
done anything by the Name of God.</p>
<p>“Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>And in another place He saith, “Of all that Thou gavest Me, I will surely lose nothing.”2338
( c. vi. 39.) Yet not only was he2339 lost, but also many afterwards; how then saith He, “I will
in nowise lose”?2340 “For My part, I will not lose.” So in another place, declaring the matter
was more clearly, He said, “I will in nowise cast out.” ( c. vi. 37.) “Not through fault of Mine,
not because I either instigate or abandon them; but if they start away of themselves, I draw
them not by necessity.”</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “But now I come to thee.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that the discourse is composed rather in a human manner? So that should
any wish from these words to lower the Son, he will lower the Father also. Observe, in proof
of this, how from the beginning He speaketh2341 partly as though informing and explaining
to Him, partly as enjoining. Informing, as when He saith, “I pray not for the world”; enjoining,
as, “I have kept them until now,” “and none of them is lost”; and, “do Thou therefore
now keep them,” He saith. And again, “Thine they were, and Thou hast given them unto

<pb n="588"/>
Me” and “While I was in the world I kept them.” But the solution of all is, that the words
were addressed to their infirmity.</p>
<p>But after having said that “none of them was lost but the son of perdition,” He added,
“that the Scripture might be fulfilled.” Of what Scripture doth He speak? That which foretelleth
many things concerning Him. Not that He perished on that account, in order that
the Scripture might be fulfilled. But we have before spoken at length on this point, that this
is the peculiar manner of Scripture, which puts things which fall out in accordance with it,
as though they were caused by it.2342 And it is needful to enquire exactly into all, both the
manner of the speaker, his argument, and the laws of Scripture, if at least we are minded
not to draw wrong conclusions. For, “Brethren, be not children in your minds.” ( 1 Cor.
xiv. 20.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> This it is necessary to consider well,2343 not only for the understanding the Scriptures,
but also for earnestness in one’s way of life. For so little children do not desire great things,
but are wont to admire those which are worth nothing; they are pleased at seeing chariots,
and horses, and the muleteer, and wheels, all made out of earthenware; but if they see a king
sitting upon a chariot, and a pair of white mules, and great magnificence, they do not even2344
turn their heads. And they deck out as brides dolls made of the same material, but the actual
brides, real and beautiful, they do not even notice; and this is their case in many other matters.
Now this many men also undergo at this time; for when they hear of heavenly things, they
do not even give heed to them, but toward all the things of clay they are as eager as children,
and stupidly admire the wealth which is of earth, and honor the glory and luxury of the
present life. Yet these are just as much toys as those; but the other are the causes of life, and
glory, and repose. But as children deprived of their playthings cry, and do not know how
even to desire the realities, so also are many of those who seem to be men. Wherefore it
saith, “Be not children in your minds.” ( 1 Cor. xiv. 20.) Desirest thou riches, tell me, and
desirest thou not the wealth that lasteth, but childish toys? If thou shouldest see a man admiring
a leaden coin, and stooping to pick it up, thou wouldest pronounce his penury to be
extreme; and dost thou, who collectest more worthless things than this, number thyself
among the rich? How can this consist with reason? We will call him rich who despises all
present things. For no one, no one will choose to laugh at these little things, silver and gold,
and other things of show, unless he have the desire of greater things; just as the man would
not despise the leaden coin,2345 unless he possessed coins of gold. Do thou, therefore, when
thou seest a man running by all worldly things, deem that he doth so from no other motive
<note type="footnote">2342 ὡ ς αἰτιολογίαν τιθεμένης τὰ ἐκ τῆς ἐκβάσεως συμβαίνοντα</note>
<note type="footnote">2343 or, “to read (and understand),” ἀ ναγινώσκειν</note>
<note type="footnote">2344 Ben. “not at all.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2345 al. “the lead.”</note>

<pb n="589"/>
than because he looks to a greater world. So the husbandman despises a few grains of wheat,
when he expects a larger harvest. But if, when the hope is uncertain, we despise things which
are, much more ought we to do so in a case where the expectation is sure. Wherefore I pray
and beseech you not to bring loss on yourselves, nor, keeping hold of mire, rob yourselves
of the treasures which are above, bringing your vessel to port laden with straw and chaff.
Let each say what he will concerning us, let him be angry at our continual admonitions, let
him call us silly, tedious, tiresome, still we will not desist from exhorting you on these matters
continually, and from continually repeating to you that of the Prophet, “‘Break off thy sins
by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor’ ( Dan. iv. 27 ), and bind
them upon thy neck.”2346 Do not act in this way to-day, and desist to-morrow. For even
this body has need of daily food; and so too hath the soul, or rather that much more; and if
it give not,2347 it becomes weaker and more vile. Let us then not neglect it when it is perishing,
choking. Many wounds it receives each day, by being lustful, angry, slothful, reviling, revengeful,
envious. It is therefore necessary to prepare also remedies for it, and no small
remedy is that of almsgiving, which can be placed on every wound. For, “Give alms,” it saith,
“of such things as ye have, and behold all things are clean unto you.” ( Luke xi. 41 .) “Alms,”
not covetousness, for that which proceeds from covetousness endures not, though thou give
to those who need. For almsgiving is that which is free from all injustice, “this” makes all
things clean. This is a thing better even than fasting, or lying on the ground; they may be
more painful and laborious, but this more profitable. It enlightens the soul, makes it sleek,2348
beautiful, and vigorous. Not so doth the fruit of the olive hold up the athletes, as this oil recovers
the combatants of piety. Let us then anoint our hands, that we may lift them up well
against our adversary. He that practiceth showing mercy to him that needeth, will soon
cease from covetousness, he who continues in giving to the poor, will soon cease from anger,
and will never even be high-minded. For as the physician continually tending wounded
persons is easily sobered, beholding human nature in the calamities of others; so we, if we
enter upon the work of aiding the poor, shall easily become truly wise, and shall not admire
riches, nor deem present things any great matter, but despise them all, and soaring aloft to
heaven, shall easily obtain the eternal blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>John xvii. 14</p>
<p>“I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> When having become virtuous we are persecuted by the wicked, or when being
desirous of virtue we are mocked at by them, let us not be distracted or angry. For this is
the natural course of things, and everywhere virtue is wont to engender hatred from wicked
men. For envying those who desire to live properly, and thinking to prepare an excuse for
themselves if they can overthrow the credit of others, they hate them as having pursuits
opposite to their own, and use every means to shame their way of life. But let not us grieve,
for this is a mark of virtue. Wherefore Christ also saith, “If ye were of the world, the world
would love its own.” ( c. xv. 19.) And in another place again, “Woe unto you when all men
shall speak well of you.” ( Luke vi. 26.) Wherefore also He saith here, “I have given them
Thy word, and the world hath hated them.” Again He telleth the reason for which they were
worthy to obtain much care from the Father; “For Thy sake,” He saith, “they have been
hated, and for Thy word’s sake”; so that they would be entitled to all providential care.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou
shouldest keep them from the evil.”</p>
<p>Again He simplifieth2349 His language; again He rendereth it more clear; which is the
act of one showing, by making entreaty for them with exactness, nothing else but this, that
He hath a very tender care for them. Yet He Himself had told them, that the Father would
do all things whatsoever they should ask. How then doth He here pray for them? As I said,
for no other purpose than to show His love.</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.”</p>
<p>How then saith He in another place, “Which Thou gavest Me out of the world; Thine
they were”? ( Ver. 6.) There He speaketh of their nature; here of wicked actions. And He
putteth together a long encomium of them; first, that “they were not of the world”; then,
that “the Father Himself had given them”; and that “they had kept His word;” and that on
this account “they were hated.” And if He saith, “As I am not of the world,” be not troubled;
for the “as” is not here expressive of unvarying exactness. For as, when in the case of Him
and the Father the “as” is used, a great Equality is signified, because of the Relationship in
Nature; so when it is used of us and Him, the interval is great, because of the great and infinite
interval between the respective natures. For if He “did no sin, neither was guile found
in His mouth” ( 1 Pet. ii. 22 ), how could the Apostles be reckoned equal to Him? What is
<note type="footnote">2349 σαφηνίζει</note>

<pb n="591"/>
it then that He saith, “They are not of the world”? “They look to another world, they have
nothing common with earth, but are become citizens of heaven.” And by these words He
showeth His love, when He commendeth them to the Father, and committeth them to Him
who begat Him. When He saith, “Keep them,” He doth not speak merely of delivering them
from dangers, but also with regard to their continuance in the faith. Wherefore He addeth,</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “Sanctify them through Thy truth.” “Make them holy by the gift of the Spirit,
and of right doctrines.” As when He saith, “Ye are clean through the word which I spake
unto you” ( c. xv. 3 ), so now He saith the same thing, “Instruct them, teach them the truth.”
“And yet He saith that the Spirit doth this. How then doth He now ask it from the Father?”
That thou mayest again learn their equality of Honor. For right doctrines asserted concerning
God sanctify the soul. And if He saith that they are sanctified by the word, marvel not. And
to show that He speaketh of doctrines, He addeth,</p>
<p>“Thy word is truth.”</p>
<p>That is, “there is no falsehood in it, and all that is said in it must needs come to pass”;
and again, it signifieth nothing typical or bodily. As also Paul saith concerning the Church,
that He hath sanctified it by the Word. For the Word of God is wont also to cleanse. ( Eph.
v. 26.) Moreover, the, “sanctify them,” seems to me to signify something else, such as this,
“Set them apart for the Word and for preaching.” And this is made plain from what follows.
For, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the
world.”</p>
<p>As Paul also saith, “Having put in us the word of reconciliation.” ( 2 Cor. v. 19.) For the
same end for which Christ came, for the same did these take possession of the world. In this
place again the “as” is not put to signify resemblance in the case of Himself and the Apostles;
for how was it possible for men to be sent otherwise? But it was His custom to speak of the
future as having come to pass. 2350</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified in the
truth.”</p>
<p>What is, “I sanctify Myself”? “I offer to Thee a sacrifice.” Now all sacrifices are called
“holy,” and those are specially called “holy things,” which are laid up for God. For whereas
of old in type the sanctification was by the sheep, but now it is not2351 in type, but by the
truth itself, He therefore saith, “That they may be sanctified in Thy truth.” “For I both dedicate
them to Thee, and make them an offering”; this He saith, either because their Head
was being made so,2352 or because they also were sacrificed; for, “Present,” it saith, “your
<note type="footnote">2350 i.e. the words refer to the mission of the Ap. on the day of Pentecost.</note>
<note type="footnote">2351 al. “is no longer.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2352 διὰ τὸ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦτο γίνεσθαι, al. γίνεται</note>

<pb n="592"/>
bodies a living sacrifice, holy” ( Rom. xii. 1 ); and, “We were counted as sheep for the
slaughter.” ( Ps. xliv. 22.) And He maketh them; without death, a sacrifice and offering; for
that He alluded to His own sacrifice, when He said, “I sanctify,” is clear from what follows.</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who shall believe.”2353</p>
<p><del>2.</del> For since He was dying for them, and said, that “For their sakes I sanctify Myself,”
lest any one should think that He did this for the Apostles only, He added, “Neither pray I
for these only, but for them also who believe on Me through their word.” By this again He
revived their souls, showing that the disciples should be many. For because He made common
what they possessed peculiarly, He comforteth them by showing that they were being made
the cause of the salvation of others.</p>
<p>After having thus spoken concerning their salvation, and their being sanctified by faith
and the Sacrifice, He afterwards speaketh of concord, and finally closeth his discourse with
this, having begun with it and ended2354 in it. For at the beginning He saith, “A new commandment
I give unto you” ( c. xiii. 34 ); and here,</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me and I in Thee.”</p>
<p>Here again the “as” doth not denote exact similarity in their case, (for it was not possible
for them in so great a degree,) but only as far as was possible for men. Just as when He saith
“Be ye merciful, as your Father.” ( Luke vi. 36.)</p>
<p>But what is, “In Us”?2355 In the faith which is on Us. Because nothing so offends all
men as divisions, He provideth that they should be one. “What then,” saith some one, “did
He effect this?” Certainly He effected it. For all who believe through the Apostles are one,
though some from among them were torn away. Nor did this escape His knowledge, He
even foretold it, and showed that it proceeded from men’s slack-mindedness.</p>
<p>“That the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.”</p>
<p>As He said in the beginning, “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye
love one another.” And how should they hence believe? “Because,” He saith, “Thou art a
God of peace.” If therefore they observe the same as those of whom they have learnt, their
hearers shall know the teacher by the disciples, but if they quarrel, men shall deny that they
are the disciples of a God of peace, and will not allow that I, not being peaceable, have been
sent from Thee. Seest thou how, unto the end, He proveth His unanimity with the Father?</p>

<p>That by miracles, that by doctrines,2357 and, that they should be of one soul; for this is
glory, that they should be one, and greater even than miracles. As men2358 admire God because
there is no strife or discord in That Nature, and this is His greatest glory, “so too let
these,” He saith, “from this cause become glorious.” “And how,” saith some one, “doth He
ask the Father to give this to them, when He saith that He Himself giveth it?” Whether His
discourse be concerning miracles, or unanimity, or peace, He is seen Himself to have given
these things to them; whence it is clear that the petition is made for the sake of their comfort.</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “I in them, and Thou in Me.”</p>
<p>“How gave He the glory?” By being in them, and having the Father with Him, so as to
weld them2359 together. But in another place He speaketh not so; He saith not that the
Father cometh by Him, but, “that He and the Father come, and take up their abode with
him,”2360 “there” removing the suspicion of Sabellius, “here” that of Arius.2361</p>
<p>“That they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that Thou hast
sent Me.” ( c. xiv. 23.)</p>
<p>He saith these latter words immediately after the other, to show that peace hath more
power to attract men than a miracle; for as it is the nature of strife2362 to separate, so it is
that of agreement to weld together.</p>
<p>“And I have2363 loved them as Thou hast loved Me.”</p>
<p>Here again the “as” means, as far as it is possible for a man to be loved; and the sure
proof of His love is His giving Himself for them. After having told them that they shall be
in safety, that they shall not be overturned, that they shall be holy, that many shall believe
through them, that they shall enjoy great glory, that not He alone loved them, but the
Father also; He next telleth them of what shall be after their sojourning here, 2364 concerning
the prizes and crowns laid up for them.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “Father,” He saith, “I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me
where I am.”</p>

didst Thou say to them, ‘Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones’? ( Matt. xix. 28.) How didst Thou
promise other things more and greater?” Seest thou that He saith all2365 in the way of condescension?
since how would He have said, “Thou shalt follow afterwards”? ( c. xiii. 36.)
But He speaketh thus with a view to a fuller conviction and demonstration of His love.</p>
<p>“That they may behold My glory which Thou hast given Me.”</p>
<p>This again is a sign of His being of one mind with the Father, of a higher character than
those former, for He saith, “Before2366 the foundation of the world,” yet hath it also a certain
condescension; for, “Thou hast given Me,” He saith. Now if this be not the case, I would
gladly ask the gainsayers a question. He that giveth, giveth to one subsisting;2367 did the
Father then, having first begotten the Son, afterwards give Him glory, having before allowed
Him to be without glory? And how could this be reasonable? Seest that the “He gave,” is,
“He begot”?</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But why said He not, “That they may share My glory,” instead of, “That they may
be hold My glory”? Here He implieth, that all that rest is, the looking on the Son of God.
This certainly it is which causes them to be glorified; as Paul saith, “With open face mirroring
the glory of the Lord.” ( 2 Cor. iii. 18.) For as they who look on the sunbeams, and enjoy a
very clear atmosphere, draw their enjoyment from their sight, so then also, and in much
greater degree, this will cause us pleasure.2368 At the same time also He showeth, that what
they should behold was not the body then seen, but some awful Substance.</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee.”2369</p>
<p>What meaneth this? What connection hath it? He here showeth that no man knoweth
God, save those only who have come to know the Son. And what He saith is of this kind: “I
wished all to be so,2370 yet they have not known Thee, although they had no complaint
against Thee.” For this is the meaning of, “O righteous Father.” And here He seemeth to
me to speak these words, as vexed that they would not know One so just and good. For since
the Jews had said that they knew God, but that He knew Him not, at this He aimeth, saying,
“For Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world”; thus putting together a defense
against the accusations of the Jews. For how could He who had received glory, who was
loved before the foundation of the world, who desired to have them as witnesses of that
glory, how could He be opposed to the Father? “This then is not true which the Jews say,

that they know Thee, and that I know Thee not; on the contrary, I know Thee, and they
have not known Thee.”</p>
<p>“And these have known that Thou hast sent Me.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that He alludeth to those, who said that He was not from God, and all is finally
summed up to meet this argument?</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “And I have declared unto them Thy Name, and will declare it.”</p>
<p>“Yet thou sayest that perfect knowledge is from the Spirit.” “But the things of the Spirit
are Mine.”</p>
<p>“That the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may remain2371 in them, and I in them.”</p>
<p>“For if they learn who Thou art, then they shall know that I am not separated from Thee,
but one of the greatly beloved, and a true Son, and closely knit to Thee. And those who are
rightly persuaded of this, will keep both the faith which is on Me and perfect love; and while
they love as they ought, I remain in them.” Seest thou how He hath arrived2372 at a good
end, finishing off the discourse with love, the mother of all blessings?</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us then believe and love God, that it may not be said of us, “They profess that
they know God, but in their works they deny Him.” ( Tit. i. 16.) And again, “He hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel.” ( 1 Tim. v. 8.) For when he2373 helps his domestics
and kinsmen and strangers, while thou dost not even succor those who are related to thee
by family, what will henceforth be thy excuse, when God is blasphemed and insulted by
reason of thee? Consider what opportunities of doing good God hath given to us. “Have
mercy on one,” He saith, “as a kinsman, on another as a friend, on another as a neighbor,
on another as a citizen, on another as a man.” And if none of these things hold thee, but
thou breakest through all bonds, hear from Paul, that thou art “worse than an infidel”; for
he having heard nothing of almsgiving, or of heavenly things, hath overshot thee in love for
man; but thou who art bidden to love thy very enemies, lookest upon thy friends as enemies,
and art more careful of thy money than of their bodies. Yet the money by being spent will
sustain no injury, but thy brother if neglected will perish. What madness then to be careful
of money, and careless about one’s kindred? Whence hath this craving for riches burst in
upon us?2374 Whence this inhumanity and cruelty? For if any one could, as though seated
on the highest bench of a theater, look down upon all the world,—or rather, if you will, let
us for the present take in hand a single city,—if then a man seated on an elevated spot could
take in at a glance all the doings of the men there, consider what folly he would condemn,
what tears he would weep, what laughter he would laugh, with what hatred he would hate;

<pb n="596"/>
for we commit such actions as deserve both laughter, and the charge of folly, and tears, and
hatred. One man keeps dogs to catch2375 brute animals, himself sinking into brutality; another
keeps oxen and asses to transport stones, but neglects men wasting with hunger; and
spends gold without limit to make men of stone, but neglects real men, who are becoming
like stones through their evil state. Another, collecting with great pains golden quarries,2376
puts them about his walls, but when he beholds the naked bellies of the poor, is not
moved.2377 Some again contrive garments over their very garments, while their brother
hath not even wherewithal to cover his naked body. Again, one hath swallowed up another
in the law-courts; another hath spent his money on women and parasites, another on stageplayers
and theatrical bands,2378 another on splendid edifices, on purchases of fields and
houses. Again, one man is counting interest, another interest of interest; another is putting
together2379 bands full of many deaths, and doth not enjoy rest even at night, lying awake
for others’ harm. Then, when it is day, they run, one to his unjust gain, another to his wanton
expense, others to public robbery.2380 And great is the earnestness about things superfluous
and forbidden, but of things necessary no account is taken; and they who decide questions
of law have indeed the name of jurymen, but are really2381 thieves and murderers. And if
one should enquire into law suits and wills, he would find there again ten thousand mischiefs,
frauds, robberies, plots, and about these things is all time spent; but for spiritual things there
is no care, and they all inconvenience the Church, for the sake of seeing only. But this is not
what is required; we need works, and a pure mind.2382 But if thou spendest all the day in
grasping after riches, and then coming in sayest a few words, thou hast not only not propitiated
God, but hast even angered Him more. Wouldest thou conciliate thy Lord, exhibit
works, make thyself acquainted with the mass of woes, look upon the naked, the hungry,
the wronged; He hath cut out for thee ten thousand ways of showing love for men. Let us
not then deceive ourselves by living aimlessly and to no purpose, nor presume, because we
now are in health; but bearing in mind, that often when we have fallen into sickness, and
have reached the extreme of debility, we have been dead with fear and the looking for things
to come, let us expect to fall again into the same state, let us get again the same fear, and let
us become better men; since what is done now deserves infinite condemnation. For those

in the courts of justice are like lions and dogs; those in the public places like foxes; and those
who lead a life of leisure, even they do not use their leisure as they ought, spending all their
time on theaters and the mischiefs arising from them. And there is no one to reprove what
is being done; but there are many who envy, and are vexed that they are not in the like
condition,2383 so that these in their turn are punished, though not actually doing wicked
things. For they “not only do these things, but also have pleasure in them that do them.”
Because what belongs to their will is alike2384 corrupt; whence it is plain, that the intention
also will be punished. These things I say each day, and I will not cease to say them. For if
any listen, it is gain; but if none give heed, ye shall then hear these things, when it will avail
you nothing, and ye shall blame yourselves, and we shall be flee from fault. But may it never
come to pass that we should only have this excuse, but that you may be our boast before the
judgment-seat of Christ, that together we may enjoy the blessings, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXIII.</head>
<p>John xviii. 1</p>
<p>“When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron,
where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> An awful thing is death, and very full of terror, but not to those who have learnt the
true wisdom which is above. For he that knows nothing certain concerning things to come,
but deems it2385 to be a certain dissolution and end of life, with reason shudders and is
afraid, as though he were passing into non-existence. But we who, by the grace of God, have
learnt the hidden and secret things of His wisdom, and deem the action to be a departure
to another place, should have no reason to tremble, but rather to rejoice and be glad, that
leaving this perishable life we go to one far better and brighter, and which hath no end.
Which Christ teaching by His actions, goeth to His Passion, not by constraint and necessity,
but willingly. “These things,” it saith, “Jesus spake, and departed ‘beyond the brook Cedron,
where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.’”</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “Judas also, which betrayed Him, knew the place; for Jesus ofttimes resorted
thither with His disciples.”</p>
<p>He journeyeth at midnight, and crosseth a river, and hasteth to come to a place known
to the traitor, lessening the labor to those who plotted against Him, and freeing them from
all trouble; and showeth to the disciples that He came willingly to the action, (a thing which
was most of all sufficient to comfort them,) and placeth Himself in the garden as in a prison.</p>
<p>“These things spake Jesus unto them.” “What sayest thou?2386 Surely He was speaking
with the Father, surely He was praying. Why then dost thou not say that, ‘having ceased
from the prayer,’ He came there?” Because it was not prayer, but a speech made on account
of the disciples. “And the disciples entered into the garden.” He had so freed them from fear
that they no longer resisted, but entered with Him into the garden. But how came Judas
there, or whence had he gained his information when he came? It is evident from this circumstance,
that Jesus generally2387 passed the night out of doors.2388 For had He been in
the habit of spending it at home, Judas would not have come to the desert, but to the house,
expecting there to find Him asleep. And lest, hearing of a “garden,” thou shouldest think
that Jesus hid Himself, it addeth, that “Judas knew the place”; and not simply so,2389 but
<note type="footnote">2385 i.e. death, lit. “the action.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2386 addressed to St. John.</note>
<note type="footnote">2387 τὰ πολλὰ</note>
<note type="footnote">2388 ἔ ξω</note>
<note type="footnote">2389 or, “not once, but often,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="599"/>
that He “often resorted thither with His disciples.” For ofttimes He was with them apart,
conversing on necessary matters, and such as it was not permitted to others to hear. And
He did this especially in mountains and gardens, seeking a place free from disturbance, that
their attention might not be distracted from listening.</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the Chief Priests
and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.”</p>
<p>And these men had often at other times sent to seize Him, but had not been able; whence
it is plain, that at this time He voluntarily surrendered Himself. And how did they persuade
the band? They were soldiers,2390 who had made it their practice to do anything for money.</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon Him, went forth,
and said, Whom seek ye?”</p>
<p>That is, He did not wait to learn this from their coming, but spake and acted without
confusion, as knowing all these things. “But why come they with weapons, when about to
seize Him?” They feared His followers, and for this reason they came upon Him late at night.
“And He went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?”</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth.”2391</p>
<p>Seest thou His invincible power, how being in the midst of them He disabled their eyes?
for that the darkness was not the cause of their not knowing Him, the Evangelist hath shown,
by saying, that they had torches also. And even had there been no torches, they ought at
least to have known Him by His voice; or if they did not know it, how could Judas be ignorant,
who had been so continually with Him? for he too stood with them, and knew Him no more
than they, but with them fell backward. And Jesus did this to show, that not only they could
not seize Him, but could not even see Him when in the midst, unless He gave permission.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “He saith again, Whom seek ye?”2392 What madness! His word threw them
backward, yet not even so did they turn, when they had learnt that His power was so great,
but again set themselves to the same attempt. When therefore He had fulfilled all that was
His, then He gave Himself up.</p>
<p>Ver. 8. “He answered, I told you that I Am.” ( Ver. 5. “And Judas also which betrayed
Him stood with them.”)</p>
<p>See the forbearance2393 of the Evangelist, how he doth not insult over the traitor, but
relates what took place, only desiring to prove one thing, that the whole took place with His
<note type="footnote">2390 στρατιῶται, mercenaries.</note>
<note type="footnote">2391 Ver. 5, 6. “They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I Am. And Judas also which

the ground.” N.T.</note>

own consent. Then, lest any one should say that He Himself brought them to this, by having
placed Himself into their hands, and revealed Himself to them; after having shown to them
all things which should have been sufficient to repulse them, when they persevered in their
wickedness, and had no excuse, He put Himself in their hands, saying,</p>
<p>“If therefore ye seek Me, let these go their way.”</p>
<p>Manifesting until the last hour His lovingkindness towards them. “If,” He saith, “ye
want Me, have nothing to do with these, for, behold, I give Myself up.”</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “That the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of those which Thou gavest
Me have I lost none.”</p>
<p>By “loss”2394 He doth not here mean that which is of death, but that which is eternal;
though the Evangelist in the present case includes the former also. And one might wonder
why they did not seize them with Him, and cut them to pieces, especially when Peter had
exasperated them by what he did to the servant. Who then restrained them? No other than
that Power which cast them backward. And so the Evangelist, to show that it did not come
to pass through their intention, but by the power and decree of Him whom they had seized,
has added, “That the saying might be fulfilled which He spake,” that “not one, U+0026c.” ( c. xvii.
12.)</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Peter, therefore, taking courage from His voice, and from what had already happened,
arms himself against the assailants,2395 “And how,” saith some one, “doth he who was bidden
not to have a scrip, not to have two coats, possess a sword?” Methinks he had prepared it
long before, as fearing this very thing which came to pass. But if thou sayest, “How doth he,
who was forbidden even to strike a blow with the hand, become a manslayer?” He certainly
had been commanded not to defend himself, but here he did not defend himself, but his
Master. And besides, they were not as yet perfect or complete. But if thou desirest to see
Peter endued with heavenly wisdom, thou shalt after this behold him wounded, and bearing
it meekly, suffering ten thousand dreadful things, and not moved to anger. But Jesus here
also worketh a miracle, both showing that we ought to do good to those who do evil to us,
and revealing His own power. He therefore restored the servant’s ear, and said to Peter, that
“All they that take the sword shall perish by the sword” ( Matt. xxvi. 52 ); and as He did in
the case of the basin, when He relaxed his vehemence2396 by a threat, so also here. The
Evangelist adds the name of the servant, because the thing done was very great, not only
because He healed him, but because He healed one who had come against Him, and who
shortly after would buffet Him, and because He stayed the war which was like to have been
<note type="footnote">2394 more exactly, “perdition.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2395 Ver. 10. “Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off
his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.”</note>

<pb n="601"/>
kindled from this circumstance against the disciples. For this cause the Evangelist hath put
the name, so that the men of that time might search and enquire diligently whether these
things had really come to pass. And not without a cause doth he mention the “right ear,”
but as I think desiring to show the impetuosity of the Apostle, that he almost aimed at the
head itself. Yet Jesus not only restraineth him by a threat, but also calmeth him by other
words, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it?”2397</p>
<p>Showing, that what was done proceeded not from their power, but from His consent,
and declaring that He was not one opposed to God but obedient to the Father even unto
death.</p>
<p>Ver. 12, 13. “Then Jesus was taken; and they bound Him, and led Him away to Annas.”
2398</p>
<p>Why to Annas? In their pleasure they made a show of2399 what had been done, as though
forsooth they had set up a trophy.</p>
<p>“And he was father-in-law to Caiaphas.”</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient
that one man should die for the people.”</p>
<p>Why doth the Evangelist again remind us of his prophecy? To show that these things
were done for our salvation. And such is the exceeding force of truth, that even enemies
proclaimed these things beforehand. For lest the listener, hearing of bonds, should be confounded,
he reminds him of that prophecy, that the death of Jesus was the salvation of the
world.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.”2400</p>
<p>Who is that other disciple? It is the writer himself. “And wherefore doth he not name
himself? When he lay on the bosom of Jesus, he with reason concealed his name; but now
why doth he this?” For the same reason, for here too he mentions a great good deed, that
when all had started away,2401 he followed. Therefore he conceals himself, and puts Peter

Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door,
and brought in Peter.” N.T.</note>

<pb n="602"/>
before him. He was obliged to mention himself, that thou mightest understand that he
narrates more exactly than the rest what took place in the hall, as having been himself
within. But observe how he detracts from his own praise; for, lest any one should ask, “How,
when all had retreated, did this man enter in farther than Simon?” he saith, that he “was
known to the high priest.” So that no one should wonder that he followed, or cry him up
for his manliness. But the wonder was that matter of Peter, that being in such fear, he came
even as far as the hall, when the others had retreated. His coming thither was caused by love,
his not entering within by distress and fear. For the Evangelist hath recorded these things,
to clear a way for excusing his denial; with regard to himself, he doth not set it down as any
great matter that he was known to the high priest, but since he had said that he alone with
Jesus went in, lest thou shouldest suppose that the action proceeded from any exalted feelings,
he puts also the cause. And that Peter would have also entered had he been permitted, he
shows by the sequel; for when he went out, and bade the damsel who kept the door bring
in Peter, he straightway came in. But why did he not bring him in himself? He clung to
Christ, and followed Him; on this account he bade2402 the woman bring him in. What then
saith the woman?</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? And he saith, I am not.”2403</p>
<p>What sayest thou, Peter? Didst thou not declare but now, “If need be that I lay down
my life for Thee, I will lay it down”? What hath happened then, that thou canst not even
endure the questioning of a door-keeper? Is it a soldier who questions thee? Is it one of those
who seized Him? No, it is a mean and abject door-keeper, nor is the questioning of a rough
kind.2404 She saith not, “Art thou a disciple of that cheat and corrupter,” but, “of that man,”
which was the expression rather of one pitying and relenting.2405 But Peter could not bear
any of these words. The, “Art not thou also,” is said on this account, that John was within.
So mildly did the woman speak. But he perceived none of this, nor took it into his mind,
neither the first time, nor the second, nor the third, but when the cock crew; nor did this
even bring him to his senses, till Jesus gave him the bitter look. And he stood warming
himself2406 with the servants of the high priest, but Christ was kept bound within. This we
say not as accusing Peter, but showing the truth of what had been said by Christ.</p>

<p><del>3.</del> O the wickedness! Though he had continually heard Him speaking in the temple
and teaching openly, he now desires to be informed. For since they had no charge to bring,
they enquired concerning His disciples, perhaps where they were, and why He had collected
them, and with what intention, and on what terms. And this he said, as desiring to prove
Him to be a seditious person and an innovator, since no one gave heed to Him, except them
alone, as though His were some factory of wickedness. What then saith Christ? To overthrow
this, He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “I spake openly to the world, (not to the disciples privately,) I taught openly in
the temple.”2407</p>
<p>“What then, said He nothing in secret?” He did, but not, as they thought, from fear, and
to make conspiracies, but if at any time His sayings were too high for the hearing of the
many.</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “Why askest thou Me? Ask them which heard Me.”2408</p>
<p>These are not the words of one speaking arrogantly, but of one confiding in the truth
of what He had said. What therefore He said at the beginning, “If I bear witness of Myself,
My witness is not true” ( c. v. 31 ), this He now implieth, desiring to render His testimony
abundantly credible. For when Annas mentioned the disciples,2409 what saith He? “Dost
thou ask Me concerning Mine? Ask Mine enemies, ask those who have plotted against Me,
who have bound Me; let them speak.” This is an unquestionable proof of truth, when one
calls his enemies to be witnesses to what he saith. What then doth the high priest? When it
would have been right thus to have made the enquiry, that person did not so.</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by smote Him
with the palm of his hand.”2410</p>
<p>What could be more audacious than this? Shudder, O heaven, be astounded, O earth,
at the long-suffering of the Lord, and the senselessness of the servants! Yet what was it that
He said? He said not, “Why askest thou Me,” as if refusing to speak, but wishing to remove
every pretext for senseless behavior; and being upon this buffeted, though He was able to
shake, to annihilate, or to remove all things, He doth not any one of these, but speaketh
words able to relax any brutality.</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “And He saith, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil.”2411</p>
<note type="footnote">2407 “Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple,

<p>That is, “If thou canst lay hold on My words, declare it; but if thou canst not, why strikest
thou Me?” Seest thou that the judgment-hall is full of tumult, and trouble, and passion, and
confusion? The high priest asked deceitfully and treacherously, Christ answered in a
straightforward manner, and as was meet. What then was next to be done? Either to refute,
or to accept what He said. This however is not done, but a servant buffets Him. So far was
this from being a court of justice, and the proceedings those of a conspiracy, and a deed of
tyranny. Then not having even so made any farther discovery, they send Him bound to
Caiaphas.2412</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.”</p>
<p>Wonderful, by what a lethargy2413 that hot and furious one was possessed, when Jesus
was being led away! After such things as had taken place, he doth not move, but still warms
himself, that thou mayest learn how great is the weakness of our nature if God abandoneth.
And, being questioned, he denies again.2414</p>
<p>Ver. 26. Then saith “the kinsman2415 of him whose ear Peter cut off, (grieving at what
had taken place,) Did I not see thee in the garden?”2416</p>
<p>But neither did the garden bring him to remember what had taken place,2417 nor the
great affection which Jesus there had shown by those words, but all these from pressure of
anxiety he banished from his mind. But why have the Evangelists with one accord written
concerning him? Not as accusing the disciple, but as desiring to teach us, how great an evil
it is not to commit all to God, but to trust to one’s self. But do thou admire the tender care
of his Master, who, though a prisoner and bound, took great forethought for His disciple,
raising Peter up, when he was down, by His look, and launching him into a sea of tears.2418</p>
<p>“They lead Him therefore from Caiaphas to Pilate.”2419</p>
<p>This was done, in order that the number of His judges might show, even against their
will, how fully tested was His truth. “And it was early.” Before cock crow He was brought

to Caiaphas, early in the morning to Pilate; whence the Evangelist shows, that being questioned
by Caiaphas during an entire half of the night, He was in nothing proved guilty;
wherefore Caiaphas sent Him on to Pilate. But leaving these things for the others to relate,
John speaks of what follows next. And observe the ridiculous conduct of the Jews. They who
had seized the innocent, and taken up arms, do not enter into the hall of judgment, “lest
they should be polluted.” And tell me, what kind of pollution was it to set foot in a judgmenthall,
where wrong-doers suffer justice? They who paid tithes of mint and anise, did not think
they were polluted when bent on killing unjustly, but thought that they polluted themselves
by even treading in a court of justice. “And why did they not kill Him, instead of bringing
Him to Pilate?” In the first place, the greater part of their rule and authority had been cut
away, when their affairs were placed under the power of the Romans; and besides, they
feared lest they should afterwards be accused and punished by Him. “But what is, ‘That they
might eat the Passover?’ For He had done this on the first day of unleavened bread.” Either
he calls the whole feast “the Passover,” or means, that they were then keeping the Passover,
while He delivered it to His followers one day sooner, reserving His own Sacrifice for2420
the Preparation-day, when also of old the Passover was celebrated. But they, though they
had taken up arms, which was unlawful, and were shedding blood, are scrupulous about
the place, and bring forth Pilate to them.</p>
<p>Ver. 29. “And having gone out, he said, What accusation bring ye against this man?”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Seest thou that he was free from2421 fondness for rule and from malice? For seeing
Jesus bound, and led by so many persons, he did not think that they had unquestionable
proof of their accusation, but questions them, thinking it a strange thing that they should
take for themselves the judgment, and then commit the punishment without any judgment
to him. What then say they?</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.”</p>
<p>O madness! for why do ye not mention His evil deeds, instead of concealing them? Why
do ye not prove the evil? Seest thou that they everywhere avoid a direct accusation, and that
they can say nothing? That Annas questioned Him about His doctrine, and having heard
Him, sent Him to Caiaphas; and he having in his turn questioned Him, and discovered,
nothing, sent Him to Pilate. Pilate saith, “What accusation bring ye against this man?” Nor
here have they anything to say, but again employ certain2422 conjectures. At which Pilate
being perplexed saith,</p>
<note type="footnote">2420 or, “waiting for His,” U+0026c., “on.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2421 al. “from their.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2422 al. “but in certain.”</note>

<pb n="606"/>
<p>Ver. 31, 32. “Take ye him and judge him according to your law. They therefore said, It
is not lawful for us to put any man to death.” But this they said, “that the saying of the Lord
might be fulfilled, which He spake, signifying by what death He should die.”</p>
<p>“And how did the expression, ‘It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,’ declare
this?” Either the Evangelist means that He was about to be slain not by the Jews only, but
by2423 the Gentiles also, or that it was not lawful for them to crucify. But if they say, “It is
not lawful for us to put any man to death,” they say it with reference to that season. For that
they did slay men, and that they slew them in a different way, Stephen shows, being stoned.
But they desired to crucify Him, that they might make a display of the manner of His death.
Pilate, wishing to be freed from trouble, doth not dismiss Him for a long trial, but,</p>
<p>Ver. 33, 34. “Having entered in, he asked Jesus, and said,2424 Art thou the King of the
Jews? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of Me?”</p>
<p>Wherefore did Christ ask this? Because He desired to expose the evil intentions of the
Jews. Pilate had heard this saying from many, and, since the accusers had nothing to say,
in order that the enquiry might not be a long one, he desires to bring forward that which
was continually reported. But when he said to them, “Judge him according to your law,”
wishing to show that His offense was not a Jewish one, they replied, “It is not lawful for us.”
“He hath not sinned against our law, but the indictment is general.”2425 Pilate then, having
perceived this, saith, as being (himself) likely to be endangered, “Art thou the King of the
Jews?” Then Jesus, not from ignorance, but from a desire that the Jews should be accused
even by him, asked him, saying, “Did others tell it thee?”2426 On this point then declaring
himself, Pilate replied,</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto
me; what hast thou done?”</p>
<p>Here desiring to clear himself of the matter. Then because he had said, “Art thou the
King?” Jesus reproving him answereth, “This thou hast heard from the Jews. Why dost thou
not make accurate enquiry? They have said that I am a malefactor; ask them what evil I have
done. But this thou doest not, but art simply framing charges against Me.” “Jesus answered
him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself,” or from others? Pilate then cannot at once say that
he had heard it, but simply goes along with2427 the people, saying, “They have delivered
thee unto me.” “I must needs therefore ask thee what thou hast done.” What then saith
Christ?</p>
<note type="footnote">2423 Ben. “not for,” U+0026c., “but for.”</note>

<p>Ver. 36. “My Kingdom is not of this world.”</p>
<p>He leadeth upwards Pilate who was not a very wicked man, nor after their fashion, and
desireth to show that He is not a mere man, but God and the Son of God. And what saith
He?</p>
<p>“If My Kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews.”2428</p>
<p>He undoeth that which Pilate for a while had feared, namely, the suspicion of seizing
kingly power, “Is then His kingdom not of this world also?”2429 Certainly it is. “How then
saith He it ‘is not’?” Not because He doth not rule here, but because He hath his empire
from above, and because it is not human, but far greater than this and more splendid. “If
then it be greater, how was He made captive by the other?” By consenting, and giving
Himself up. But He doth not at present reveal2430 this, but what saith He? “If I had been of
this world, ‘My servants would fight, that I should not be delivered.’” Here He showeth the
weakness of kingship among us, that its strength lies in servants; but that which is above is
sufficient for itself, needing nothing. From this the heretics taking occasion say, that He is
different from the Creator. What then, when it saith, “He came to His own”? ( c. i. 11 .)
What, when Himself saith, “They are not of this world, as I am not of this world”? ( c. xvii.
14.) So also He saith that His kingdom is not from hence, not depriving the world of His
providence and superintendence, but showing, as I said, that His power was not human or
perishable. What then said Pilate?</p>
<p>Ver. 37. “Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King. To this
end was I born.”</p>
<p>If then He was born a king, all His other attributes are by Generation, and He hath
nothing which He received in addition. So that when thou hearest that, “As the Father hath
life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son also to have life” ( c. v. 26 ), deem of nothing
else but His generation, and so of the rest.</p>
<p>“And for this cause came I,2431 that I should bear witness unto the truth.”</p>
<p>That is, “that I should speak this very thing, and teach it, and persuade all men.”</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But do thou, O man, when thou hearest these things, and seest thy Lord bound and
led about, deem present things to be nought. For how can it be otherwise than strange, if
Christ bore such things for thy sake, and thou often canst not endure even words? He is spit
upon, and dost thou deck thyself with garments and rings, and, if thou gain not good report
from all, think life unbearable? He is insulted, beareth mockings, and scornful blows upon

the cheek; and dost thou wish everywhere to be honored, and bearest thou not the reproaching
of Christ? Hearest thou not Paul saying, “Be ye imitators2432 of me, even as I also am
of Christ”? ( 1 Cor. xi. 1.) When therefore any one makes a jest of thee, remember thy Lord,
that in mockery they bowed the knee before Him, and worried2433 Him both by words and
deeds, and treated Him with much irony; but He not only did not defend Himself, but even
repaid them with the contraries, with mildness and gentleness. Him now let us emulate; so
shall we be enabled even to be delivered from all insult. For it is not the insulter that gives
effect to acts of insult, and makes them biting, but he who is little of soul, and is pained by
them. If thou art not pained, thou hast not been insulted; for the suffering from injuries
depends not on those who inflict, but on those who undergo them. Why dost thou grieve
at all? If a man hath insulted thee unjustly, in this case surely thou oughtest not to grieve at
all, but to pity him; if justly, much more oughtest thou to keep quiet. For should any one
address thee, a poor man, as though thou wert rich, the praise contained in his words is
nothing to thee, but his encomium is rather mockery; and so if one insulting thee utter
things that are untrue, the reproach is nothing to thee either. But if conscience takes hold
of what hath been said, be not grieved at the words, but make correction in deeds. This I
say with regard to what really are insults. For if one reproach thee with poverty or low birth,
laugh at him.2434 These things are a reproach not to the hearer, but to the speaker, as not
knowing true wisdom. “But,” saith some one, “when these things are said in the presence
of many who are ignorant of the truth, the wound becomes unbearable.” Nay, it is most
bearable, when you have an audience present of witnesses praising and applauding you,
scoffing at and making a jest of him. For not he that defends himself, but he that saith
nothing, is applauded by sensible persons. And if none of those present be a sensible person,
then laugh at him most of all, and delight thyself in the audience of heaven. For there all
will praise and applaud and welcome thee. For one Angel is as good as all the world. But
why speak I of Angels, when the Lord Himself proclaimeth2435 thee? Let us exercise ourselves
with these reasonings. For it is no loss to be silent when insulted, but it is, on the contrary,
to defend one’s self when insulted. Since were it a fault silently to bear what is said, Christ
would never have told us, “If one smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.”
( Matt. v. 39.)2436 If then our enemy say what is not true, let us on this account even pity
him, because he draws down upon him the punishment and vengeance of the accusers,2437

being unworthy even to read the Scriptures. For to the sinner God saith, “Why declarest
thou My statutes, and takest My covenant in thy mouth? Thou satest and spakest against
thy brother.” ( Ps. l. 16 and 20 , LXX.) And if he speak the truth, so also he is to be pitied;
since even the Pharisee spake the truth; yet he did no harm to him who heard him, but rather
good, while he deprived himself of ten thousand blessings, enduring shipwreck by this accusation.
So that either way it is he that suffers injury, not thou; but thou, if thou art sober,
wilt have double gain; both the propitiating God by thy silence, and the becoming yet more
discreet, the gaining an opportunity from what hath been said to correct what has been
done, and the despising mortal glory. For this is the source of our pain, that many gape
upon the opinion of men. If we are minded to be thus truly wise, we shall know well that
human things are nothing. Let us learn then, and having reckoned up our faults, let us accomplish
their correction in time, and let us determine to correct one this month, another
next month, and a third in that which follows. And so mounting as it were by steps, let us
get to heaven by a Jacob’s ladder. For the ladder seems to me to signify in a riddle by that
vision the gradual ascent by means of virtue, by which it is possible for us to ascend from
earth to heaven, not using material steps, but improvement and correction of manners. Let
us then lay hold on this means of departure and ascent, that having obtained heaven, we
may also enjoy all the blessings there, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXIV.</head>
<p>John xviii. 37</p>
<p>“To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness
unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth My Voice.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> A marvelous thing is longsuffering; it places the soul as in a quiet harbor, fleeing it
from tossings2438 and evil spirits. And this everywhere Christ hath taught us, but especially
now, when He is judged, and dragged, and led about. For when He was brought to Annas,
He answered with great gentleness, and, to the servant who smote Him, said what had power
to bring down all his insolence; thence having gone to Caiaphas, then to Pilate, and having
spent the whole night in these scenes, He all through exhibiteth His own mildness; and
when they said that He was a malefactor, and were not able to prove it, He stood silent; but
when He was questioned concerning the Kingdom, then He spake to Pilate, instructing him,
and leading him in to2439 higher matters. But why was it that Pilate made the enquiry not
in their presence, but apart, having gone into the judgment hall? He suspected something
great respecting Him, and wished, without being troubled by the Jews, to learn all accurately.
Then when he said, “What hast thou done?” on this point Jesus made no answer; but concerning
that of which Pilate most desired to hear, namely, His Kingdom, He answered,
saying, “My Kingdom is not of this world.” That is, “I am indeed a King, yet not such an
one as thou suspectest, but far more glorious,” declaring2440 by these words and those which
follow, that no evil had been done by Him. For one who saith, “To this end was I born, and
for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth,” showeth,
that no evil hath been done by Him. Then when He saith, “Every one that is of the truth
heareth My voice,” He draweth him on by these means, and persuadeth him to become a
listener to the words. “For if,” saith He, “any one is true, and desireth these things,2441 he
will certainly hear Me.” And, in fact, He so took him by these short words, that he said,
<lg>
<l>Ver. 38. “What is truth?”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But for the present he applieth himself to what was pressing, for he knew that this
question needed time, and desired to rescue Him from the violence of the Jews. Wherefore
he went out, and what said he?</p>
<p>“I find no fault in him.”2442</p>
<note type="footnote">2438 or, “waves,” or, “winds.”</note>

<pb n="611"/>
<p>Consider how prudently he acted. He said not, “Since he hath sinned, and is deserving
of death, forgive him on account of the Feast”;2443 but having first acquitted Him of all guilt,
he asks them over and above, if they were not minded to dismiss Him as innocent, yet as
guilty to forgive Him on account of the time. Wherefore he added,</p>
<p>Ver. 39, 40. “Ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover”; then
in a persuasory way, “Will ye therefore that I release the king of the Jews? Then cried they
all, Not this man, but Barabbas.”2444</p>
<p>O accursed decision! They demand those like mannered with themselves, and let the
guilty go; but bid him punish the innocent. For this was their custom from old time. But do
thou all through observe the lovingkindness of the Lord in these circumstances. Pilate
scourged Him2445 perhaps desiring to exhaust and to soothe the fury of the Jews. For when
he had not been able to deliver Him by his former measures, being anxious to stay the evil
at this point, he scourged Him, and permitted to be done what was done, the robe and crown
to be put on Him, so as to relax their anger. Wherefore also he led Him forth to them crowned
( ver. 5 ), that, seeing the insult which had been done to Him, they might recover a little
from their passion, and vomit their venom. “And how would the soldiers have done this,
had it not been the command of their ruler?” To gratify the Jews. Since it was not by his
command that they at first went in2446 by night, but to please the Jews; they dared anything
for money. But He, when so many and such things were done, yet stood silent, as He had
done during the enquiry, and answered nothing. And do thou not merely hear these things,
but keep them continually in thy mind, and when thou beholdest the King of the world and
of all Angels, mocked of the soldiers, by words and by actions, and bearing all silently, do
thou imitate Him by deeds thyself. For when Pilate had called Him the King of the Jews,
and they now put about Him the ap parel of mockery, then Pilate having led Him out, said,
<lg>
<l>Ver. 4, 5. “I find no fault against him. He therefore went forth, wearing the crown.”2447</l>
<l>But not even so was their rage quenched, but they cried out,</l>

<p>Whence it is clear that he had permitted what had been done before, because of their
madness.</p>
<p>“For I,” he saith, “find no fault in him.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> See in how many ways the judge makes His defense, continually acquitting Him of
the charges; but none of these things shamed the dogs from their purpose. For the, “Take
ye him and crucify him,” is the expression of one clearing himself of the guilt, and thrusting
them forward to an action not permitted to them. They therefore had brought Him, in order
that the thing might be done by the decision of the governor; but the contrary fell out, that
He was rather acquitted than condemned by the governor’s decision. Then, because they
were ashamed,</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “We have,” they said, “a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself the Son of God.”</p>
<p>“How then when the judge said, ‘Take ye him, and judge him according to your law,’
did ye reply, ‘It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,’ while here ye fly to the law?
And consider the charge, ‘He made himself the Son of God.’ Tell me, is this a ground of
accusation, that He who performed the deeds of the Son of God should call Himself the Son
of God?” What then doth Christ? While they held this dialogue one with the other, He held
His peace, fulfilling that saying of the Prophet, that “He openeth not his mouth: in His humiliation
His judgment was taken away.” ( Isa. liii. 7, 8 , LXX.)</p>
<p>Then Pilate is alarmed2449 when he hears from them, that He made Himself the Son of
God, and dreads lest the assertion may possibly be true, and he should seem to transgress;
but these men who had learnt this, both by His deeds and words, did not shudder, but are
putting Him to death for the very reasons for which they ought to have worshiped Him. On
this account he no more asks Him, “What hast thou done?” but, shaken by fear, he begins
the enquiry again, saying, “Art thou the Christ?” But He answered not. For he who had
heard, “To this end was I born, and for this came I,” and, “My Kingdom is not of this world,”
he, when he ought to have opposed His enemies and delivered Him, did not so, but seconded
the fury of the Jews. Then they being in every way silenced, make their cry issue in a political
charge, saying, “He that maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cæsar.” ( Ver. 12.) Pilate
ought therefore to have accurately enquired, whether He had aimed at sovereignty, and set
His hand to expel Cæsar from the kingdom. But he makes not an exact enquiry, and therefore
Christ answered him nothing, because He knew that he asked all the questions idly.2450
<note type="footnote">2449 Ver. 8, 9. “When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; and went again into the
judgment-hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. ” N.T.</note>

Besides, since His works bare witness to Him, He would not prevail by word, nor compose
any defense, showing that He came voluntarily to this condition. When He was silent, Pilate
saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?”2451</p>
<p>Seest thou how he condemned himself beforehand; for, “if the whole rests with thee,
why dost not thou let Him go, when thou hast found no fault in Him?” When then Pilate
had uttered the sentence against himself, then He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 11. “He that delivered Me unto thee hath the greater sin.”</p>
<p>Showing that he also was guilty of sin. Then, to pull down his pride and arrogance, He
saith,</p>
<p>“Thou wouldst have no power except it were given thee.”2452</p>
<p>Showing that this did not come to pass merely in the common order of events,2453 but
that it was accomplished mystically. Then lest, when thou hearest, “Except it were given
thee,” thou shouldest deem that Pilate was exempt from all blame, on this account therefore
He said, “Therefore he that delivered Me unto thee hath the greater sin.” “And yet if it was
given, neither he nor they were liable to any charge.” “Thou objectest idly; for the ‘given’ in
this place means what is ‘allowed’; as though He had said, ‘He hath permitted these things
to be, yet not for that are ye clear of the wickedness.’” He awed Pilate by the words, and
proffered a clear defense. On which account that person sought to release Him; but they
again cried out, saying,2454</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend.”</p>
<p>For when they profited nothing by bringing charges drawn from their own law, they
wickedly betook themselves to external laws, saying,</p>
<p>“Every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.”</p>
<p>And where hath this Man appeared as a tyrant? Whence can ye prove it? By the purple
robe? By the diadem? By the dress?2455 By the soldiers? Did not He ever walk unattended,
save by His twelve disciples, following in every point a humble mode of living, both as to
food, and clothing, and habitation? But O what shamelessness and ill-time cowardice! For
Pilate, deeming that he should now incur some danger were he to overlook these words,
comes forth as though to enquire into the matter,2456 (for the “sitting down” showed this,)

but without making2457 any enquiry, he gave Him up to them, thinking to shame them. For
to prove that he did it for this purpose, hear what he saith.</p>
<p>Ver. 14, 15. “Behold your king!” But when they said, “Crucify him,” he added again,
“Shall I crucify your king?” But they cried out, “We have no king but Cæsar.”2458</p>
<p>Of their own will they subjected themselves to punishment; therefore also God gave
them up, because they were the first to cast themselves out from His providence and superintendence;
and since with one voice they rejected His sovereignty, He allowed them to fall
by their own suffrages. Still what had been said should have been sufficient to calm their
passion, but they feared, lest, being let go, He should again draw the multitudes, and they
did all they could to prevent this. For a dreadful thing is love of rule, dreadful and able to
destroy the soul; it was on account of this that they had never heard Him. And yet Pilate,
in consequence of a few words, desired to let Him go, but they pressed on, saying, “Crucify
him.” And why did they strive to kill Him in this manner? It was a shameful death. Fearing
therefore lest there should afterwards be any remembrance of Him, they desired to bring
Him to the accursed punishment, not knowing that truth is exalted by hindrances. To prove
that they had this suspicion, listen to what they say;2459 “We have heard that that deceiver
said, After three days I will rise again” ( Matt. xxvii. 63 ); on this account they made all this
stir, turning things upside down,2460 that they might ruin matters in after time.2461 And
the ill-ordered people, corrupted by their rulers, cried out continually, “Crucify him!”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But let us not merely read of these things, but bear them in our mind; the crown of
thorns, the robe, the reed, the blows, the smiting on the cheek, the spittings, the irony. These
things, if continually meditated on, are sufficient to take down all anger; and if we be mocked
at, if we suffer injustice, let us still say, “The servant is not greater than his Lord” ( c. xiii. 16
); and let us bring forward the words of the Jews, which they uttered in their madness, saying,
“Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil” ( c. viii. 48 ); and, “He casteth out devils by
Beelzebub.” ( Luke xi. 15.) For on this account He bare all these things, in order that we
might walk in His footsteps, and endure those mockings which disturb more than any other
kind of reproach. Yet nevertheless He not only bare these things, but even used every means
to save and deliver from the appointed punishment those who did them. For He sent the
Apostles also for their salvation, at least thou hearest them saying, that, “We2462 know that

through ignorance ye did it” ( Acts iii. 17 ); and by these means drawing them to repentance.
This let us also imitate; for nothing so much maketh God propitious as the loving enemies,
and doing good to those who despitefully use us. When a man insults thee, look not to him,
but to the devil who moves him, and against him empty all thy wrath, but pity the man who
is moved by him. For if lying is from the devil, to be angry without a cause is much more
so. When thou seest one turning another into ridicule, consider that it is the devil who
moves him, for mockings belong not to Christians. For he who hath been bidden to mourn,
and hath heard, “Woe, ye that laugh” ( Luke vi. 25 ), and who after this insults, and jests,
and is excited, demands not reproach from us, but sorrow, since Christ also was troubled
when He thought on Judas. All these things therefore let us practice in our actions, for if we
act not rightly in these, we have come to no purpose and in vain into the world. Or rather
we have come to our harm, for faith is not sufficient to bring men to the Kingdom, nay, it
even hath power2463 in this way most to condemn those who exhibit an ill life; for He “which
knew his Lord’s will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes” ( Luke xii. 47 ); and
again, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.” ( c. xv. 22.) What
excuse then shall we have, who have been set within the palace, and deemed worthy to
stoop 2464 down and enter into the sanctuary, and have been made partakers of the releasing
Mysteries,2465 and who yet are worse than the Greeks, who have shared in none of these
things? For if they for the sake of vainglory have shown so much true wisdom, much more
ought we to go after all virtue, because it is pleasing to God. But at present we do not even
despise wealth; while they have often been careless of their life, and in wars have given up
their children to their madness about devils,2466 and have despised nature for the sake of
their devils, but we do not even despise money for the sake of Christ, nor anger on account
of God’s will, but are inflamed, and in no better state than the fevered. And just as they,
when possessed by their malady, are all burning, so we, suffocated as by some fire, can stop
at no point of desire, increasing both anger and avarice. On this account I am ashamed and
astonished, when I behold among the Greeks men despising riches, but all mad among
ourselves. For even if we could find some despising riches, we should find that they have
been made2467 captive by other vices, by passion or envy; and a hard thing it is to discover
true wisdom without a blemish.2468 But the reason is, that we are not earnest to get our
remedies from the Scriptures, nor do we apply ourselves to those Scriptures with compunc-

tion, and sorrow, and groaning, but carelessly, if at any time we chance to be at leisure.
Therefore when a great rush of worldly matters comes, it overwhelms all; and if there hath
been any profit, destroys it. For if a man have a wound, and after putting on a plaster, do
not tie it tight, but allow it to fall off, and expose his sore to wet, and dust, and heat, and ten
thousand other things able to irritate it, he will get no good; yet not by reason of the inefficacy
of the remedies, but by reason of his own carelessness. And this also is wont to happen to
us, when we attend but little to the divine oracles, but give ourselves up wholly and incessantly
to things of this life; for thus all the seed is choked, and all is made unfruitful. That this may
not be the case, let us look carefully a little, let us look up to heaven, let us bend down to the
tombs and coffins of the departed. For the same end awaiteth us, and the same necessity of
departure will often come upon us before the evening. Prepare we then for this expedition;2469
there is need of many supplies for the journey,2470 for great is the heat there, and great the
drought, and great the solitude. Henceforth there is no reposing at an inn, there is no buying
anything, when one hath not taken all from hence. Hear at least what the virgins say, “Go
ye to them that sell” ( Matt. xxv. 9 ); but they who went found not. Hear what Abraham
saith, “A gulf between us and you.” ( Luke xvi. 26.) Hear what Ezekiel saith concerning that
day, that Noah, and Job, and Daniel shall in nowise deliver their sons. ( Ezek. xiv. 14.) But
may it never come to pass that we hear these words, but that having taken hence sufficient
provision for our way to eternal life, we may behold with boldness our Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>John xix. 16–18</p>
<p>“Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led Him
away. And He, bearing His Cross, went forth into a place called the place of a skull,2471
where they crucified Him.”2472</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Successes have terrible power to cast down or draw aside those who take not heed.
Thus the Jews, who at first enjoyed the influence2473 of God, sought the law of royalty from
the Gentiles, and in the wilderness after the manna remembered the onions. In the same
way here, refusing the Kingdom of Christ, they invited to themselves that of Cæsar.
Wherefore God set a king over them, according to their own decision. When then Pilate
heard these things, he delivered Him to be crucified. Utterly without reason. For when he
ought to have enquired whether Christ had aimed at sovereign power, he pronounced the
sentence through fear alone. Yet that this might not befall him, Christ said beforehand, “My
kingdom is not of this world”; but he having given himself wholly up to present things,
would practice no great amount of wisdom. And yet his wife’s dream should have been
sufficient to terrify him; but by none of these things was he made better, nor did he look to
heaven, but delivered Him up. And now they laid the cross upon Him as a malefactor. For
even the wood they abominated, and endured not even to touch it. This was also the case
in the type; for Isaac bare the wood. But then the matter stopped at the will of his father,2474
for it was the type; while here it proceeded to action, for it was the reality.</p>
<p>“And He came to the place of a skull.” Some say that Adam died there, and there lieth;
and that Jesus in this place where death had reigned, there also set up the trophy. For He
went forth bearing the Cross as a trophy over the tyranny of death: and as conquerors do,
so He bare upon His shoulders the symbol of victory. What matter if the Jews did2475 these
things with a different intent. They crucified Him too with thieves, in this also unintentionally
fulfilling prophecy; for what they did for insult contributed to the truth, that thou mayest
learn how great is its power, since the Prophet had foretold of old, that “He was numbered
with the transgressors.” ( Isa. liii. 12.) The devil therefore wished to cast a veil over what
was done, but was unable; for the three were crucified, but Jesus alone was glorious, that
thou mayest learn, that His power effected all. Yet the miracles took place when the three

had been nailed to the cross; but no one attributed anything of what was done to either of
those others, but to Jesus only; so entirely was the plot of the devil rendered vain,2476 and
all returned upon his own head. For even of these two, one was saved. He therefore did not
insult the glory of the Cross,2477 but contributed to it not a little. For it was not a less matter
than shaking the rocks, to change a thief upon the cross, and to bring him unto Paradise.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “And Pilate wrote a title.”2478</p>
<p>At the same time requiting the Jews, and making a defense for Christ. For since they
had given Him up as worthless, and attempted to confirm this sentence by making Him
share the punishment of the robbers, in order that for the future it might be in no man’s
power to prefer evil charges against him, or to accuse him as a worthless and wicked person,
to close moreover their mouths and the mouths of all who might desire to accuse Him, and
to show that they had risen up against their own King, Pilate thus placed, as on a trophy,
those letters, which utter a clear voice, and show forth His Victory, and proclaim His
Kingdom, though not in its completeness. And this he made manifest not in a single tongue,
but in three languages; for since it was likely that there would be a mixed multitude among
the Jews on account of the Feast, in order that none might be ignorant of the defense, he
publicly recorded2479 the madness of the Jews, in all the languages. For they bore malice
against Him even when crucified.2480 “Yet what did this harm you?2481 Nothing. For if He
was a mortal and weak, and was about to become extinct, why did ye fear the letters asserting
that He is the King of the Jews?” And what do they ask? “Say that ‘he said.’ For now it is an
assertion, and a general sentence, but if ‘he said’ be added, the charge is shown to be one
arising from his own rashness and arrogance.” Still Pilate was not turned aside, but stood
to his first decision. And it is no little thing that is dispensed even from this circumstance,
but the whole matter. For since the wood of the cross was buried, because no one was careful
to take it up, inasmuch as fear was pressing, and the believers were hurrying to other urgent
matters; and since it was in after times to be sought for, and it was likely that the three crosses
would lie together, in order that the Lord’s might not be unknown, it was made manifest to
all, first by its lying in the middle, and then by the title. For those of the thieves had no titles.</p>

<p><del>2.</del> The soldiers parted the garments, but not the coat.2482 See the prophecies in every
instance fulfilled by their wickednesses; for this also had been predicted of old; yet there
were three crucified, but the matters of the prophecies2483 were fulfilled in Him. For why
did they not this in the case of the others, but in His case only? Consider too, I pray you,
the exactness of the prophecy. For the Prophet saith not only, that they “parted,” but that
they “did not part.” The rest therefore they divided, the coat they divided not, but committed
the matter to a decision by lot. And the, “Woven from the top” ( ver. 23 ) is not put without
a purpose; but some say that a figurative assertion is declared by it, that the Crucified was
not simply man, but had also the Divinity from above.2484 Others say that the Evangelist
describes the very form of the coat.2485 For since in Palestine they put together two strips
of cloth and so weave their garments, John, to show that the coat was of this kind, saith,
“Woven from the top”; and to me he seems to say this, alluding to the poorness of the garments,
and that as in all other things, so in dress also, He followed a simple2486 fashion.</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “These things the soldiers did.” But He on the Cross, committeth His mother
to the disciple,2487 teaching us even to our last breath to show every care for our parents.
When indeed she unseasonably troubled Him, He said, “Woman, what have I to do with
thee?” ( c. ii. 4.) And, “Who is My mother?” ( Matt. xii. 48.) But here He showeth much
loving affection, and committeth her to the disciple whom He loved. Again John conceals
himself, in modesty; for had he desired to boast, he would have also put in the cause for
which he was loved, since probably it was some great and wonderful one. But wherefore
doth He converse on nothing else with John, nor comfort him when desponding? Because
it was no time for comforting by words; besides, it was no little thing for him to be honored
with such honor, and to receive the reward of steadfastness. But do thou consider, I pray,
how even on the cross He did everything without being troubled, speaking with the disciple
concerning His mother, fulfilling prophecies, holding forth good hopes to the thief. Yet
<note type="footnote">2482 Ver. 23, 24. “Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made four parts,

And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.”</note>

<pb n="620"/>
before He was crucified He appeareth sweating, agonized, fearing. What then can this mean?
Nothing difficult, nothing doubtful. There indeed the weakness of nature had been shown,
here was being shown the excess of Power. Besides, by these two things He teacheth us, even
if before things terrible we be troubled, not on that account to shrink from things terrible,
but when we have embarked in the contest to deem all things2488 possible and easy. Let us
then not tremble at death. Our soul hath by nature the love of life, but it lies with us either
to loose the bands of nature, and make this desire weak; or else to tighten them, and make
the desire more tyrannous. For as we have the desire of sexual intercourse, but when we
practice true wisdom we render the desire weak, so also it falls out in the case of life; and as
God hath annexed carnal desire to the generation of children, to maintain a succession
among us, without however forbidding us from traveling the higher road of continence; so
also He hath implanted in us the love of life, forbidding us from destroying ourselves, but
not hindering our despising the present life. And it behooves us, knowing this, to observe
due measure, and neither to go at any time to death of our own accord, even though ten
thousand terrible things possess us; nor yet when dragged to it, for the sake of what is
pleasing to God, to shrink back from and fear it, but boldly to strip for it, preferring the future
to the present life.</p>
<p>But the women stood by the Cross, and the weaker sex then appeared the manlier ( ver.
25 ); so entirely henceforth were all things transformed.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And He, having committed His mother to John, said, “Behold thy Son.” ( Ver. 26.)
O the honor! with what honor did He honor the disciple! when He Himself was now departing,
He committed her to the disciple to take care of. For since it was likely that, being His
mother, she would grieve, and require protection, He with reason entrusted her to the beloved.
To him He saith, “Behold thy mother.” ( Ver. 27.) This He said, knitting them together
in charity; which the disciple understanding, took her to his own home. “But why made He
no mention of any other woman, although another stood there?” To teach us to pay more
than ordinary respect to our mothers. For as when parents oppose us on spiritual matters,
we must not even own them, so when they do not hinder us, we ought to pay them all becoming
respect, and to prefer them before others, because they begat us, because they bred
us up, because they bare for us ten thousand terrible things. And by these words He silenceth
the shamelessness of Marcion; for if He were not born according to the flesh, nor had a
mother, wherefore taketh He such forethought for her alone?</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished.”</p>
<p>That is, “that nothing was wanting to the Dispensation.” For He was everywhere desirous
to show, that this Death was of a new kind, if indeed the whole lay in the power of the Person
dying, and death came not on the Body before He willed it; and He willed it after He had
<note type="footnote">2488 al. “all things are.”</note>

<pb n="621"/>
fulfilled all things. Therefore also He said, “I have power to lay down My life; and I have
power to take it again.” ( c. x. 18.) Knowing therefore that all things were fulfilled, He saith,</p>
<p>“I thirst.”2489</p>
<p>Here again fulfilling a prophecy. But consider, I pray, the accursed nature of the
bystanders. Though we have ten thousand enemies, and have suffered intolerable things at
their hands, yet when we see them perishing, we relent; but they did not even so make peace
with Him, nor were tamed by what they saw, but rather became more savage, and increased
their irony; and having brought to Him vinegar on a sponge,2490 as men bring it to the
condemned, thus they gave Him to drink; since it is on this account that the hyssop is added.</p>
<p>Ver. 30. “Having therefore received it, He saith, It is finished.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He doth all things calmly, and with power? And what follows shows
this. For when all had been completed,</p>
<p>“He bowed His head, (this had not been nailed,) and gave up2491 the ghost.”</p>
<p>That is, “died.” Yet to expire does not come2492 after the bowing the head; but here, on
the contrary, it doth. For He did not, when He had expired, bow His head, as happens with
us, but when He had bent His head, then He expired. By all which things the Evangelist hath
shown, that He was Lord of all.</p>
<p>But the Jews, on the other hand, who swallowed the camel and strained at the gnat,
having wrought so atrocious a deed, are very precise concerning the day.</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “Because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the
cross2493 —they besought Pilate that their legs might be broken.”2494</p>
<p>Seest thou how strong a thing is truth? By means of the very things which are the objects
of their zeal, prophecy is fulfilled, for by occasion of those things, this plain prediction, unconnected
with them,2495 receives its accomplishment. For the soldiers2496 when they came,
brake the legs of the others, but not those of Christ. Yet these to gratify the Jews pierced His
side with a spear, and now insulted the dead body. O abominable and accursed purpose!

Yet, beloved, be not thou confounded, be not thou desponding; for the things which these
men did from a wicked will, fought on the side of the truth. Since there was a prophecy,
saying, (from this circumstance,2497 “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.” ( Ver.
37; Zech. xii. 10.) And not this only, but the deed then dared was a demonstration of the
faith, to those who should afterwards disbelieve; as to Thomas, and those like him. With
this too an ineffable mystery was accomplished. For “there came forth water and blood.”
Not without a purpose, or by chance, did those founts come forth, but because by means of
these two together the Church consisteth.2498 And the initiated know it, being by water indeed
regenerate, and nourished by the Blood and the Flesh. Hence the Mysteries take their
beginning; that2499 when thou approachest to that awful cup, thou mayest so approach, as
drinking from the very side.</p>
<p>Ver. 35. “And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true.”2500</p>
<p>That is, “I heard it not from others, but was myself present and saw it, and the testimony
is true.” As may be supposed. For he relates an insult done; he relates not anything great
and admirable, that thou shouldest suspect his narrative; but securing the mouths of heretics,
and loudly proclaiming beforehand the Mysteries that should be, and beholding the treasure
laid up in them, he is very exact concerning what took place. And that prophecy also is fulfilled,</p>
<p>Ver. 36. “A bone of Him shall not be broken.”2501 ( Ex. xii. 46; Num. ix. 12.)</p>
<p>For even if this was said with reference to the lamb of the Jews, still it was for the sake
of the reality that the type preceded, and in Him the prophecy was more fully accomplished.
On this account the Evangelist brought forward the Prophet. For since by continually producing
himself as witness he would have seemed unworthy of credit, he brings Moses to
help him, and saith, that neither did this come to pass without a purpose, but was written
before of old. And this is the meaning of the words, “A bone of Him shall not be broken.”
Again he confirms the Prophet’s words by his own witness. “These things,” saith he, “I have
told you, that ye might learn that great is the connection of the type with the reality.” Seest
thou what pains he takes to make that believed which seemed to be matter of reproach, and
bringing shame? For that the soldier should insult even the dead body, was far worse than
being crucified. “But still, even these things,” he saith, “I have told, and told with much
earnestness, ‘that ye might believe.’ ( Ver. 35.) Let none then be unbelieving, nor through

<p>Ver. 38. “After this came Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple.”2503</p>
<p>Not one of the twelve, but perhaps one of the seventy. For now deeming that the anger
of the Jews was quenched by the Cross, they approached without fear, and took charge of
His funeral. Joseph therefore came and asked the favor from Pilate, which he granted; why
should he not? Nicodemus also assists him, and furnishes a costly burial. For they were still
disposed to think of Him as a mere man. And they brought those2504 spices whose especial
nature is to preserve the body for a long time, and not to allow it quickly to yield to corruption,
which was an act of men imagining nothing great respecting Him; but anyhow, they
exhibited very loving affection. But how did no one of the twelve come, neither John, nor
Peter, nor any other of the more distinguished disciples? Nor doth the writer conceal this
point. If any one say that it was from fear of the Jews, these men also 2505 were occupied by
the same fear; for Joseph too was, it saith, “A secret (disciple) for fear of the Jews.” And not
one can say that Joseph acted thus because he greatly despised them,2506 but though himself
afraid, still he came. But John who was present, and had seen Him expire, did nothing of
the kind. It seems to me that Joseph was a man of high rank, (as is clear from the funeral,)
and known2507 to Pilate, on which account also he obtained the favor; and then he buried
Him, not as a criminal, but magnificently, after the Jewish fashion, as some great and admirable
one.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> And because they were straitened by the time, (since the Death took place at the
ninth hour, and it is probable, that what with going to Pilate and what with taking down
the body, evening would come upon them when it was not lawful to work,) they laid Him
in the tomb that was near.2508 And it is providentially ordered,2509 that He should be placed

and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and
brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus, and
wound it in the linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.”</note>

in a new tomb, wherein no one had been placed before, that His Resurrection might not be
deemed to be that of some other who lay there with Him; and that the disciples might be
able easily to come and be spectators of what came to pass, because the place was near; and
that not they alone should be witnesses of His burial, but His enemies also, for the placing
seals on the tomb, and the sitting by of the soldiers to watch it, were the actions of men
testifying to the burial. For Christ earnestly desired that this should be confessed, no less
than the Resurrection. Wherefore also the disciples are very earnest about this, the showing
that He died. For the Resurrection all succeeding time would confirm, but the Death, if at
that time it had been partially concealed, or not made very manifest, was likely to harm the
account of the Resurrection. Nor was it for these reasons only that He was laid near, but
also that the story about the stealing might be proved false.</p>
<p>“The first day of the week” (that is, the Lord’s day) “cometh Mary Magdalene, very early
in the morning,2510 and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.” ( Ch. xx. ver. 1.)</p>
<p>For He arose while both stone and seals lay over Him; but because it was necessary that
others should be fully satisfied, the tomb was opened after the Resurrection, and thus what
had come to pass was confirmed. This then was what moved Mary. For being entirely full
of loving affection towards her Master, when the Sabbath was past, she could not bear to
rest, but came very early in the morning, desiring to find some consolation from the place.
But when she saw the place, and the stone2511 taken away, she neither entered in nor stooped
down, but ran to the disciples,2512 in the greatness of her longing; for this was what she
earnestly desired, she wished very speedily to learn what had become of the body. This was
the meaning of her running, and her words declare it.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “They have taken away,” she saith, “my Lord,2513 and I know not where they
have laid Him.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how she knew not as yet anything clearly concerning the Resurrection, but
thought there had been a removal of the body, and tells all simply to the disciples? And the
Evangelist hath not deprived the woman of such a praise, nor thought it shame that they
should have learnt these things first from her who had passed the night in watching. Thus
everywhere doth the truth-loving nature of his disposition shine forth. When then she came
and said these things, they hearing them, draw near with great eagerness to the sepulcher,2514

and see the linen clothes lying, which was a sign of the Resurrection. For neither, if any
persons had removed the body, would they before doing so have stripped it; nor if any had
stolen it, would they have taken the trouble to remove the napkin, and roll it up, and lay it
in a place by itself; but how? they would have taken the body as it was. On this account John
tells us by anticipation that it was buried with much myrrh, which glues linen to the body
not less firmly than lead; in order that when thou hearest that the napkins lay apart, thou
mayest not endure those who say that He was stolen. For a thief would not have been so
foolish as to spend so much trouble on a superfluous matter. For why should he undo the
clothes? and how could he have escaped detection if he had done so? since he would probably
have spent much time in so doing, and be found out by delaying and loitering. But why do
the clothes lie apart, while the napkin was wrapped together by itself? That thou mayest
learn that it was not the action of men in confusion or haste, the placing some in one place,
some in another, and the wrapping them together. From this they believed in the Resurrection.
On this account Christ afterwards appeared to them, when they were convinced by
what they had seen. Observe too here again the absence of boastfulness in the Evangelist,
how he witnesses to the exactness of Peter’s search. For he himself having gotten before
Peter, and having seen the linen clothes, enquired not farther, but withdrew; but that fervent
one passing farther in, looked at everything carefully, and saw somewhat more, and then
the other too was summoned to the sight.2515 For he entering after Peter, saw the graveclothes
lying, and separate. Now to separate, and to place one thing by itself, and another,
after rolling it up, by itself, was the act of some one doing things carefully, and not in a
chance way, as if disturbed.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But do thou, when thou hearest that thy Lord arose naked, cease from thy madness
about funerals; for what is the meaning of that superfluous and unprofitable2516 expense,
which brings much loss to the mourners, and no gain to the departed, or (if we must say
that it brings anything) rather harm? For the costliness of burial hath often caused the
breaking open of tombs, and hath caused him to be cast out naked and unburied, who had
been buried with much care. But alas for vainglory! How great the tyranny which it exhibits
even in sorrow! how great the folly! Many, that this may not happen, having cut in pieces
those fine clothes, and filled them with many spices, so that they may be doubly useless to
those who would insult the dead, then commit them to the earth. Are not these the acts of
madmen? of men beside themselves? to make a show of their ambition, and then to destroy
<note type="footnote">sepulcher, and seeth the linen clothes lie; and the napkin that was about His head, not lying with the linen clothes,
but wrapped together in a place by itself.” N.T.</note>

it? “Yea,” saith some one, “it is in order that they may lie safely with the dead that we use
all these contrivances.” Well then, if the robbers do not get them, will not the moths get
them, and the worms? Or if the moths and worms get them not, will not time and the
moisture of putrefaction2517 destroy them? But let us suppose that neither tomb-breakers,
nor moths, nor worms, nor time, nor anything else, destroy what lies in the tomb, but that
the body itself remains untouched until the Resurrection, and these things are preserved
new and fresh and fine; what advantage is there from this to the departed, when the body
is raised naked, while these remain here, and profit us nothing for those accounts which
must be given? “Wherefore then,” saith some one, “was it done in the case of Christ?” First
of all, do not compare these with human matters, since the harlot poured even ointment
upon His holy feet. But if we must speak on these things, we say, that they were done when
the doers knew not the word of the Resurrection; therefore it saith, “As was the manner of
the Jews.” For they who honored Christ2518 were not of the twelve, but were those who did
not honor Him greatly. The twelve honored Him not in this way, but by death and massacre
and dangers for His sake. That other indeed was honor, but far inferior to this of which I
have spoken. Besides, as I began by saying, we are now speaking of men, but at that time
these things were done with relation to the Lord. And that thou mayest learn that Christ
made no account of these things, He said, “Ye saw Me an hungered, and ye fed Me; thirsty,
and ye gave Me drink; naked, and ye clothed Me” ( Matt. xxv. 35 ); but nowhere did He say,
“dead, and ye buried Me.” And this I say not as taking away the custom of burial, (that be
far from me,) but as cutting short its extravagance and unseasonable vanity. “But,” saith
some one, “feeling and grief and sympathy for the departed persuade to this practice.” The
practice doth not proceed from sympathy for the departed, but from vainglory. Since if thou
desirest to sympathize with the dead, I will show thee another way of mourning, and will
teach thee to put on him garments which shall rise again with him, and make him glorious.
For these garments are not consumed by worms, nor wasted by time, nor stolen by tombbreakers.
Of what sort then are these? The clothing of alms-doing; for this is a robe that
shall rise again with him, because the seal of alms-doing is with him. With these garments
shine they who then hear, “Hungering ye fed Me.” These make men distinguished, these
make them glorious, these place them in safety; but those used now are only something for
moths to consume, and a table for worms. And this I say, not forbid ding to use funeral
observance, but bidding you to do it with moderation, so as to cover the body, and not
commit it naked to the earth. For if living He biddeth us have no more than enough to
cover us, much more when dead; since the dead body2519 hath not so much need of garments
<note type="footnote">2517 ἰ χὼρ</note>
<note type="footnote">2518 i.e. in His burial.</note>
<note type="footnote">2519 al. “body of the dead.”</note>

<pb n="627"/>
as when it is living and breathing. For when alive, on account of the cold, and for decency’s
sake, we need the covering of garments, but when dead we require grave-clothes for none
of these reasons, but that the body may not lie naked; and better than grave-clothes we have
the earth, fairest of coverings, and more suited for the nature of such bodies as ours. If then
where there are so many needs we must not search for anything superfluous, much more
where there is no such necessity, is the ostentation unseasonable.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> “But the lookers-on will laugh,” saith some one. Most certainly if there be any
laughter, we need not care much for one so exceedingly foolish; but at present there are
many who rather admire and accept our true wisdom. For these are not the things which
deserve laughter, but those which we do at present, weeping, and wailing, and burying
ourselves with the departed; these things deserve ridicule and punishment. But to show true
wisdom, both in these respects and in the modesty of the attire used, prepares crowns and
praises for us, and all will applaud us, and will admire the power of Christ, and will say,
“Amazing! How great is the power of the Crucified One! He hath persuaded those who are
perishing and wasting, that death is not death; they therefore do not act as perishing men,
but as men who send the dead before them to a distant and better dwelling-place. He hath
persuaded them that this corruptible and earthy body shall put on a garment more glorious
than silk or cloth of gold, the garment of immortality; therefore they are not very anxious
about their burial, but deem a virtuous life to be an admirable winding-sheet.” These things
they will say, if they see us showing true wisdom; but if they behold us bent down with grief,
playing the woman, placing around troops of female mourners, they will laugh, and mock,
and find fault in ten thousand ways, pulling to pieces our foolish expense, our vain labor.
With these things we hear all finding fault; and very reasonably. For what excuse can we
have, when we adorn a body, which is consumed by2520 corruption and worms, and neglect
Christ when thirsting, going about naked, and a stranger? Cease we then from this vain
trouble. Let us perform the obsequies of the departed, as is good both for us and them, to
the glory of God: let us do much alms for their sake, let us send with them the best provision
for the way. For if the memory of admirable men, though dead, hath protected the living,
(for, “I will defend,” it saith, “this city for Mine Own. sake, and for My servant David’s
sake”— 2 Kings xix. 34 ,) much more will alms-doing effect this; for this hath raised even
the dead, as when the widows stood round2521 showing what things Dorcas had made, while
she was with them. ( Acts ix. 39.) When therefore one is about to die, let the friend of that
dying person prepare the obsequies,2522 and persuade2523 the departing one to leave
<note type="footnote">2520 or, “given over to,” lit. “spent upon.”</note>

somewhat to the needy. With these garments let him send him to the grave, leaving2524
Christ his heir. For if they who write kings among their heirs, leave a safe portion to their
relations,2525 when one leaves Christ heir with his children, consider how great good he
will draw down upon himself and all his. These are the right2526 sort of funerals, these profit
both those who remain and those who depart. If we be so buried, we shall be glorious at the
Resurrection-time. But if caring for the body we neglect the soul, we then shall suffer many
terrible things, and incur much ridicule. For neither is it a common unseemliness to depart
without being clothed with virtue, nor is the body, though cast out without a tomb, so disgraced,
as a soul appearing bare of virtue in that day. This let us put on, this let us wrap
around us; it is best to do so during all our lifetime; but if we have in this life been negligent,
let us at least in our end be sober, and charge our relations to help us when we depart by
alms-doing; that being thus assisted by each other, we may attain2527 to much confidence,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
and the Holy Ghost be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>John xx. 10, 11</p>
<p>“Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the
sepulcher, weeping.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Full of feeling somehow is the female sex, and more2528 inclined to pity. I say this,
lest thou shouldest wonder how it could be that Mary wept bitterly at the tomb, while Peter
was in no way so affected. For, “The disciples,” it saith, “went away unto their own home”;
but she stood shedding tears. Because hers was a feeble nature, and she as yet knew not accurately
the account of the Resurrection; whereas they having seen the linen clothes and
believed, departed to their own homes in astonishment. And wherefore went they not
straightway to Galilee, as had been commanded them before the Passion? They waited for
the others, perhaps, and besides they were yet at the height of their amazement. These then
went their way: but she stood at the place, for, as I have said, even the sight of the tomb
tended greatly to comfort her. At any rate, thou seest her, the more to ease her grief, stooping
down,2529 and desiring to behold the place where the body lay. And therefore she received
no small reward for this her great zeal. For what the disciples saw not, this saw the woman
first, Angels2530 sitting, the one at the feet, the other at the head, in white; even the dress2531
was full of much radiance2532 and joy. Since the mind of the woman was not sufficiently
elevated to accept the Resurrection from the proof of the napkins, something more takes
place, she beholdeth something more; Angels sitting in shining garments, so as to raise her
thus awhile from her passionate sorrow, and to comfort her. But they said nothing to her
concerning the Resurrection, yet is she gently led forward in this doctrine. She saw countenances
bright and unusual; she saw shining garments, she heard a sympathizing voice. For
what saith (the Angel)?</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “Woman, why weepest thou?”</p>
<p>By all these circumstances, as though a door was being opened for her, she was led by
little and little to the knowledge of the Resurrection. And the manner of their sitting invited
her to question them, for they showed that they knew what had taken place; on which account
they did not sit together either, but apart from one another. For because it was not likely
<note type="footnote">2528 i.e. more than men.</note>

<pb n="630"/>
that she would dare at once to question them, both by questioning her, and by the manner
of their sitting, they bring her to converse. What then saith she? She speaks very warmly
and affectionately;</p>
<p>“They2533 have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.”</p>
<p>“What sayest thou? Knowest thou not yet anything concerning the Resurrection, but
dost thou still form fancies about His being laid2534 ?” Seest thou how she had not yet received
the sublime doctrine?</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “And when she had thus said, she turned herself back.”2535</p>
<p>And by what kind of consequence is it, that she having spoken to them, and not having
yet heard anything from them, turned back? Methinks that while she was speaking, Christ
suddenly appearing behind her, struck the Angels with awe; and that they having beheld
their Ruler,2536 showed immediately by their bearing, their look, their movements, that they
saw the Lord;2537 and this drew the woman’s attention, and caused her to turn herself
backwards. To them then He appeared on this wise, but not so to the woman, in order not
at the first sight to terrify her, but in a meaner and ordinary form, as is clear from her supposing
that He was the gardener. It was meet to lead one of so lowly a mind to high matters,
not all at once, but gently. He therefore in turn asketh her,</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?”</p>
<p>This showed that He knew what she wished to ask, and led her to make answer. And
the woman, understanding this, doth not again mention the name of Jesus, but as though
her questioner knew the subject of her enquiry replies,</p>
<p>“Sir,2538 if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take
him away.”</p>
<p>Again she speaks of laying down, and taking away, and carrying, as though speaking of
a corpse. But her meaning is this; “If ye have borne him hence for fear of the Jews, tell me,
and I will take him.” Great is the kindness and loving affection of the woman, but as yet
there is nothing lofty with her.2539 Wherefore He now setteth the matter before her, not by
appearance, but by Voice. For as He was at one time known to the Jews, and at another time
unperceived2540 though present; so too in speaking, He, when He chose, then made Himself
<note type="footnote">2533 “because they,” N.T.</note>

<pb n="631"/>
known; as also when He said to the Jews, “Whom seek ye?” they knew neither the Countenance
nor the Voice until He chose. And this was the case here. And He named her name
only,2541 reproaching and blaming her that she entertained such fancies concerning One
who lived. But how was it that,</p>
<p>Ver. 16. “She turned herself, and saith,”2542 if so be that He was speaking to her? It
seems to me, that after having said, “Where have ye laid him?” she turned to the Angels to
ask why they were astonished, and that then Christ, by calling her by name, turned her to
Himself from them, and revealed Himself by His Voice; for when He called her “Mary,”
then she knew Him; so that the recognition was not by His appearance, but by His Voice.
And if any say, “Whence is it clear that the Angels were awestruck, and that on this account
the woman turned herself,” they will in this place say, “whence is it clear that she would
have touched Him, and fallen at His feet?” Now as this is clear from His saying, “Touch Me
not,” so is the other clear from its saying, that she turned herself. But wherefore, said He,</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “Touch Me not”?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Some assert, that she asked for spiritual grace, because she had heard Him when
with the disciples say, “If I go to the Father, ‘I will ask Him, and He shall give you another
Comforter.’” ( c. xiv. 3, 16.) But how could she who was not present with the disciples have
heard this? Besides, such an imagination is far from the meaning here. And how should she
ask, when He had not yet gone to the Father? What then is the sense? Methinks that she
wished still to converse with Him as before, and that in her joy she perceived nothing great
in Him, although He had become far more excellent in the Flesh. To lead her therefore from
this idea, and that she might speak to Him with much awe, (for neither with the disciples
doth He henceforth appear so familiar as before,) He raiseth her thoughts, that she should
give more reverent heed to Him. To have said, “Approach Me not as ye did before, for
matters are not in the same state, nor shall I henceforth be with you in the same way,” would
have been harsh and high-sounding; but the saying,</p>
<p>“I am not yet ascended to the2543 Father,” though not painful to hear, was the saying
of One declaring the same thing. For by saying, “I am not yet ascended,” He showeth that
He hasteth and presseth thither; and that it was not meet that One about to depart thither,
and no longer to converse with men, should be looked on with the same feelings as before.
And the sequel shows that this is the case.</p>
<p>“Go and say unto the brethren, that I go2544 unto My Father, and your Father, unto My
God and your God.”</p>

<p>Yet He was not about to do so immediately, but after forty days. How then saith He
this? With a desire to raise their minds, and to persuade them that He departeth into the
heavens. But the, “To My Father and your Father, to My God, and your God,” belongs to
the Dispensation,2545 since the “ascending” also belongs to His Flesh. For He speaketh these
words to one who had no high thoughts. “Is then the Father His in one way, and ours in
another?” Assuredly then He is. For if He is God of the righteous in a manner different from
that in which He is God of other men, much more in the case of the Son and us. For because
He had said, “Say to the brethren,” in order that they might not imagine any equality from
this, He showed the difference. He was about to sit on His Father’s throne, but they to stand
by.2546 So that albeit in His Subsistence according to the Flesh He became our Brother, yet
in Honor He greatly differed from2547 us, it cannot even be told how much.</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “She therefore departeth, bearing these tidings to the disciples.”2548</p>
<p>So great a good is perseverance and endurance. But how was it that they did not any
more grieve when He was about to depart, nor speak as they had done before? At that time
they were affected in such a way, as supposing that He was about to die; but now that He
was risen again, what reason had they to grieve? Moreover, Mary reported His appearance
and His words, which were enough to comfort them. Since then it was likely that the disciples
on hearing these things would either not believe the woman, or, believing, would grieve that
He had not deemed them worthy of the vision, though He promised to meet them in Galilee;
in order that they might not by dwelling on this be unsettled,2549 He let not a single day
pass, but having brought them to a state of longing, by their knowledge that He was risen,
and by what they heard from the woman, when they were thirsting to see Him, and were
greatly afraid, (which thing itself especially made their yearning greater,) He then, when it
was evening, presented2550 Himself before them, and that very marvelously.2551 And why
did He appear in the “evening”? Because it was probable that they would then especially be
very fearful. But the marvel was, why they did not suppose Him to be an apparition; for He
entered, “when the doors were shut,” and suddenly. The chief cause was, that the woman
beforehand had wrought great faith in them; besides, He showed His countenance to them

clear and mild. He came not by day, in order that all might be collected together. For great
was the amazement; for neither did He knock at the door but all at once stood in the midst,
and showed His side and His hands.2552 At the same time also by His Voice He smoothed
their tossing thought, by saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “Peace be unto you.”</p>
<p>That is, “Be not troubled”; at the same time reminding them of the word which He spake
to them before the Crucifixion, “My peace I leave2553 unto you” ( c. xiv. 27 ); and again, “In
me ye have2554 peace, but” “in the world ye shall have tribulation.” ( c. xvi. 33.)</p>
<p>Ver. 20. “Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.”</p>
<p>Seest thou the words issuing in deeds? For what He said before the Crucifixion, that “I
will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you” ( c.
xvi. 22 ), this He now2555 accomplished in deed; but all these things led them to a most exact
faith. For since they had a truceless war with the Jews, He continually repeated the, “Peace
be unto you,”2556 giving them, to counterbalance the war, the consolation. And so this was
the first word that He spake to them after the Resurrection, (wherefore also Paul continually
saith, “Grace be unto you and peace,”) and to women He giveth good tidings of joy,2557
because that sex was in sorrow, and had received this as the first curse. Therefore He giveth
good tidings suitable respectively, to men, peace, because of their war; joy to women, because
of their sorrow. Then having put away all painful things, He telleth of the successes2558 of
the Cross, and these were the “peace.” “Since then all hindrances have been removed,” He
saith, “and I have made My2559 victory glorious, and all hath been achieved,” (then He saith
afterwards,)</p>
<p>Ver. 21. “As My Father hath sent Me, so send I you.”</p>
<p>“Ye have no difficulty, owing to what hath already come to pass, and to the dignity of
Me who send you.” Here He lifteth up their souls, and showeth them their great cause of
confidence, if so be that they were about to undertake His work. And no longer is an appeal
made to the Father, but with authority He giveth to them the power. For,</p>
<p>Ver. 22, 23. “He breathed on them, and said,2560 Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever

<p>As a king sending forth governors, gives power to cast2561 into prison and to deliver
from it, so in sending these forth, Christ investeth them with the same power. But how saith
He, “If I go not away, He2562 will not come” ( c. xvi. 7 ), and yet giveth them the Spirit?
Some say that He gave not the Spirit, but rendered them fit to receive It, by breathing on
them. For if Daniel when he saw an Angel was afraid, what would not they have suffered
when they received that unspeakable Gift, unless He had first made them learners? Wherefore
He said not, “Ye have received the Holy Ghost,” but, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” Yet one
will not be wrong in asserting that they then also received some spiritual power and grace;
not so as to raise the dead, or to work miracles, but so as to remit sins. For the gifts of the
Spirit are of different kinds; wherefore He added, “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them,” showing what kind of power He was giving. But in the other case,2563
after forty2564 days, they received the power of working miracles. Wherefore He saith, “Ye
shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come2565 upon you, and ye shall be My
witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa.” ( Acts i. 8.) And witnesses they became by
means of miracles, for unspeakable is the grace of the Spirit and multiform the gift. But this
comes to pass, that thou mayest learn that the gift and the power of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, is One. For things which appear to be peculiar to the Father, these are seen
also to belong to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. “How then,” saith some one, “doth none
come to the Son, ‘except the Father draw him’?” ( c. vi. 44.) Why, this very thing is shown
to belong to the Son also. “I,” He saith, “am the Way: no man cometh unto the Father but
by Me.” ( c. xiv. 6.) And observe that it belongeth to the Spirit also; for “No man can call
Jesus Christ Lord, 2566 but by the Holy Ghost.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 3.) Again, we see that the Apostles
were given to the Church at one time by the Father, at another by the Son, at another by the
Holy Ghost, and that the “diversities of gifts” ( 1 Cor. xii. 4 ) belong to the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us then do all we can to have the Holy Spirit with ourselves, and let us treat with
much honor those into whose hands its operation hath been committed. For great is the
dignity of the priests. “Whosesoever sins,” it saith, “ye remit, they are remitted unto them”;
wherefore also Paul saith, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves.”
( Heb. xiii. 17.) And hold them very exceedingly in honor; for thou indeed carest about thine
own affairs, and if thou orderest them well, thou givest2567 no account for others, but the

priest even if he rightly order his own life, if he have not an anxious care for thine, yea and
that of all those around him, will depart with the wicked into hell; and often when not betrayed
by his own conduct, he perishes by yours, if he have not rightly performed all his
part. Knowing therefore the greatness of the danger, give them a large share of your goodwill;
which Paul also implied when he said, “For they watch for your souls,” and not simply so,
but, “as they that shall give account.” ( Heb. xiii. 17.) They ought therefore to receive great
attention from you; but if you join with the rest in trampling upon them, then neither shall
your affairs be in a good condition. For while the steersman continues in good courage, the
crew also will be in safety; but if he be tired out by their reviling him and showing ill-will
against him, he cannot watch equally well, or retain his skill, and without intending it, throws
them into ten thousand mischiefs. And so too the priest, if he enjoy honor2568 from you,
will be able well to order your affairs; but if ye throw them into despondency, ye weaken
their hands, and render them, as well as yourselves, an easy prey to the waves, although they
be very courageous. Consider what Christ saith concerning the Jews. “The Scribes and the
Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; all therefore whatsoever they bid2569 you to do, do ye.” ( Matt.
xxiii. 2, 3.) Now we have not to say, “the priests sit on Moses’ seat,” but “on that of Christ”;
for they have successively received His doctrine. Wherefore also Paul saith, “We are ambassadors
for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” ( 2 Cor. v. 20.) See ye not that in
the case of Gentile rulers, all bow to them, and oftentimes even persons superior in family,
in life, in intelligence, to those who judge them? yet still because of him who hath given
them, they consider none of these things, but respect the decision of their governor, whosoever
he be that receives the rule over them. Is there then such fear when man appoints, but
when God appointeth do we despise him who is appointed, and abuse him, and besmirch
him with ten thousand reproaches, and though forbidden to judge our brethren, do we
sharpen our tongue against our priests? And how can this deserve excuse, when we see not
the beam in our own eye, but are bitterly over-curious about the mote in another’s? Knowest
thou not that by so judging thou makest thine own judgment the harder? And this I say not
as approving of those who exercise their priesthood unworthily, but as greatly pitying and
weeping for them; yet do I not on this account allow that it is right that they should be judged
by those over whom they are set.2570 And although their life be very much spoken against,
thou, if thou take heed to thyself, wilt not be harmed at all2571 in respect of the things
committed to them2572 by God. For if He caused a voice to be uttered by an ass, and bestowed

spiritual blessings by a diviner, working by the foolish mouth and impure tongue of Balaam,
in behalf of the offending Jews, much more for the sake of you the right-minded2573 will
He, though the priests be exceedingly vile, work all the things that are His, and will send the
Holy Ghost. For neither doth the pure draw down that Spirit by his own purity, but it is
grace that worketh all. “For all,” it saith, “is for your sake,2574 whether it be Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas.” ( 1 Cor. iii. 22, 23.) For the things which are placed in the hands of the priest it
is with God alone to give; and however far human wisdom may reach, it will appear inferior
to that grace. And this I say, not in order that we may order our own life carelessly, but that
when some of those set over you are careless livers, you the ruled may not often heap up
evil for yourselves. But why speak I of priests? Neither Angel nor Archangel can do anything
with regard to what is given from God; but the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, dispenseth
all, while the priest lends his tongue and affords his hand. For neither would it be
just that through the wickedness of another, those who come in faith to the symbols of their
salvation should be harmed. Knowing all these things, let us fear God, and hold His priests
in honor, paying them all reverence; that both for our own good deeds, and the attention
shown to them, we may receive a great return from God, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory,
dominion, and honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXVII.</head>
<p>John xx. 24, 25</p>
<p>“But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The
other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said, Except I shall
see in His hands2575 —I will not believe.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> As to believe carelessly and in a random way, comes of an over-easy temper; so to
be beyond measure curious and meddlesome, marks a most gross understanding. On this
account Thomas is held to blame. For he believed not the Apostles when they said, “We
have seen the Lord”; not so much mistrusting them, as deeming the thing to be impossible,
that is to say, the resurrection from the dead. Since he saith not, “I do not believe you,” but,
“Except I put my hand—I do not2576 believe.” But how was it, that when all were collected
together, he alone was absent? Probably after the dispersion which had lately taken place,
he had not returned even then. But do thou, when thou seest the unbelief of the disciple,
consider the lovingkindness of the Lord, how for the sake of a single soul He showed Himself
with His wounds, and cometh in order to save even the one, though he was grosser than
the rest; on which account indeed he sought proof from the grossest of the senses, and would
not even trust his eyes. For he said not, “Except I see,” but, “Except I handle,” he saith, lest
what he saw might somehow be an apparition. Yet the disciples who told him these things,
were at the time worthy of credit, and so was He that promised; yet, since he desired more,
Christ did not deprive him even of this.</p>
<p>And why doth He not appear to him straightway, instead of “after eight days”?2577 (
Ver. 26.) In order that being in the mean time continually instructed by the disciples, and
hearing the same thing, he might be inflamed to more eager desire, and be more ready to
believe for the future. But whence knew he that His side had been opened? From having
heard it from the disciples. How then did he believe partly, and partly not believe? Because
this thing was very strange and wonderful. But observe, I pray you, the truthfulness of the
disciples, how they hide no faults, either their own or others’, but record them with great
veracity.</p>
<p>Jesus again presenteth himself to them, and waiteth not to be requested by Thomas, nor
to hear any such thing, but before he had spoken, Himself prevented him, and fulfilled his
<note type="footnote">2575 “But he said unto them, Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the
print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side.” N.T.</note>

<pb n="638"/>
desire; showing that even when he spake those words to the disciples, He was present. For
He used the same words, and in a manner conveying a sharp rebuke, and instruction for
the future. For having said,</p>
<p>Ver. 26. “Reach hither thy finger, and behold My hands; and reach hither thy hand, and
thrust it into My side”; He added,</p>
<p>“And be not faithless, but believing.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that his doubt proceeded from unbelief? But it was before he had received
the Spirit; after that, it was no longer so, but, for the future, they were perfected.</p>
<p>And not in this way only did Jesus rebuke him, but also by what follows; for when he,
being fully satisfied, breathed again, and cried aloud,</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “My Lord, and my God,” He saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 29. “Because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed; blessed are they who have not
seen, and yet have believed.”</p>
<p>For this is of faith, to receive things not seen; since,“Faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” ( Heb. xi. 1.) And here He pronounceth blessed
not the disciples only, but those also who after them should believe. “Yet,” saith some one,
“the disciples saw and believed.” Yes, but they sought nothing of the kind, but from the
proof of the napkins, they straightway received the word concerning the Resurrection, and
before they saw the body, exhibited all faith. When therefore any one in the present day say,
“I would that I had lived in those times, and had seen Christ working miracles,” let them
reflect, that, “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.”</p>
<p>It is worth enquiring, how an incorruptible body showed the prints of the nails, and
was tangible by a mortal hand. But be not thou disturbed; what took place was a matter of
condescension. For that which was so subtle and light as to enter in when the doors were
shut, was free from all density2578 ; but this marvel was shown, that the Resurrection might
be believed, and that men might know that it was the Crucified One Himself, and that another
rose not in His stead. On this account He arose2579 bearing the signs of the Cross,
and on this account He eateth. At least the Apostles everywhere made this a sign of the Resurrection,
saying, “We, who did eat and drink with Him.” ( Acts x. 41.) As therefore when
we see Him walking on the waves before the Crucifixion, we do not say, that that body is of
a different nature, but of our own; so after the Resurrection, when we see Him with the
prints of the nails, we will no more say, that he is therefore2580 corruptible. For He exhibited
these appearances on account of the disciple.</p>

<p><del>2.</del> Since this Evangelist hath mentioned fewer than the others, he tells us that neither
have all the others mentioned them all, but as many as were sufficient to draw the hearers
to belief. For, “If,” it saith, “they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world
itself could not contain the books.” ( c. xxi. 25.) Whence it is clear, that What they have
mentioned they wrote not for display, but only for the sake of what was useful. For how
could they who omitted the greater part, write these others2581 for display? But why went
they not through them all? Chiefly on account of their number; besides, they also considered,
that he who believed not those they had mentioned, would not give heed to a greater number;
while he who received these, would have no need of another in order to believe. And here
too he seems to me to be for the time speaking of the miracles after the Resurrection.
Wherefore He saith,
<lg>
<l>“In the presence of His disciples.”2582</l>
</lg></p>
<p>For as before the Resurrection it was necessary that many should be done, in order that
they might believe that He was the Son of God, so was it also after the Resurrection, in order
that they might admit that He had arisen. For another reason also he has added, “In the
presence of His disciples,” because He conversed with them alone after the Resurrection;
wherefore also He said, “The world seeth Me no more.” ( c. xiv. 19 .) Then, in order that
thou mayest understand that what was done was done only for the sake of the disciples, he
added,</p>
<p>Ver. 31. “That believing ye might have life in His Name.”2583</p>
<p>Speaking generally to mankind, and showing that not on Him who is believed on, but
on ourselves, he bestows a very great favor. “In His Name,” that is, “through Him”; for He
is the Life.</p>
<p>Chap. xxi. ver. 1. “After these things, Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the
sea of Tiberias.”2584</p>
<p>Seest thou that He remaineth not with them continually, nor as before? He appeared,
for instance, in the evening, and flew away; then after eight days again once, and again flew
away; then after these things by the sea, and again with great terror. But what is the, “showed”?
From this it is clear that He was not seen unless He condescended, because His body was
henceforth incorruptible, and of unmixed purity.2585 But wherefore hath the writer mentioned
the place? To show that he had now taken away the greater part of their fear, so that

they now ventured forth from their dwelling, and went about everywhere. For they were no
longer shut up at home, but had gone into Galilee, avoiding the danger from the Jews. Simon,
therefore, comes to fish. For since neither was He with them continually, nor was the Spirit
yet given, nor they at that time yet entrusted with anything, having nothing to do, they went
after their trade.</p>
<p>Ver. 2. “There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas,2586 and Nathanael,”2587 (he
that was called by Philip,) “and the sons of Zebedee, and two others.”2588</p>
<p>Having then nothing to do, they went to their fishing,2589 and this same they did by
night, because they were greatly afraid. This Luke also mentions;2590 but this is not the same
occasion, but a different one. And the other disciples followed, because they were henceforth
bound to one another, and at the same time desired to see the fishing, and to bestow2591
their leisure well. As they then were laboring and wearied, Jesus presenteth Himself before
them, and doth not at once reveal Himself, so that they enter into converse with Him. He
therefore saith to them,

<l>Ver. 5. “Have ye2592 any meat2593 ?”</l>

<p>For a time He speaketh rather after a human manner, as if about to buy somewhat of
them. But when they made signs that they had none, He bade them cast their nets to the
right; and on casting they obtained a haul.2594 But when they recognized Him, the disciples
Peter and John again exhibited the peculiarities of their several tempers. The one was more
fervent, the other more lofty; the one more keen, the other more clear-sighted. On this account
John first recognized Jesus, Peter first came to Him.2595 For no ordinary signs were

laid thereon, and bread.2597 For He no longer made things out of matter already subsisting,
as, through a certain dispensation, He did before the Crucifixion. When therefore Peter
knew Him, he threw down all, both fish and nets, and girded himself. Seest thou his respect
and love? Yet they were only two hundred cubits off; but not even so could Peter wait to go
to Him in the boat, but reached the shore by swimming. What then doth Jesus?</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Come,” He saith, “dine.” “And none of them durst ask Him.”2598</p>
<p>For they no longer had the same boldness, nor were they so confident, nor did they now
approach Him with speech, but with silence and great fear and reverence, sat down giving
heed to Him.</p>
<p>“For they knew that2599 it was the Lord.”</p>
<p>And therefore they did not ask Him, “Who art Thou?” But seeing that His form was
altered, and full of much awfulness, they were greatly amazed, and desired to ask somewhat
concerning it; but fear, and their knowledge that He was not some other, but the Same,
checked the enquiry, and they only ate what He created for them2600 with a greater exertion
of power than before. For here He no more looketh to heaven, nor performeth those human
acts, showing that those also which He did were done by way of condescension. And to
show that He remained not with them continually, nor in like manner as before, It saith
that,
<lg>
<l>Ver. 14. “This was the third time that Jesus appeared to them,2601 after that He arose
from the dead.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And He biddeth them “to bring of the fish,” to show that what they saw was no appearance.
But here indeed it saith not that He ate with them, but Luke, in another place, saith
that He did; for “He was eating together with them.”2602 ( Acts i. 4.) But the, “how,” it is

not ours to say; for these things came to pass in too strange a manner, not as though His
nature now needed food, but from an act of condescension, in proof of the Resurrection.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Perhaps when ye heard these things, ye glowed, and called those happy who were
then with Him, and those who shall be with Him at the day of the general Resurrection. Let
us then use every exertion that we may see that admirable Face. For if when now we hear
we so burn, and desire to have been in those days which He spent upon earth, and to have
heard His Voice, and seen His face, and to have approached, and touched, and ministered
unto Him; consider how great a thing it is to see Him no longer in a mortal body, nor doing
human actions, but with a body guard of Angels, being ourselves also in a form of unmixed
purity, and beholding Him, and enjoying the rest of that bliss which passes all language.
Wherefore, I entreat, let us use every means, so as not to miss such glory. For nothing is
difficult if we be willing, nothing burdensome if we give heed. “If we endure, we shall also
reign with Him.” ( 2 Tim. ii. 12.) What then is, “If we endure”? If we bear tribulations, if
persecutions, if we walk in the strait way. For the strait way is by its nature laborious, but
by our will it is rendered light, from the hope of things to come. “For our present light affliction
worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at
the things which are seen, but at those which are not seen.” ( 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18.) Let us then
transfer our eyes to heaven, and continually imagine “those” things, and behold them. For
if we always spend our time with them, we shall not be moved to desire the pleasures of this
world, nor find it hard to bear its sorrows; but we shall laugh at these and the like, and
nothing will be able to enslave or lift us up, if only we direct our longing thither,2603 and
look to that love.2604 And why say I that we shall not grieve at present troubles? We shall
henceforth not even appear to see them. Such a thing is strong desire.2605 Those, for instance,
who are not at present with us, but being absent are loved, we image every day. For mighty
is the sovereignty of love,2606 it alienates the soul from all things else, and chains to the desired
object. If thus we love Christ, all things here will seem to be a shadow, an image, a
dream. We too shall say, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
or distress?” ( Rom. viii. 35.) He said not, “money, or wealth, or beauty,” (these are very
mean and contemptible,) but he hath put the things which seem to be grievous, famines,
persecutions, deaths. He then spat on these even, as being nought; but we for the sake of
money separate ourselves from our life, and cut ourselves off from the light. And Paul indeed
prefers “neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor any other
creature,” to the love which is towards Him; but we, if we see a little portion of gold, are

fired, and trample on His laws. And if these things are intolerable when spoken of, much
more are they so when done.2607 For the terrible thing is this, that we shudder to hear, but
do not shudder to do: we swear readily, and perjure ourselves, and plunder, and exact usury,
care nothing for sobriety, desist from exactness in prayer, transgress most of the commandments,
and for the sake of money make no account of our own members.2608 For he that
loves wealth will work ten thousand mischiefs to his neighbor, and to himself as well. He
will easily be angry with him, and revile him, and call him fool, and swear and perjure
himself, and does not2609 even preserve the measures of the old law. For he that loves gold
will not love his neighbor; yet we, for the Kingdom’s sake, are bidden to love even our enemies.
Now if by fulfilling the old commandments, we shall not be able to enter the Kingdom
of heaven, unless our righteousness exceed and go beyond them, when we transgress even
these, what excuse shall we obtain? He that loves money, not only will not love his enemies,
but will even treat his friends as enemies.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But why speak I of friends? the lovers of money have often ignored nature itself.
Such a one knows not kindred, remembers not companionship, reverences not age, has no
friend, but will be ill-disposed towards all, and above all others to himself, not only by destroying
his soul, but by racking himself with ten thousand cares, and toils, and sorrows. For
he will endure foreign travels, hatreds, dangers, plots, anything whatever, only that he may
have in his house the root of all evil, and may count much gold. What then can be more
grievous than this disease? It is void of any luxury or pleasure, for the sake of which men
often sin, it is void of honor or glory. For the lover of money suspects that he has tens of
thousands, and really has many, who accuse, and envy, and slander, and plot against him.
Those whom he has wronged hate him as having been ill-used; those who have not yet
suffered, fearing least they may suffer, and sympathizing with those who have, manifest the
same hostility; while the greater and more powerful, being stung and indignant on account
of the humbler sort, and at the same time also envying him, are his enemies and haters. And
why speak I of men? For when one hath God also made his enemy, what hope shall there
then be for him? what consolation? what comfort? He that loves riches will2610 never be
able to use them; he will be their slave and keeper, not their master. For, being ever anxious
to make them more, he will never be willing to spend them; but he will cut short himself,
and be in poorer state than any poor man, as nowhere stopping in his desire. Yet riches are
made not that we should keep, but that we should use them; but if we are going to bury
them for others, what can be more miserable than we, who run about desiring to get together

the possessions of all men,2611 that we may shut them up within, and cut them off from
common use? But there is another malady not less than this. Some men bury their money
in the earth, others in their bellies, and in pleasure and drunkenness; together with injustice
adding to themselves the punishment of wantonness. Some minister with their substance
to parasites and flatterers, others to dice and harlots, others to different expenses of the same
kind, cutting out for themselves ten thousand roads that lead to hell, but leaving the right
and sanctioned road which leads to heaven. And yet it hath not greater gain only, but
greater pleasure than the things we have mentioned. For he who gives to harlots is ridiculous
and shameful, and will have many quarrels, and brief pleasure; or rather, not even brief,
because, give what he will to the women his mistresses, they will not thank him for it; for,
“The house of a stranger is a cask with holes.” ( Prov. xxiii. 27 , LXX.) Besides, that sort of
persons is impudent,2612 and Solomon hath compared their love to the grave; and then only
do they stop, when they see their lover stripped of all. Or rather, such a woman doth not
stop even then, but tricks herself out the more, and tramples on him when he is down, and
excites much laughter against him, and works him so much mischief, as it is not possible
even to describe by words. Not such is the pleasure of the saved; for neither hath any there
a rival, but all rejoice and are glad, both they that receive blessings, and they that look on.
No anger, no despondency, no shame, no disgrace, besiege the soul of such a one, but great
is the gladness of his conscience, and great his hope of things to come; bright his glory, and
great his distinction; and more than all is the favor and safety which is from God, and not
one precipice, nor suspicion, but a waveless harbor, and calm. Considering therefore all
these things, and comparing pleasure with pleasure, let us choose the better,2613 that we
may obtain the good things to come, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXVIII.</head>
<p>John xxi. 15</p>
<p>“So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more
than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> There are indeed many other things which are able to give us boldness towards
God, and to show us bright and approved, but that which most of all brings good will from
on high, is tender care for our neighbor. Which therefore Christ requireth of Peter. For
when their eating was ended, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee.”</p>
<p>“He saith unto him, Feed My sheep.”2614</p>
<p>And why, having passed by the others, doth He speak with Peter on these matters? He
was the chosen one of the Apostles, the mouth of the disciples, the leader of the band; on
this account also Paul went up upon a time to enquire of him rather than the others. And
at the same time to show him that he must now be of good cheer, since the denial was done
away,2615 Jesus putteth into his hands the chief authority2616 among the brethren; and He
bringeth not forward the denial, nor reproacheth him with what had taken place, but saith,
“If thou lovest Me, preside over thy brethren, and the warm love which thou didst ever
manifest, and in which thou didst rejoice, show thou now; and the life which thou saidst
thou wouldest lay down for Me, now give for My sheep.”</p>
<p>When then having been asked once and again, he called Him to witness who knoweth
the secrets of the heart,2617 and then was asked even a third time,2618 he was troubled,
fearing a repetition of what had happened before, (for then, having been strong in assertion,
he was afterwards convicted,) and therefore he again betaketh himself to Him. For the saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 17. “Thou knowest all things,” meaneth, “things present, and things to come.” Seest
thou how he had become better and more sober, being no more self-willed, or contradicting?
For on this account he was troubled, “lest perchance I think that I love, and love not, as before
when I thought and affirmed much, yet I was convicted at last.” But Jesus asketh him the
<note type="footnote">2614 “My lambs,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2615 lit. “driven away.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2616 προστασίαν</note>
<note type="footnote">2617 Ver. 16. “He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto
Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2618 Ver. 17. “He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved because
He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou Me; and he said unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou
knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. ” N.T.</note>

<pb n="646"/>
third time, and the third time giveth him the same injunction, to show at what a price He
setteth the care2619 of His own sheep, and that this especially is a sign of love towards Him.
And having spoken to him concerning the love towards Himself, He foretelleth to him the
martyrdom which he should undergo, showing that He said not to Him what he said as
distrusting, but as greatly trusting him; wishing besides to point out a proof of love towards
Him, and to instruct us in what manner especially we ought to love Him. Wherefore He
saith,</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest; but when thou art old, others shall gird thee,2620 and carry thee whither thou
willest not.”</p>
<p>And yet this he did will, and desired; on which account also He hath revealed it to him.
For since Peter had continually said, “I will lay down my life for Thee” ( c. xiii. 37 ), and,
“Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee” ( Matt. xxvi. 35 ): He hath given
him back2621 his desire. What then is the, “Whither thou willest not”? He speaketh of natural
feeling, and the necessity of2622 the flesh, and that the soul is unwillingly torn away
from the body. So that even though the will were firm, yet still even then nature would be
found in fault. For no one lays aside the body without feeling, God, as I said before, having
suitably ordained this, that violent deaths might not be many. For if, as things are, the devil
has been able to effect this, and has led ten thousand to precipices and pits; had not the soul
felt such a desire for the body, the many would have rushed to this under any common
discouragement. The, “whither thou willest not,” is then the expression of one signifying
natural feeling.</p>
<p>But how after having said, “When thou wast young,” doth He again say, “When thou
art old”? For this is the expression of one declaring that he was not then young; (nor was
he; nor yet old, but a man of middle age.2623 ) Wherefore then did He recall to his memory
his former life? Signifying, that this is the nature of what belongeth to Him. In things of this
life the young man is useful, the old useless; “but in Mine,” He saith, “not so; but when old
age hath come on, then is excellence brighter, then is manliness more illustrious, being
nothing hindered by the time of life.” This He said not to terrify, but to rouse Him; for He
knew his love, and that he long had yearned for this blessing. At the same time He declareth
the kind of death. For since Peter ever desired to be in the dangers which were for His sake,
<note type="footnote">2619 προστασίαν</note>

<note type="footnote">2622 i.e. weakness inseparable from.</note>
<note type="footnote">2623 lit. “a perfect man.”</note>

<pb n="647"/>
“Be of good cheer,” He saith, “I will so satisfy thy desire, that, what thou sufferedst not when
young, thou must suffer when thou art old.” Then the Evangelist, to rouse the hearer, has
added,</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “This spake He, signifying by what death he should glorify God.”</p>
<p>He said not, “Should die,” but, “Should glorify God,” that thou mayest learn, that to
suffer for Christ, is glory and honor to the sufferer.</p>
<p>“And when He had spoken this, He saith,2624 Follow Me.”</p>
<p>Here again He alludeth to his tender carefulness, and to his being very closely attached
to Himself. And if any should say, “How then did James receive the chair at Jerusalem?” I
would make this reply, that He appointed Peter2625 teacher, not of the chair, but of the
world.</p>
<p>Ver. 20, 21. “Then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following;
who also leaned on His breast at supper; and saith,2626 Lord, and what shall this man do?”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Wherefore hath he reminded us of that reclining? Not without cause or in a chance
way, but to show us what boldness Peter had after the denial. For he who then did not dare
to question Jesus, but committed the office to another, was even entrusted with the chief
authority over the brethren, and not only doth not commit to another what relates to himself,
but himself now puts a question to his Master concerning another. John is silent, but Peter
speaks. He showeth also here the love which he bare towards him; for Peter greatly loved
John, as is clear from what followed, and their close union is shown through the whole
Gospel, and in the Acts. When therefore Christ had foretold great things to him, and committed
the world to him, and spake beforehand of his martyrdom, and testified that his love
was greater than that of the others, desiring to have John also to share with him, he said,
“And what shall this man do?” “Shall he not come the same way with us?” And as at that
other time not being able himself to ask, he puts John forward, so now desiring to make
him a return, and supposing that he would desire to ask about the matters pertaining to
himself, but had not courage, he himself undertook the questioning. What then saith Christ?</p>
<p>Ver. 22. “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?”2627</p>
<p>Since he spake from strong affection, and wishing not to be torn away from him,2628
Christ, to show that however much he might love, he could not go beyond His love, saith,
“If I will that he tarry—what is that to thee?” By these words teaching us not to be impatient,
nor curious beyond what seemeth good to Him. For because Peter was ever hot, and
<note type="footnote">2624 “saith unto him,” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2625 lit. “this man.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2626 “at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth Thee? Peter seeing him saith.” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2627 “to thee? Follow thou Me.” N.T.</note>
<note type="footnote">2628 i.e. St. John.</note>

<pb n="648"/>
springing forward to enquiries such as this, to cut short his warmth, and to teach him not
to enquire farther, He saith this.</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should
not die; yet Jesus said not2629 that he shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what
is that to thee?”</p>
<p>“Do not thou on any account suppose,” He saith, “that I order your matters after a single
rule.” And this He did to withdraw them from2630 their unseasonable sympathy for each
other; for since they were about to receive the charge of the world, it was necessary that they
should no longer be closely associated together; for assuredly this would have been a great
loss to the world. Wherefore He saith unto him, “Thou hast had a work entrusted to thee,
look to it, accomplish it, labor and struggle. What if I will that he tarry here? Look thou to
and care for thine own matters.” And observe, I pray thee, here also the absence of pride in
the Evangelist; for having mentioned the opinion of the disciples, he corrects it, as though
they had not comprehended what Jesus meant. “Jesus said not,” he tells us, “that ‘he shall
not die, but, If I will that he tarry.’”</p>
<p>Ver. 24. “This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and
we know that his testimony is true.”</p>
<p>Why is it, that then, when none of the others do so, he alone uses these words, and that
for the second time, witnessing to himself? for it seems to be offensive to the hearers. What
then is the cause? He is said to have been the last who came to writing, Christ2631 having
moved and roused him to the work; and on this account he continually sets forth his love,
alluding to the cause by which he was impelled to write. Therefore also he continually makes
mention of it, to make his record trustworthy, and to show, that, moved from thence,2632
he came to this work. “And I know,” he saith, “that the things are true which he saith. And
if the many believe not, it is permitted them to believe from this.” “From what?” From that
which is said next.</p>
<p>Ver. 25. “There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should
be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that
should be written.”</p>
<p>“Whence it is clear that I could not have written to court favor; for I who, when the
miracles were so many, have not even related so many as the others have, but omitting most
of them, have brought forward the plots of the Jews, the stonings, the hatred, the insults,
the revilings, and have shown how they called Him a demoniac and a deceiver, certainly

<note type="footnote">2630 al. “on account of.”</note>

<pb n="649"/>
could not have acted to gain favor. For it behooved one who courted favor to do the contrary,
to reject 2633 the reproachful, to set forth the glorious.” Since then he wrote what he did
from full assurance, he does not decline to produce his own testimony, challenging men
separately to enquire into and scrutinize the circumstances. For it is a custom with us, when
we think that we are speaking exactly true, never to refuse our testimony; and if we do this,
much more would he who wrote by the Spirit. What then the other Apostles when they
preached declared, he also saith; “We are witnesses of the things spoken,2634 and the Spirit
which He hath given2635 to them that obey Him.” ( Acts v. 32.) And besides, he was present
at all, and did not desert Him even when being crucified, and had His mother entrusted to
him; all which things are signs of his love for Him, and of his knowing all things exactly.
And if he has said that so many miracles had taken place, marvel thou not, but, considering
the ineffable power of the Doer, receive with faith what is spoken. For it was as easy for Him
to do whatever He would, as it is for us to speak, or rather much easier; for it sufficed that
He should will only, and all followed.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Let us then give exact heed to the words, and let us not cease to unfold and search
them through, for it is from continual application that we get some advantage. So shall we
be able to cleanse our life, so to cut up the thorns; for such a thing is sin and worldly care,
fruitless and painful. And as the thorn whatever way it is held pricks the holder, so the things
of this life, on whatever side they be laid hold of, give pain to him who hugs and cherishes
them. Not such are spiritual things; they resemble a pearl, whichever way thou turn it, it
delights the eyes. As thus. A man hath done a deed of mercy; he not only is fed with hopes
of the future, but also is cheered by the good things here, being everywhere full of confidence,
and doing all with much boldness. He hath got the better of an evil desire; even before obtaining
the Kingdom, he hath already received the fruit here, being praised and approved,
2636 before all others,2637 by his own conscience. And every good work is of this nature; just
as conscience also punishes wicked deeds here, even before the pit. For if, after sinning, thou
considerest the future, thou becomest afraid and tremblest, though no man punish thee; if
the present, thou hast many enemies, and livest in suspicion, and canst not henceforth even
look in the face those who have wronged thee, or rather, those who have not wronged
thee.2638 For we do not in the case of those evil deeds reap so much pleasure, as we do despondency,
when conscience cries out against us, men, without, condemn us, God is angered,

<pb n="650"/>
the pit travailing to receive us, our thoughts not at rest. A heavy, a heavy and a burdensome
thing is sin, harder to bear than any lead. He at least who hath any sense of it will not be
able to look up ever so little, though he be very dull. Thus, for instance, Ahab, though very
impious, when he felt this, walked bending downwards, crushed and afflicted. On this account
he clothed himself in sackcloth, and shed fountains of tears. ( 1 Kings xxi. 27.) If we do this,
and grieve as he did, we shall put off our faults as did Zacchæus, and we too shall obtain
some pardon. ( Luke xix. 9.) For as in the case of tumors,2639 and fistulous ulcers,2640 if one
stay not first the discharge which runs over and inflames the wound, how many soever
remedies he applies, while the source of the evil is not stopped, he doth all in vain; so too if
we stay not our hand from covetousness, and check not that evil afflux of wealth, although
we give alms, we do all to no purpose. For that which was healed by it,2641 covetousness
coming after is wont to overwhelm2642 and spoil, and to make harder to heal than before.
Let us then cease from rapine, and so do alms. But if we betake ourselves to precipices, how
shall we be able to recover ourselves?2643 for if one party (that is, alms-doing) were to pull
at a falling man from above, while another was forcibly dragging him from below, the only
result of such a struggle would be, that the man would be torn asunder. That we may not
suffer this, nor, while covetousness weighs us down from below, alms-doing depart and
leave us, let us lighten ourselves, and spread our wings,2644 that having been perfected by
the riddance of evil things, and the practice of good,2645 we may obtain the goods everlasting,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
and the Holy Ghost be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>This volume completes the series of St. Chrysostom’s Homilies on the New Testament.
Translated a quarter of a century ago by the Rev. T. Keble, Vicar of Bisley, and revised with
great labor in the use of the then existing editions by his brother, the Vicar of Hursley, it
was thought best to delay the publication until Dr. Field had completed the long-delayed
publication of the Greek Text. This appeared in 1862.</p>
<p>The editing of the text of St. Chrysostom’s Homilies is attended with peculiar difficulties.
Written sermons,2646 if ever preached in those days, were the exception. Those which have
been preserved to us have been generally taken down by some hearer. St. Augustine afterwards
revised his, when brought to him for the purpose. In the case of St. Chrysostom’s
Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles, as well as of the present volume, there are two distinct
text still extant: that originally taken down by the short-hand writer, and another, when this
had been polished and made neat at a subsequent time. Dr. Field’s great labor then in the
Greek Text of the present volume had been to restore the older form of these Homilies. He
had ample material, both in Greek mss., in a Catena published not many years ago by our
Dr. Cramer, Principal of New Inn Hall, which exhibit the older text (the former half of a
second Catena, compiled by Niketas,2647 Archbishop of Heraclea in Thrace in the eleventh
century, and published by the same Dr. Cramer, appears to use both); and, of yet more importance,
in Latin versions.</p>
<p>Cassiodorus, an Italian, who lived about 150 years after St. Chrysostom, in the earlier
part of his treatise, de Institutione Divinarum Litterarum, cap. 8 (opp. t. ii. p. 543, ed. Rotom.
1679) in describing a volume of St. Paul’s Epistles, in which 13 of the Epistles had a good
commentary, goes on, “But in regard to the Epistle to the Hebrews which St. John Bishop

De Ador. viii. t. i. 267. See also the constantly occurring expressions in St. Augustine, which belong to the
natural extemporaneous delivery, but which would be untrue in the delivery of written sermons. The Preface
to the first volume of St. Augustin on St. John, in this Library, written by the Rev. H. Browne, contains
interesting details of St. Augustine’s preaching. Fleury remarks of Atticus, Archbishop of Constantinople, in
the beginning of the fifth century, just after St. Chrysostom’s decease, “His sermons were indifferent, so that
no one took the trouble to take them down in writing.” Fleury, Eccles. Hist. xxii. 9, p. 133, Oxford translation.
The extract, however, which St. Cyril has preserved of Atticus (de recta fide ad Arcadiam Marinamque, repeated
in his Apol. adv. Episcopos Orientales, cap. 4) is eloquent and pious.</note>

of Constantinople treated of in Greek in 34 homilies, we have caused Mutianus, a most
eloquent man, to translate them into Latin, that the order of the Epistles might not be unduly
broken off.”</p>
<p>To Cassiodorus then we own the Latin version of Mutianus which has come down to
us, and which, translated from the older form of text, has been a great assistance in the
editing. It is often quoted in the foot-notes. In p. 167 there is also given an extract from the
13th Homily by Facundus, an African Bishop, who lived about the same time with Mutianus,
but who apparently translated the passage into Latin for himself.</p>
<p>The short-hand writer, who took down these Homilies and thus preserved them to us,
is not unknown to us. It is St. Chrysostom’s dearly-loved friend the Priest Constantine or
Constantius.2648 For the title is, “Homilies of St. John Chrysostom Archbishop of Constantinople
on the Epistle to the Hebrews, published after his decease, from notes by Constantine,
Presbyter of Antioch.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of St. Chrysostom’s exile in 404, when he was in Nicæa, in a Letter
which he wrote to Constantius about a mission which he had set on foot at Phoenicia (Ep.
121 t. iii. pp. 721, 722, ed. Montf.), he begs him “not to cease having a care for the Churches
of Phoenicia and Arabia and the east, and to write to” St. Chrysostom “quite often, and tell
him how many Churches had been built in a year and what holy men had gone into
Phoenicia.” Soon after, Constantius seems to have asked leave of St. Chrysostom to join him;
for in his 13th letter to Olympias on arriving at Cocussus or Cucusus in Cappadocia, now
Goksyn, his bitter place of exile, St. Chrysostom says (ib. p. 594), “My Lord, the most pious
priest Constantius, would fain have been here long ago, for he wrote to me begging that I
would let him come.” About this time, perhaps while Constantius was on his actual journey
to Cucusus, St. Chrysostom writes to him (Ep. 225, p. 724), grieved at not having heard
from him, and speaks of their great love for each other and of Constantius’ goodness to the
poor, the fatherless and widows: soon after he writes from Cucusus to Elpidius bishop of
Laodicea (Ep. 114, p. 656), “the most reverend priests Constantius and Euethius are here
with us.” There are extant two Letters of Constantius, one of them to his mother, written
while he was companion of St. Chrysostom there (pp. 731 and 734). In the course of this
banishment St. Chrysostom writes (Ep. 123, pp. 663, 664) about this Phoenician mission to
“the priests and monks in Phoenicia, who were instructing the Gentiles there,” encouraging
them in their work, and saying that he had given orders that all their expenses “in clothing,
shoes, and support of the brethren should be bountifully supplied,” and adds that they will
know about his affairs from Constantius’ letter. In a letter to Gerontius (Ep. 54, p. 623)
written during this exile about the mission in Phoenicia, St. Chrysostom says that he had
<note type="footnote">2648 Montfaucon observes that the Manuscripts frequently interchange the name.</note>

<pb n="654"/>
intrusted Constantius to give Gerontius all he needed whether “for building or for the needs
of the brethren.”</p>
<p>To Constantius’ piety we owe the preservation of these Homilies. One very special value
of them lies in the pious fervent exhortation at the end of each, on Penitence, Almsgiving,
or whatever St. Chrysostom had at the time chiefly in mind, breathing forth words from a
heart, filled with the love of God and that longed for his flock to partake it.</p>

<p>After the publication of Dr. Field’s text (Bibliotheca Patrum Ecclesiae Catholicae Qui
ante Orientis et Occidentis schisma floruerunt, tom. vii. Oxonii 1862) the translation was
again very carefully revised by that text by the Rev. Dr. Barrow, Principal of St. Edmund
Hall: he also wrote heads for the present Preface. The headings were given (as far as could
be done) in the ms. and many of them have been retained; others, fitting in less well with
the printed page, seemed to need a little modification. For an occasional note enclosed in
brackets, the son of the one remaining Editor of the Library is responsible.</p>

<p><del>It has seemed better in this edition to conform the translation of the Scripture texts to
some one standard. St. Chrysostom used the current text of his day, which, on the whole,
was more like the Textus Receptus, the basis of the A.V., than the more critical text followed
by the R.V. It has therefore seemed best to take the A.V. as the standard (except where St.
Chrysostom has followed a different text), but note has been made of any variations of the
R.V. materially affecting the sense. There remain a number of loose quotations and combinations
of different texts, and in these the English translation is retained.</del></p>
<p>Effort has been made to simplify the language and remove involved constructions in
the translation of the Homilies. The English translation was originally made from the Benedictine,
and afterwards revised from Field’s more accurate text, and the differences between
these have sometimes been overlooked. Besides this, it has often been possible to give St.
Chrysostom’s meaning more accurately,—sometimes even reversing the sense. There are,
however, many very felicitous translations in the English edition which have been retained.
It is a revision, and not a new translation.</p>

<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>by the american reviser.</p>
<p>In the following Homilies St. Chrysostom assumes throughout St. Paul’s authorship of
the Epistle, and in his opening Homily deals with considerable ingenuity with several of the
most obvious objections to the Pauline authorship.</p>
<p>The Epistle, however, is anonymous, and is not attributed to St. Paul by the most ancient
historical testimony which has come down to us, nor is his authorship generally recognized
by modern criticism. It is interesting, therefore, to enquire whether St. Chrysostom, in adopting
the prevailing view of his time, did so on sufficient grounds.</p>
<p>The history of the matter is very curious. At the close of the second century Tertullian
speaks positively and unhesitatingly of the Epistle to the Hebrews as written by Barnabas,
the early and long-continued companion of St. Paul.2649 But there happened to be current
in the ancient Church another epistle ascribed to Barnabas, and then commonly received
as his, though generally considered spurious. The two epistles were so entirely unlike that
no one could well receive them both as from the same author. The result was different in
different parts of the Church. In the West, although the Epistle to the Hebrews had been
used very largely by Clement of Rome, it came to be discredited altogether, and did not secure
general recognition until the fourth century; it was then gradually acknowledged and attributed,
at first doubtfully, but afterwards by common consent, to St. Paul. In the East, on the
other hand, the Epistle itself was firmly accepted from the first, but with no certain tradition
and much questioning in regard to its author. The suggestion of its Pauline authorship
seems to have been made by Pantænus, the teacher of Clement of Alexandria, and a contemporary
of Tertullian. We have his opinion, however, only at third hand, in a quotation preserved
by Eusebius2650 from a lost work of Clement, and it is impossible to tell on what
grounds he rested his opinion, or whether it was a mere personal speculation, like the reason
he gives for the omission of the name of St. Paul in connection with the Epistle.</p>

‘since the Lord who was the Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, Paul by reason of his inferiority,
as if sent to the Gentiles, did not subscribe himself an apostle of the Hebrews; both out of reverence for the
Lord, and because he wrote of his abundance to the Hebrews, as a herald and apostle of the Gentiles.’”</note>

<pb n="657"/>
<p>His disciple Clement adopted the suggestion not without hesitation. No one familiar
with Greek, which was still the current language of the East, and especially of Alexandria,
could fail to be struck by the extreme difference of style between this Epistle and those of
St. Paul. Clement, therefore, conjectured that it might have been originally written by St.
Paul in Hebrew and translated into Greek by St. Luke. This again is second-hand opinion
preserved to us by Eusebius.2651 Nevertheless, in other works, which are still extant, he frequently
cites the Epistle as St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>Clement was succeeded in his catechetical office at Alexandria by Origen, a profound
thinker and scholar. He was strongly impressed with the difference between the Greek of
this and of the Pauline Epistles, and speaks of the matter in different parts of his voluminous
works, sometimes suggesting the Clementine hypothesis, sometimes speaking of the variety
of opinions and traditions on the subject, sometimes speaking of St. Luke or of Clement of
Rome as the probable author, but summing up his perplexity (in language, quoted fully by
Eusebius), by saying that who really was the author, God only knows.2652</p>
<p>Thus far the question of authorship was evidently an open one on which everyone was
free to hold his own opinion, or uncertainty of opinion. Tertullian speaks of the authorship
of Barnabas simply as a fact, without an allusion to any doubt on the matter. But as the time
went on, the attention of the masters of thought in the Church became more and more engrossed
with doctrinal questions, while those of exegesis and criticism more and more lost
their interest, especially in the East. In the West there is no trace of any reference of the authorship
of the Epistle to St. Paul until the middle of the fourth century; but after this the
opinion spread rapidly, and under the influence of Augustine, in the year 393 somewhat
hesitatingly, but in 419 positively, the provincial council of Carthage reckoned it among the
Pauline Epistles. Augustine himself, however, sometimes expressed himself doubtfully, and
although it had now become customary to quote the Epistle as St. Paul’s, yet scholars like
Jerome, when distinctly treating of the question, express the old doubts and uncertainties
of Origen. The assumption of the Pauline authorship was a convenience in maintaining the
authority of the Epistle, and there being almost no one to call it in question, had come to
be generally adopted in St. Chrysostom’s time, and remained almost unquestioned until the
<note type="footnote">2651 Ibid . The Epistle to the Hebrews he asserts was written by Paul to the Hebrews in the Hebrew tongue,
but that it was carefully translated by Luke and published among the Greeks. Therefore one finds the same
character of style and of phraseology in the Epistle as in the Acts. “But it is probable that the title, Paul the
Apostle, was not prefixed to it. For as he wrote to the Hebrews, who had imbibed prejudices against him and
suspected him, he wisely guards against diverting them from the perusal by giving his name.”</note>

<pb n="658"/>
revival of learning at the period of the Reformation. Since then, while still remaining a
popular impression, it has come to be rejected by the great majority of careful students.</p>
<p>In this variety of opinion from the earliest times, and in the absence of any consistent
external evidence, we are plainly left free to form our own conclusions from internal evidence.
Among the great number of authors suggested by different writers, the only names entitled
to especial consideration are those of St. Paul (Chrysostom, Augustine, and later writers
generally until modern times, but at present the only scholar of weight is Hofmann), St.
Luke (besides the views of ancients given above, Calvin, Ebrard, Döllinger, and to a certain
extent Delitzsch), Clement of Rome (Erasmus, Reithmaier, Bisping), Silas (Mynster, Böhme,
Godet), Apollos (Luther, Semler, De Wette, Tholuck, Bunsen, Kurtz, Farrar, De Pressensé,
Bleek, Hilgenfeld, Lünemann, Alford), and Barnabas (Ullmann, Wieseler, Ritschl, Grau,
Thiersch, Weiss, Renan, Keil). Of the three first we have genuine writings with which to
make a comparison; of the three last—assuming the spuriousness of the so-called Epistles
of Barnabas—nothing remains.</p>
<p>The supposition of the authorship of St. Paul, although so long carelessly held, seems
almost forbidden by an expression in the Epistle itself. St. Paul was always most strenuous
in asserting that he had received his apostleship and his knowledge of the truth “not of man,
neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father” ( Gal. i. 1 ), while the author of
this Epistle ranks himself among those who had received through the medium of others
that Gospel “which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us
by them that heard Him” ( ii. 3 ). All attempts to weaken the force of this evidence by considering
the passage as merely an instance of the rhetorical figure koinosis, in which the
writer identifies himself with his readers, and thus attributes to himself what properly belongs
only to them, have been unsuccessful. Delitzsch considers that if the Epistle were the joint
work of St. Paul and St. Luke, in which the former only supplied the general course of
thought, leaving its expression entirely to the latter, even this expression, so singularly like
Luke i. 1, 2 , might have been used; but this can only be by a practical surrender of the Pauline
authorship. St. Paul everywhere lays such emphasis on the fact that his presentation of
Christian truth was in no way whatever derived from man, but was from express divine instruction
given to himself personally, that this passage must form a presumption against
the Pauline authorship so strong as to be set aside only by clear and positive evidence. It has
already appeared that there is no such external evidence; the internal will be examined below.</p>
<p>The authorship of Clement of Rome may also be set aside on two grounds: (1) That he
quotes largely from this Epistle with the whole air of one citing from a higher authority to
confirm his own teachings; and (2) that his own manner and style, as well as intellectual
power, is so unlike as to make the supposition of a common authorship scarcely conceivable.</p>
<p>The early suggestion that the Epistle may have been written in Hebrew by St. Paul, more
or less fully, and translated by St. Luke or St. Clement, or some other of his companions

<pb n="659"/>
more or less paraphrastically, can find no favor with the modern scholar. If such a supposition
is meant to leave the work essentially a translation, it encounters all the difficulties already
mentioned against the Pauline authorship, and besides is opposed to abundant evidence
that the work was originally written in Greek. “It abounds in compound words which are
essentially Greek, which have no analogues in Aramaic or in Hebrew,”2653 and it contains
paronomasia, entering into the thought, which could only be possible in Greek. If, on the
other hand, it is meant to express merely some connection of St. Paul with the thought and
line of argument of the Epistle, it really gives up the Pauline authorship, and even this thread
of connection may be found in the sequel difficult to retain.</p>
<p>In favor of the authorship of St. Paul so far as the ideas and essential argument of the
Epistle are concerned, Origen urges the beauty of the thoughts, and there must be some
force in this argument, or the Epistle could hardly have been so long and so widely attributed
to him. Perhaps it may be summed up in the words of an eminent and now departed divine,
2654 “If the Epistle were not written by St. Paul, then we have the remarkable phenomenon
that there were two men among the Christians of that age who were capable of writing
it.” The theory has also a certain primâ facie probability, and offers a convenient way of reconciling
the conflict of the external evidence. But of course it cannot be accepted merely
on these grounds.</p>
<p>At the outset, on a general view of the Epistle, every one must be struck with the marked
difference in its construction from any of St. Paul’s Epistles. The omission of his name at
the beginning has been more or less satisfactorily accounted for from ancient times, but the
reasons for this do not apply to the absence of any sort of salutation, “any heading or introductory
thanksgiving,” by which St. Paul always takes pains to conciliate his readers, and
of which there was especial need if he were writing to Hebrews disposed to prejudice against
him. On the contrary, after the manner of St. Mark in his Gospel, the writer strikes directly
into his subject, without any sort of preface. Another striking feature of difference is, that
St. Paul always keeps close to his argument until it is complete, and then adds practical exhortations
founded upon it, while in our Epistle each short division of the argument is separated
from that which follows by its appropriate practical application. This indicates quite
a different habit of mind, and it is difficult to fancy such a severely logical reasoner as St.
Paul thus pausing in the flow of his argument. The style of the Epistle is so markedly different
from that of St. Paul that attention has been drawn to this point from the time of Origen
down. The “rounded oratorical periods” of the Hebrews are very unlike the “unstudied,
broken, abrupt phraseology” of St. Paul. This difference might, in part at least, be accounted
for as the work of the translator; only in that case, the translator could have been neither St.
<note type="footnote">2653 Godet in The Expositor, April, 1888, p. 262.</note>
<note type="footnote">2654 Bp. George Burgess.</note>

<pb n="660"/>
Luke, whose style is clear and smooth enough, but not at all oratorical, nor Clement, whose
style is very unlike.</p>
<p>When we come to details, there are two passages which have been thought to favor a
Pauline authorship. There is a quotation in Heb. x. 30 , which, it is alleged, agrees precisely
with the same quotation in Rom. xii. 19 , but differs from either the Hebrew or the Greek
of Deut. xxxii. 35. The A.V. makes a slight variation in language between Romans and
Hebrews, but the Textus Receptus of the original is the same: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense,
saith the Lord.” Now the LXX reads, “In the day of vengeance I will recompense”;
the Hebrew, “mine [are] vengeance and recompense.” If, however, we examine any critical
text, we shall find that the clause “saith the Lord,” is rejected as a gloss in this Epistle, while
undisputed in Romans, thus constituting a difference between them. It is still true, however,
that they both differ in the same way from the Hebrew and the LXX. This might be a difficulty
were it not that the quotation as it is in this Epistle is found exactly in the Targum, and from
that had probably passed into familiar use. Everywhere else the author of Hebrews quotes
very closely from the LXX, and from that in what is known as its Alexandrine form, while
St. Paul uses the Vatican text, quotes far more loosely, and often follows the Hebrew rather
than the Greek.</p>
<p>The other passage really gives no clear indication at all, and as far as it goes, is rather at
variance with Pauline authorship. In xii. 23 the writer says, “Know ye that our brother
Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, (if he come shortly,) I will see you.” It is of course
possible that Timothy may have been imprisoned, at Rome or elsewhere, when St. Paul was
with him; but as far as we know the history of the two, it seems unlikely. The passage might
quite as well have been written by almost any of the companions of St. Paul who were also
associated with Timothy.</p>
<p>When now, enquiry is made as to the indications to be found in the choice of words
and construction of sentences, there is certainly room for some difference of opinion. Delitzsch
has endeavored throughout his commentary on this Epistle to show that there is such
a striking similarity between it and the writings of St. Luke as to favor decidedly the view
that it was written by him; Lünemann, on the other hand, in the introduction to his commentary,
has collected the instances of Delitzsch and remarks upon them, “So soon as we
separate therefrom that which is not exclusively peculiar to Luke and the Epistle to the
Hebrews; so soon as we also put out of the account that which Luke has only taken up out
of the sources employed by him, and cease to lay any weight upon isolated expressions and
turns of discourse which were the common property either of the Greek language in general,
or of the later Greek in particular, and are only accidentally present in Luke and the Epistle
to the Hebrews,—there is nothing whatever left of an actual affinity, such as must of necessity
admit of being traced out between the works of the same author.” The fact seems to be that
there is between these two writers as compared with the other New Testament writers a

<pb n="661"/>
certain similarity, not so much of particular words and constructions, as of the general cast,
both of the phraseology and the structure of the sentences; but that this similarity arises,
not from the identity of the writers, but from the fact that both wrote in somewhat better
Greek than is found in the rest of the New Testament. The grammars of the New Testament
Greek continually refer to the fact, that certain classical constructions are found only, or at
least more frequently, in these writers than elsewhere. But this does not prove more than
that the author of this Epistle, as might easily have been the case with several of the companions
of St. Paul, like St. Luke, was more accustomed to classical Greek usage than most of
the earliest Christian writers.</p>
<p>An examination of the vocabulary of this Epistle in comparison with that of St. Paul,
St. Luke, and the other New Testament writers will throw some light upon the question. In
another place2655 I have made such an examination with some care, and will here give a
summary of its results. It is to be borne in mind that this Epistle is much shorter than the
collective writings of St. Paul, or St. Luke, or of the other New Testament writers taken to-
gether. By a careful estimate of the actual length of these four groups it is found that, taking
the longest as the standard, in order to determine the relative use of any word in them, it is
necessary to multiply the number of its occurrences in St. Luke by 1.57, in St. Paul by 1.86,
in Hebrews by 11.56. The results may in many instances prove fallacious. Any writer may
use a word several times, even in a short passage, which he would not have used again had
his writing been greatly extended; or he may not use a particular word once in twenty pages,
when he will employ it several times in the twenty-first. Such facts must be borne in mind,
but the above process seems to be the only means of making a comparative statement in
figures; and when it is applied to a large number of words, and especially to whole groups
of words which correspond to certain classes of ideas, the general result must have a decided
bearing upon the question of authorship.</p>
<p>It has often been noticed that the number of words peculiar to any New Testament
writer is an index of the number freely at his command. Peculiar words, it is true, are often
required by peculiarity of subject, and may sometimes be what is called accidental. Still,
when the number of them in any writer is unusually large, the fact has its value, and such
words do abound in the writings of St. Luke and in the Epistle to the Hebrews above all
others. 2656 No great importance perhaps should be attached to this point; yet as it is often
brought forward, the exact facts should be ascertained. Excluding words occurring only in
quotations from the LXX (which can have no bearing upon the characteristics of the writer),

in the New Testament only in the Gospel of St. Luke is 249, in the Acts 414, in both taken
together 724; the similar number in the much shorter Epistle to the Hebrews is 147, while
even the Apocalypse, with all its peculiar subjects and imagery, has but 116, and none of
the other books (except Matthew 114) reach as high as 100. This suggests that the writer of
this Epistle was like St. Luke in having at his command a peculiarly rich vocabulary. But if
the facts be looked at in another way, and the comparative length of the various books taken
into consideration, a different result is reached. St. Luke’s Gospel has one peculiar word to
every 9.76 lines; Acts, one to every 5.77; Hebrews, one to 4.45; but 1 Timothy has one to
every three lines; 2 Timothy, one to 3.22; Titus, one to 2.97; James, one to 3.5; and so on
with several of the shorter epistles. The result of such statistics appears to depend much
upon how they are manipulated. Nevertheless, in no book of nearly equal, or of greater
length, is the proportion so large as in this Epistle, except in the Acts. If the writings of
various authors be taken collectively,—
<lg>
<l>St. Luke has 724 peculiar words = 1 to every 6.66 lines.</l>
<l>St. Paul has 777 peculiar words = 1 to every 5.25 lines.</l>
<l>Hebrews has 147 peculiar words = 1 to every 4.45 lines.</l>
<l>St. John has 244 peculiar words = 1 to every 13.46 lines.</l>
<l>All others taken together have 378 peculiar words = 1 to every 11.38 lines.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>On the whole, then, the first impression of every reader is confirmed: St. Paul, St. Luke,
and the author of Hebrews are alike distinguished from the other New Testament writers
by the comparative richness of their vocabulary; yet, in view of the peculiar subjects treated
in this Epistle, this fact has less significance than it might be entitled to under other circumstances.</p>
<p>Another question may be asked of the same kind. May not some indication of authorship
be found in the number and character of the words common only to the Hebrews with St.
Paul, with St. Luke, and with the other writers respectively? There are 34 words common
to St. Luke and Hebrews, and found nowhere else; to St. Paul and Hebrews, 46; to all others
and Hebrews, 28. Or, proportioning these numbers to the length of the several books,
common to Luke and Hebrews, 53.5; to St. Paul and Hebrews, 85.56; to other writers and
Hebrews, 28; or nearly twice as many common to Hebrews with St. Luke, and more than
three times as many common to Hebrews with St. Paul, as there are common to Hebrews
with other writers. This examination tends like the other, but much more strongly, to connect
this Epistle both with St. Luke and St. Paul, but especially with the latter. It falls in with the
vacillating opinion of Origen, already given, and with his report of the current traditions of
his time.</p>
<p>But much more important than the mere numerical statement, is the character of some
of these words, used in common by these writers and by no others. Most of them, indeed,
have nothing characteristic, and many are used but once by each of the writers, and that

<pb n="663"/>
apparently without any special design. There are several, however, worthy of more consideration.
The noun καταπαύσις and the verb καταπαύω , which might be expected to be
common enough, are used only in Luke and Hebrews, the noun once in Luke, eight times
in Hebrews; the verb 11 times in Luke, three times in Hebrews; or together, 12 times and
11 times. The noun μέτοχος is used once in Luke, five times in Hebrews, and nowhere else,
while the verb μετέχω is used five times by St. Paul, three times in Hebrews, and by no other
writer. Διατίθεμαι occurs three times in Luke, twice in Hebrews, and nowhere else. Συναντάω
is used four times in Luke, twice in Hebrews, and not elsewhere. The word for star in Greek
has either form, ἄ στρον or ἀ στήρ, and both are common in the LXX; but the former is
used exclusively by St. Luke (three times) and also in Hebrews, where, however, it occurs
but once; but ἀ στήρ is used exclusively by all the other New Testament writers, by St. Paul
three times, by others 21 times. On the other hand, ἐ νδείκνυμι occurs twice in Hebrews,
nine times in St. Paul, and in no other writer. The verb εὐαρεστέω (occurring three times)
is peculiar to Hebrews, as is also the adverb εὐαρέστεως, while the adjective εὐάρεστος occurs
once in Hebrews, and seven times in St. Paul, being found nowhere else in the New Testament.
The striking adverb ἐ φάπαξ, not found in any other New Testament writer, occurs
three times in Hebrews and twice in St. Paul. The verb λειτουγέω with the nouns λειτουγία
and λειτουργός and the adjective λειτουργικός, though common enough in the LXX, and
apparently sufficiently often called for, are used in the New Testament only by St. Luke, St.
Paul, and in Hebrews. The verb occurs once in each of them; λειτουργία is used once by St.
Luke, three times by St. Paul, twice in Hebrews; λειτουργός three times by St. Paul, twice
in Hebrews; while the adjective occurs only once in the last; i.e. taking the whole group together,
it is employed twice by St. Luke, seven times by St. Paul, and six times in Hebrews,
and never elsewhere. The much more important word μεσίτης is used only in St. Paul and
Hebrews, three times in each. The same is true of ὁ μολογία, a word which might have been
expected more frequently. There seems to be nothing peculiar about ὀ νειδίσμος which yet
happens to be found only in St. Paul (three times) and in Hebrews (twice). The words παιδεία
and παιδευτής also occur only in these writers, the former four times, the latter once in St.
Paul; the former twice, the latter once in Hebrews; or together, five times and three times.
We are surprised to find such a word as πληροφορία only in these writers, in each of them
twice. The remarkable word ὑ πόστασις, afterwards in another sense of so much importance
theologically, is found only in these writers, in St. Paul three times, in Hebrews twice.</p>
<p>The results of this comparison have a positive value, unless they can be, at least in some
good degree, paralleled by words common to Hebrews and the other New Testament writers.
I do not find this to be the case. There seem to be but two words common only to Hebrews
and to any of them occurring more than once in each. One of these is the purely accidental
word ἕ βδομος, used twice in Hebrews, and seven times elsewhere (five times in Revelation);
and the other is the more important word βαπτισμός (always in the plural = purifying

<pb n="664"/>
ablutions) used twice each in Mark and Hebrews. Whatever value, therefore, there may be
in this examination of common words, it is much increased by the almost entire absence of
any such relation between this Epistle and the other writings of the New Testament. It certainly
points, as far as it goes, to some sort of relation between the three writers, St. Luke,
St. Paul, and the author of Hebrews, and especially between the two last.</p>
<p>We now turn to common words of wider range which yet have something in their usage
tending to show the style of the writer. The verb ἔ ρχομαι with its compounds ἀ π􀀀 -, ἐ π􀀀
-, ἐ ξ -, εἰσ -, κατ -, παρ -, and προσ -, is naturally more common in narrative. Making allowance
for this, we are surprised at its relative frequency in Hebrews and infrequency in the
Pauline Epistles, while the word is in such common use as to make this difference significant.
The proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 519; St. Luke, 656; St. Paul, 169; all others, 708.
For the particular compound εἰσέρχομαι, the same numbers are: Hebrews, 196; St. Luke,
133; St. Paul, 7; all others, 91. While it is relatively much the most frequent in Hebrews, it
is yet common in St. Luke, but almost entirely avoided by St. Paul.</p>
<p>Λαμβάνω with its compounds ἐ πι -, παρα -, and ὑ πο -, have a similar variable usage.
They are all relatively much more frequent in Hebrews than elsewhere, less common in St.
Luke, and still less so in St. Paul; taking the simple verb and its compounds separately, St.
Luke alone uses that with ὑ πό (four times actually, or relatively, six times), and almost entirely
avoids that with παρά, and St. Paul, like the other writers, that with ἐ πί ; while Hebrews
uses them all (except ὑ πό) with peculiar frequency. The proportionate numbers are:—

</p>
<p>While St. Matthew habitually designates heavenly things by the plural (gen. or dat.) of
οὐρανός, and is somewhat followed by the other writers, the author of Hebrews and St. Paul
employ these forms very little and are almost alone in availing themselves of the compound
adjective ἐ πουράνιος for the same purpose. St. Luke uses this word only once; Hebrews, six
times; St. Paul, twelve times; all others, twice. On the other hand, the simple οὐράνιος is not
used at all in Hebrews and St. Paul, but occurs twice in St. Luke, and four times elsewhere.</p>
<p>The words λαλεῖν and λέγειν are both common enough, and the distinction between
them is well recognized. The point to be noticed is the frequency of their use relatively to
each other. Hebrews uses them in the proportion of 1:2; St. Paul the same; St. Luke, 1:3½;
all others, 1:7 nearly. St. Luke here varies considerably from Hebrews and St. Paul, but far
less than the others.</p>
<p>The Hebraistic πρόσωπον, so frequent in the LXX, is found but once in Hebrews, and
then in an allusion to the LXX; but curiously occurs 27 times in St. Luke, as many in St.
Paul, and in all others 22. So also ῥ ῆ μα is a common enough word; but in its Hebraistic
sense, corresponding to dabar, a thing, the subject-matter of speech or command, its use is
confined to St. Luke, and it does not occur either in Hebrews or elsewhere. Both ὑ πάρχω
and ὑ ποστρέφω are favorite words with St. Luke. The former occurs in his writings 34 times,
is not found at all in Hebrews; is used by St. Paul 11 times, and only four times elsewhere;
the latter is used by St. Luke 31 times, and elsewhere only once each in Hebrews, St. Paul,
and St. Mark. Κατεργάζομαι is a Pauline word (21 times), never used in Hebrews, and but
three times elsewhere (Jas. 2, Pet. 1). On the other hand, the use of the comparatives κρείσσων
and πλείων, with the superlative πλεῖστος, is far more common in Hebrews. The comparative
numbers are: for κρείσσων, Hebrews, 150; St. Luke, ; St. Paul, 7 (he also used the adverb
κρεῖσσον once); all others, 2. For πλείων πλεῖστος, Heb., 46; St. Luke, 42; St. Paul, 19; all
others, 17.</p>
<p>I do not recall any other words of this kind, the usage of which affects our enquiry. Such
inferences as may be drawn from this examination are somewhat contradictory. They certainly
do not point to the author of this Epistle as either St. Paul or St. Luke, as they might
be expected to do if such were the fact. There are some striking similarities of diction; but
the differences are, at least, quite as important.</p>
<p>It is time now to turn to those adverbs, particles and prepositions, which bring out the
grammatical form in which a writer is accustomed to clothe his ideas. But before speaking

<pb n="666"/>
of these, mention must be made of one grammatical form peculiarly characteristic of the
nicety and subtlety of thought of the classic Greek writers—the optative mood. This subject
has been investigated by Dr. Harman with great care. He finds that this mode is used in the
whole New Testament 66 times, 32 of them in the Pauline Epistles, 28 in the writings of St.
Luke, once in Hebrews, and five times in all other writers. “In nearly all the cases in which
the optative occurs in the New Testament it is used to express a wish or prayer, except in
the writings of Luke.” “In the Epistle to the Hebrews we find one instance of the optative,
καταρτίσαι, ‘ May God make you perfect’ ( xiii. 21 ). This is presumptive proof that an Alexandrian
did not write this Epistle, as it is not likely that the use of this mode in but one
instance would have satisfied his fine Greek taste.”2657</p>
<p>The usage of the particles, adverbs and prepositions, require so much detail that only a
summary can here be given with a reference to the paper on the “Language of the Epistles
to the Hebrews,” already mentioned.</p>
<p>The particles μέν and δέ would naturally be more common in narrative; but as between
Hebrews, St. Paul, and the other Epistles, they are relatively most frequent in Hebrews. The
same is true of the conjunction τε, which is more common in St. Luke and St. Paul than in
other New Testament writers. The adversative ἀ λλά is common enough everywhere, not
even the shortest epistle being without more than one instance of its use. St. Luke and
Hebrews employ it very much more seldom; but again, St. Luke uses it far less than Hebrews.
The three writers, St. Luke, St. Paul, and the author of Hebrews, are distinguished from the
other writers by the (comparatively) sparing use of ἄ ν and ἐ ά ν , but of the three, St. Luke
employs it most, and St. Paul least. Hebrews alone uses ἐ ά νπερ, but never ἐ ά ν μή, which
is employed in St. Luke with moderate freedom, by St. Paul twice as often, and still more
frequently by the other writers. In the case of διό, St. Paul uses it relatively only half as often
as Hebrews, but three times as often as St. Luke, and the last more than twice as often as the
other writers. In the use of διότι, a much less common word, there is a less difference, but
still a marked one and in the same order.</p>
<p>The pronouns of the first and second person are used, as might be expected, most
abundantly by St. Paul; but Hebrews is singularly shy of them. This fact has been noticed
and an explanation offered on the ground that the work has more the character of a treatise
than of a personal epistle; but this explains too much, since these personal pronouns, though
relatively infrequent, are still very common in our epistle. The author was not disposed to
bring forward the personality of either himself or his hearers. St. Paul, on the contrary, used
these pronouns more than twice as often as our author, and indeed far more frequently than
any other New Testament writer.</p>
<note type="footnote">2657 “The Optative Mode in Hellenistic Greek,” by Prof. H. M. Harman, D.D., LL.D. Journal of Soc. of Bibl. Lit.
and Exegesis, Dec. 1886, p. 10.</note>

<pb n="667"/>
<p>The case of the third person of the pronoun is peculiar, since its frequent redundant
use is one of the marked characteristics of the New Testament diction; yet St. Paul uses it
less than half as often as Hebrews. The same is true of the demonstrative ἐ κεῖνος ; but in
the use of the reflective ἑ αυτός, St. Paul is largely in excess. The difference in the use of
these pronouns between Hebrews and St. Luke is not very great; but, in regard to the two
first particularly, the difference from the other writers is marked, and St. Paul’s usage of all
of them is very different. On the other hand, in the use of οὗτος, Hebrews is strongly separated
from St. Luke and less so from St. Paul.</p>
<p>The words ἀ λλήλων, ἄ λλος, ἕ τερος, τίς (interrog.), and τις (indef.) have marked peculiarities
in their frequency of employment by the different writers, but it is enough to instance
here ἄ λλος, employed oftener by St. Paul than by St. Luke and Hebrews put together, and
yet by the other writers collectively twice as often as by him; and ἕ τερος used with exactly
the same frequency by St. Luke and St. Paul, less than one quarter as often by other writers,
but far oftener in Hebrews than in any of them. So also with ἕ καστος, τοιοῦτος, and τοσοῦτος
: they are all used with exactly the same frequency in Hebrews; but while the first is used by
St. Paul much oftener, the last is used only one-fourteenth as often. The usage of St. Luke
is markedly different from that of either.</p>
<p>Further and more detailed examination of words of this class would be out of place here.
Suffice it to say that such an examination shows a marked individuality in the usage of the
several writers; and it is to be remembered that Hebrews, Acts, and the latter Epistles of St.
Paul must have been written with no great interval of time between them.</p>
<p>The same things are true in whatever way we test the forms of expression of these writers.
If we take the particle εἰ with its various combinations εἰ καί, εἰ μή, εἴγε, εἰ δὲ μή, εἰ μή τε, εἴ
περ, εἴ πῶς, εἴ τε, εἴ τις, we shall find that only the first two of these combinations occur in
Hebrews at all, and those only once each, while all of them are found in the Pauline Epistles,
and all but three of them in the writings of St. Luke. The whole group together is used more
than twice as often by St. Paul as by any other writer.</p>
<p>Adverbs of space are very sparingly used by St. Paul, with an approach to equality
between Hebrews and St. Luke, but twice as often by other writers. In the various particles
and adverbs of negation, there do not seem to be, on the whole, very noticeable peculiarities,
although υηδείς and μηδέ occur but once each in Hebrews, while the former is everywhere
else common, and the latter also in St. Paul and other writers, though less frequent in St.
Luke. But the word χωρίς is frequent enough in Hebrews to be considered characteristic, is
used far less by St. Paul, only once by St. Luke, and comparatively seldom by other writers.
Πάλιν is quite rare in St. Luke, equally common in Hebrews and St. Paul, and a little less so
in the other writers. The use of ἤ is very rare in Hebrews whether as a disjunctive conjunction,
or as a term of comparison. In the latter sense it occurs but once, and in the former only
four times, two of which are in quotations from the LXX, and a third in a more than

<pb n="668"/>
doubtful reading. In all the other New Testament writers it is very common, but most of all
in St. Paul. In the use of μᾶλλον, however, though St. Paul still exceeds, Hebrews most nearly
approaches his usage. The causal ἐ πεί is five times as frequent in Hebrews as in St. Paul,
and yet four times more frequent in his writings than in the others, and is still less common
in St. Luke than in them. The word πῶς is used but once in Hebrews (interrogatively), while
it is common enough everywhere else. Both ἵ να and ὅ τι are used very often by St. Paul and
the other writers, and much more sparingly in Hebrews; but St. Luke uses ἵ να much less
than half as often as Hebrews, while he employs ὅ τι much more than half as often again.
The un-Attic particle καθώς, the adverbs οὕτως, ὡ σεί, ὥ σπερ, and the conjunction ὥ στε,
are all appropriate to trains of reasoning, but their usage in the different writers, particularly
in the three we are especially considering, is very various. The same may be said of the prepositions,
among which σύν is never used in Hebrews (except in composition), while it is
employed much oftener by St. Luke than by St. Paul or any other writer.</p>
<p>It may be thought that all this examination—still tedious, though much condensed—is
not worth the trouble. It goes to show, what has always been noticed by every reader, that
the style of this Epistle is unlike that of St. Paul; but if it show, as it seems to do quite as
clearly, that it is unlike that of St. Luke as well, something has been gained. It makes it at
least improbable that St. Luke wrote the Epistle to give expression to the ideas of St. Paul.</p>
<p>It remains to examine some words of another class. There are many words and groups
of words so peculiarly appropriated to certain ideas or shades of thought, that the use or
non-use of them becomes a fair index of the habitual tone of thought of the writer. If he use
them frequently, the phase of truth which they represent must have been prominent in his
mind; or if he seldom employ them, then that aspect of truth was not the predominant one
from his point of view. Such words or groups of words may be of different degrees of importance;
but even those of inferior significance help to complete the picture of the writer’s
mental habits, and it is therefore well to examine all that are at all characteristic. As the force
of the evidence from these words can only be brought out by a more careful examination
of them, I venture to copy some pages of the paper referred to above.</p>
<p>The group ἀ γαπάω, ἀ γάπη, and ἀ γαπήτος is noteworthy. They are very common in
the Pauline writings, but are rare both in St. Luke and in Hebrews. In fact only one of them,
ἀ γαπήτος, occurs at all in the Acts, and none of them are ever used by St. Luke except in
recording the words of others. So also of the Hebrews. Of the five instances of their use, two
are in quotations from the LXX. They are common enough in other writers, but are special
favorites of St. John. Of the 154 instances in “other writers,” 109 are in St. John, so that the
words may be called Pauline and Johannean. Their rarity in St. Luke and Hebrews may be
partly explained by the fact that ἀ γάπη is an exclusively biblical word, and that ἀ γαπάω
also is used in a higher sense in the sacred than in profane writings. Still they were common
words in the Christian community, and they mark a distinction in thought between St. Luke

<pb n="669"/>
and Hebrews on the one side, and St. Paul and the rest of the new Testament on the other.
The actual number of instances of their use is: Hebrews, 5 times; St. Luke, 15; St. Paul, 135;
all others (John, 109), 154; but if we exclude from the enumeration all quotations from the
LXX, and all record of the words of others, the numbers become: Hebrews, 3; St. Luke, ; St.
Paul, 132; all others (John, 43), 87. The comparison is too obvious to call for proportionate
numbers. As an appendix to this group it may be mentioned that φιλέω never occurs in
Hebrews, is used only twice by St. Luke, twice by St. Paul, and 21 times elsewhere, 15 of
which are in St. John.</p>
<p>A word especially appropriate to Hebrews, and one which might have been expected
there very often, ἁ γιασμός, occurs but once, while it is used eight times by St. Paul, and is
not found in the rest of the New Testament. On the other hand, αἷμα, which we might have
expected frequently in St. Paul as well as in Hebrews, is very common in the latter and not
at all so in the former. Proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 231 times; St. Luke, 31; St.
Paul, 24; all others, 44. Here, from the nature of the writings, we may not be surprised at
the commonness of the word in Hebrews; but its comparative rarity in St. Paul is remarkable.
His subjects led to it, and had it come to his mind as readily as it did to that of the author
of Hebrews, it must have occurred in his writings much oftener.</p>
<p>The group of words, ἀ λήθεια, ἀ ληθής, ἀ ληθινός, ἀ ληθῶς, and ἀ ληθεύω, which we
are accustomed to consider peculiarly Johannean, is also very frequent in St. Paul, but
comparatively rare in St. Luke and Hebrews. The actual numbers are: Hebrews, 4 (ἀ ληθινός
three times, ἀ λήθεια once); St. Luke, 12; St. Paul, 55; all others, 114 (of which St. John, 95).</p>
<p>Of the group ἀ σθενεία, ἀ σθενέω, ἀ σθένημα, and ἀ σθενής, only two occur in Hebrews—
ἀ σθενεία (four times) and ἀ σθενής (once). The actual occurrences of the whole together
are: Hebrews, 5 times; St. Luke, 15; St. Paul, 43; all others, 21; or proportionately, Hebrews,
58; St. Luke, 23; St. Paul, 90; all others, 21. This is evidently an especially Pauline class of
words.</p>
<p>The words of opposite signification, βέβαιος, βεβαιόω, βεβαίωσις,—very infrequent in
the LXX,—do not occur at all in St. Luke, and are relatively far more frequent in Hebrews
than anywhere else. The proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 92 times; St. Luke, ; St. Paul,
15; elsewhere, 3. Evidently St. Paul preferred to dwell upon weakness, the author of Hebrews
upon strength.</p>
<p>There is a similar contrast between the verb ἐ λπίζω and the noun ἐ λπίς on the one
hand, and the verb ἐ παγγέλλομαι and the noun ἐ παγγελία on the other. Κληρονομέω,
κληρονομία, and κληρονόμος are most common in Hebrews. The proportionate numbers
are:—

</p>
<p>It is plain that while the author of Hebrews dwelt much more upon the brightness of
the future than any other writer, he preferred to speak of it in the light of promise and of
inheritance, while it rested in St. Paul’s mind more as a hope. This is the more noteworthy
because the ideas of sonship and of adoption are very common in St. Paul. He alone uses
the word υἱοθεσία five times.</p>
<p>The words ἡ μέρα and σήμερον are curiously infrequent in a writer of the present urgency
of St. Paul, and are relatively most common in St. Luke and Hebrews, but most so in the
last. In proportion the numbers are: Hebrews, 278; St. Luke, 207; St. Paul, 100; all others,
153. That is, Hebrews uses them nearly three times as often as St. Paul.</p>
<p>The names for God and for our Lord are used by the various writers with much difference,
and with an evident preference in each of them for his own accustomed word. The
proportionate numbers (which can take no note of periphrases) are as follows:—
<lg>
<l>Hebrews. St. Luke. St. Paul. All Others.</l>
<l>θεός<gap reason="omitted"/> 774<gap reason="omitted"/> 463<gap reason="omitted"/> 1016<gap reason="omitted"/> 419</l>
<l>Κύριος<gap reason="omitted"/> 185<gap reason="omitted"/> 335<gap reason="omitted"/> 524<gap reason="omitted"/> 213</l>
<l>􀀀 Ιησοῦς<gap reason="omitted"/> 150<gap reason="omitted"/> 255<gap reason="omitted"/> 405<gap reason="omitted"/> 519</l>
<l>Χριστός<gap reason="omitted"/> 150<gap reason="omitted"/> 69<gap reason="omitted"/> 562<gap reason="omitted"/> 102</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>In all cases St. Paul uses these words most freely (about twice as often as anybody else),
except that in the case of ᾽ Ιησοῦς he is exceeded by “other writers” as a result of the large
amount of narrative contained in them. Θεός is used in Hebrews next in frequency to St.
Paul, but with a long interval between them, and very much more often than elsewhere.
Κύριος is used least frequently in Hebrews, while ᾽ Ιησοῦς and Χριστός are employed there,
one with exactly the same frequency as the other, though St. Luke, St. Paul, and the other
writers employ them very unequally, one preferring one and another the other. The use of
these words is so much a matter of habit, habit alike of writing and of mode of thinking,
that these go far to differentiate the writers.</p>
<p>Κήρυγμα, κήρυξ, and κηρύσσω are none of them ever used in Hebrews. For the others
proportionate numbers are: St. Luke, 27 times; St. Paul, 35; all others, 20.</p>
<p>The group καυχάομαι, καύχημα, and καύχησις is almost exclusively Pauline, occurring
in his writings 58 times, while it is nearly absent from Hebrews, only καύχημα being used,
and that but once. These words do not occur in the other New Testament writers except
three times in James. So also λογίζομαι and μακροθυμία are especially Pauline. They each
occur only once in Hebrews. The first is found twice, the second not at all in St. Luke; but
λογίζομαι occurs 34 times in St. Paul, four times in other writers, while μακροθυμία is used
by St. Paul ten times, and only three times elsewhere.</p>

<pb n="671"/>
<p>Μανθάνω is used 16 times by St. Paul, only once each by Hebrews and St. Luke, and
seven times elsewhere. Παρακαλέω and παράκλησις are much more frequent in St. Paul’s
writings than elsewhere, but in this case he is more nearly approached by Hebrews than by
others—yet with a great difference. Proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 81; St. Luke, 54;
St. Paul, 137; all others, 22. The word προσεύχή occurs in Hebrews but once, and προσεύχομαι
not at all. This is a noteworthy omission in our epistle, although it is also true that they are
not used by St. John, except προσευχή three times in Revelation. The two words are found
in St. Luke and St. Paul each 33 times, and in the other writers 43 times. The words σάρξ
and σαρκικός are favorites of St. Paul. They occur seven times in Hebrews, six times in St.
Luke, 102 times in St. Paul, and 46 times (of which one-half are in St. John) elsewhere.
Proportionately Hebrews uses them about two-thirds as often as St. Paul, and nearly twice
as often as all other writers together. The group φρονέω, φρόνημα, and φρόνησις is characteristic.
None of them are found at all in Hebrews, and they occur but twice in St. Luke, and
twice in the other writers (Matthew, 1, Mark, 1, in parallel passages), both in the record of
the words of others; but St. Paul uses them 31 times. (He uses φρόνημα, however, only in
Romans—four times.) A word used in a figurative sense especially characteristic of St. John
(31 times), φῶς, never occurs in Hebrews. It is used 16 times by St. Luke, 12 times by St.
Paul, and ten times by other writers. It is more or less used by every New Testament writer
except the author of Hebrews, and St. Jude in his very short epistle. Χαίρω is also used by
every other writer (St. Luke, 19 times; St. Paul, 27 times), except Hebrews and St. Jude. St.
Paul greatly delights in the word χάρις, and in the idea conveyed by it; he never wrote an
epistle without it, and uses it 101 times. In Hebrews it is found eight times, in St. Luke 24,
and in all others 22, not occurring in the first two Gospels.</p>
<p>The foregoing list is somewhat long of words characteristic of phases of thought which
are especially favorite with St. Paul, and either wholly unused or much less frequently employed
in Hebrews. A corresponding list may be made of other words especially common
in Hebrews, but less used by St. Luke and St. Paul. Before going to this, however, a few words
are to be considered which in their frequency of usage are characteristic of all three, or of
two of these writers as distinguished from others, although with some differences between
them.</p>
<p>Most prominent in this latter class is νόμος, which we are accustomed to think especially
Pauline. It is indeed used much oftener by St. Paul than by any other writer, yet it also occurs
in Hebrews with a frequency distinguishing that Epistle from any other writing. The proportionate
numbers are: Hebrews, 162; St. Luke, 44; St. Paul, 227; all others, 33. Nevertheless,
the assimilation here is more apparent than real; for St. Paul employs it chiefly of a method
of salvation, while it refers in Hebrews mostly to a definite collection of statutes. In the same
way πίστις is usually regarded as a characteristically Pauline word. It is relatively much more
common in Hebrews; for the proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 369; St. Luke, 42; St.

<pb n="672"/>
Paul, 262; all others, 43. But here also there is a shade of distinction in the force of the word
as used by the two writers; St. Paul’s πίστις is reliance upon Christ as the means of salvation
in opposition to the law and the works of the law, while in the Hebrews it is only a general
reliance on God’s grace and promises. Of course, it is not denied that St. Paul sometimes
uses a word, so common, in such varied shades of meaning, in a more general way as in 1
Cor. xiii. 2, 13; xvi. 13; 2 Cor. v. 7 , etc.; but the distinction in the shade of meaning between
his habitual employment of the word, and that common in the Epistle to the Hebrews is
easily recognized. In this connection πιστεύω must be mentioned, though belonging in the
former category. The proportionate instances of its use are: Hebrews, 23; St. Luke, 76; St.
Paul, 100; all others (of which St. John, 99), 143. It is therefore a comparatively rare word
in Hebrews. The adjective πιστός, which ought perhaps hardly to be considered in this
connection, is used proportionately, in Hebrews, 58 times; St. Luke, 6; St. Paul, 61; all others,
23. Πείθω somewhat associates the three writers together, although most frequent in Hebrews,
occurring proportionately, in Hebrews, 58 times; St. Luke, 33; St. Paul, 43; all others, 6.
Συνειδέω and συνείδησις are used proportionately: Hebrews, 58; St. Luke, 8 (all in Acts);
St. Paul, 37 (but συνειδέω only once); all others, 4. The word σωτήρ, though used by St.
Luke four times, St. Paul 12, and by others eight times, never occurs in Hebrews; but this is
not remarkable, as it is not found in the much larger books of Matthew, Mark, and Revelation;
moreover, it should be taken in connection with σωτηρία and σωτήριον, which also do not
occur in the first two Gospels, but are found in Hebrews 7 times, St. Luke 13, St. Paul 19,
and all others 9 times. This would give them a relatively greater frequency in Hebrews; but
they are also common words in St. Luke and St. Paul. The word ψυχή, while a little more
common relatively in Hebrews, is yet frequent enough in St. Luke and other writers, though
not a favorite with St. Paul. Proportionate numbers are: Hebrews, 69; St. Luke, 57; St. Paul,
29; all others, 54.</p>
<p>This leads to the third class of words—those which, embodying certain sets of ideas,
are characteristic of Hebrews in distinction from other writers, especially St. Luke and St.
Paul. One of these is the idea of witness, expressed by μάρτυρ, μάρτυς, μαρτυρία, μαρτύριον,
μαρτυρέω, and μαρτύρομαι. This group of words is especially common in Hebrews, and
much less frequent in St. Luke and St. Paul. It is also very common in St. John. The proportionate
numbers are: Hebrews, 127; St. Luke, 45; St. Paul, 50; all others (of which St. John,
80), 96. The word τάξις is so naturally called for in the argument of Hebrews that there is
nothing remarkable in its occurring there seven times, while in all the rest of the New
Testament it is found but three times (St. Paul twice, St. Luke once). The perfection and finality
of Christian truth as set forth in this epistle comes out in the frequency of the use of
these words as clearly as in its general scope; it is difficult to suppose that the Epistle to the

<pb n="673"/>
Galatians, e.g., which does not contain any of these words, could have been written by the
same author.</p>
<p>But by far the most important word in this connection is ἱ ερεύς, with its various derivatives,
ἀ ρχιερεύς, ἱ ερατεία, ἱ εράτευμα, and ἀ ρχιερατικός. The last two of these are of little
importance, as ἱ εράτευμα occurs only twice, in St. Peter, and ἀ ρχιερατικός only once, in
Acts; also ἱ ερατεία occurs only once each in St. Luke and Hebrews, and nowhere else. Altogether,
ἱ ερεύς and its compounds and derivatives occur 159 times, but are never once used
by St. Paul.2658 The actual numbers are, for ἱ ερεύς : Hebrews, 14 times; St. Luke, 9; St. Paul,
; all others, 9; for ἀ ρχιερεύς, Hebrews, 17; St. Luke, 37; St. Paul, ; the other Gospels, 68, but
never elsewhere. This is a remarkable fact. In view of St. Paul’s arguments in the epistles to
the Romans and to the Galatians, and in view of the frequency and emphasis with which he
insists in all his Epistles, upon the sacrificial character of Christ’s death, it seems to show
that his mind was so absorbed in dwelling upon the value and power of the sacrifice that he
was not in the habit of thinking or speaking of Christ as also Himself the Sacrificer. Redemption
came to his thought through the medium of the Victim by whom it was obtained, but
not through that of the Priest who offered the Victim. This is the more striking from the
fact that he often speaks of Christ as giving Himself, offering Himself, and the like; but always
for the purpose of bringing out the voluntariness and the love of the act, and never with any
allusion to its priestly character. The line of reasoning in the Epistle to the Hebrews was
thus quite foreign to the habitual thought of St. Paul. Such similarity of language to his acknowledged
writings as exists must be accounted for in some other way.</p>
<p>On looking back over these various words, with their difference of usage, it is plain that
they are not perfectly of accord in their indications. This was to be expected. I have endeavored,
in this part of the examination, to select only words characteristic of thought, and
to note every word of this kind in regard to which there is any considerable difference of
usage; yet so many words are used by every writer accidentally, as it were, and not because
they are characteristic, that much allowance is to be made. Still, the investigation seems to
me to afford a sufficient basis for some probable conclusions. The Epistle contains both
style-words and thought-words, characteristic alike of St. Luke and St. Paul, sometimes of
one, sometimes of the other, sometimes of both; and these must be taken into account in
any theory of the authorship. But they are not more than might be expected in any writer
belonging among the companions of a leader of such magnetism and power as St. Paul. I
see nothing in them to prove, hardly even to suggest, actual authorship. On the other hand,
there are many words and groups of words expressing ideas very prominently in the mind
of the author of this Epistle, which must have appeared also in the writings of St. Paul had
<note type="footnote">2658 The word ἱ ερουργοῦντα (ἁ π. λεγ.) in the highly figurative passage, Rom. xv. 16, is no exception, being
derived not from ἱ ερεύς, but from ἱ ερός</note>

<pb n="674"/>
the thoughts of this Epistle been derived from him, but which are not found there. Of course,
no man expresses all his ideas in any one epistle, nor the same ideas in every one he writes;
but the difference here is more radical. As one mind now is affected by one, and another by
another of the various aspects of Christian truth, so the differences here go to show that the
mind of the author of Epistle to the Hebrews was not affected in the same way as St. Paul;
for Hebrews is scarcely more unlike the Epistles in which St. Paul addressed believing Jews
than the speeches recorded in Acts xiii., xxii., and xxviii., in which he spoke to his still unbelieving
countrymen. This leaves us free to accept the author’s own statement, that instead
of being, like St. Paul, one who had received his apostleship “not of man, neither by man,
but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father” ( Gal. i. 1 ), he was of that number who had received
through the medium of others that Gospel “which at the first began to be spoken by the
Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him” ( Heb. ii. 3 ).</p>
<p>It thus appears that neither are the thoughts of this Epistle Pauline, nor is its language
that of St. Luke. It may be well to say a few words in conclusion as to the person to whom
such facts as we have point as the probable author.</p>
<p>It is plain from what has been said, as well as from the common consent of students,
that the author must be looked for among those companions of St. Paul who, through prolonged
intercourse, were likely to have their modes of expression somewhat affected by his
language. The number of these is considerable, and after so many ages of uncertainty, beginning
with the earliest discussion of the subject, it is not likely that the right one can ever be
pointed out with certainty. Many modern critics have selected Apollos as the most probable
author, chiefly because of the facts recorded of him in Acts xviii. 24–28 , that he “was born
at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures,” and that after receiving further
instruction from Aquila and Priscilla, “he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly,
showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.” He was certainly personally known to St.
Paul ( 1 Cor. xvi. 12 ), although of the length of time they may have been together we have
no information. His being an Alexandrian is thought to explain what some are pleased to
consider an Alexandrian tone of thought in the Epistle, and also the fact that its quotations
are from the LXX, and accord rather with its Alexandrian than its Vatican recension. The
force of the last point is not obvious. In the meagreness of our knowledge of the original
LXX, it appears probable that the so-called Alexandrian recension was the one generally
current in the Levant, and therefore that this indication, whatever it may be worth, simply
points to an Oriental author. And so also whatever there may be of an Alexandrian caste
of thought in the Epistle only indicates some one familiar with Jewish-Alexandrian literature,
and this would include almost every educated Jew living in the Levant.2659 At all events,
<note type="footnote">2659 But that the style indicates that the Epistle was not actually written by an Alexandrian may be gathered
from the non-use of the optative mood. See the reference to Dr. Harman on p. 348.</note>

<pb n="675"/>
neither of these considerations seemed to have occurred to any of those early Alexandrian
scholars, Pantænus, Clement, or Origen, who all speak of the authorship, the last at some
length and with discrimination. The theory of Apollos’ authorship has, however, this great
advantage: that no line of his remains to compare with our Epistle. It has also these disadvantages:
that it never occurred to any ancient author, but was first suggested by Luther;
that there is no evidence of any prolonged personal intercourse between him and St. Paul;
and that there is nothing to connect him with any especial interest in, or familiarity with,
the Jewish ritual and temple beyond the simple fact that he was a Jew, as was also almost
every other writer who has ever been suggested. The non-use of the optative is also strongly
against the authorship of the Alexandrian Apollos. Moreover, it is clear from such passages
as vii. 12; x. 32–36; xiii. 7, 17–19, 23–25 , that this Epistle was addressed to some particular
community, a fact now generally recognized, and that the author was personally and favorably
known to his readers. There is a difference of opinion in regard to the locality of that community;
but if, as seems altogether probable, it was Palestinian, we have no reason to suppose
that Apollos was ever known to them; and although this evidence is only negative, it suggests
looking for some other names positively in accord with it.</p>
<p>Of the other names suggested in ancient and modern times St. Luke and St. Clement
of Rome seem to be sufficiently excluded by a comparison of the Epistle with their acknowledged
writings; the former also by the probability that he was a Gentile, the latter by the
very use he makes of the Epistle, apparently as quoting words of another.2660</p>
<p>Silas has also been suggested as a possible author. Of him we know even less than of
Apollos. He was a prophet in the early Church at Jerusalem ( Acts xv. 32 ), and was the
companion of St. Paul on his second missionary journey and subsequently in his labors at
Corinth, and was also associated with the work of St. Peter ( 1 Pet. v. 12 ). In all this there
is nothing to mark him out as the one likely to have written this Epistle beyond several
others of the companions of St. Paul. The only point which really gives plausibility to the
suggestion of his authorship is the fact that he was much associated with Timothy ( 1 Thess.
i. 1; 2 Thess. i. 1; 2 Cor. i. 19 ), and this may explain the reference to Timothy in Hebrews
xiii. 23. On that ground the suggestion of his name might be adopted if there were not much
<note type="footnote">2660 If the question be asked how Clement of Rome should have been so familiar with this Epistle, the sufficient
answer is, that if this Clement be the same with the Clement mentioned in Philip. iv. 3 , as is altogether probable
and as is generally asserted in the fathers, they were both companions of St. Paul, though whether they were
with him at the same time is not known, and so one of them was likely to know and value the work of the other.
Moreover, nearly all the varying traditions about Barnabas concur in speaking of his preaching at Rome, where
he would have become personally known to Clement, and whence he may have written this Epistle. If he planted
the Church at Milan, as is asserted in the title and proper preface for St. Barnabas Day, in the Ambrosian liturgy,
he must have passed through Rome on his way.</note>

more to be said in favor of another, and also if there were not the same very serious objection
as in the case of Apollos—that he was never so much as named in all antiquity.</p>
<p>There is a person, however, to whose authorship one of the very earliest witnesses,
Tertullian, as already noted, positively and unhesitatingly testifies,—Barnabas.2661 He has
the same advantage with Apollos in having transmitted to us no writing with which to insti-
tute a comparison (the spuriousness of the epistle attributed to him being admitted,)2662
and in having been a Hellenistic Jew, likely to have written somewhat better Greek than St.
Paul. His birthplace also was in the Levant, in Cyprus, where he could have had the full be-
<note type="footnote">2661 Tertullian De Pudicitia, c. 20, Tom. II., fol. 1021, ed. Migne. It is well known that the Pauline authorship
of the Epistle was rejected by many of the ancients. Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. vi. 20) mentions that in the list of
Caius, Presbyter at Rome (cir. 200), only thirteen epistles of Paul are enumerated, and this is omitted. It is
also omitted in the Muratonian fragment, if that be not the same. The Codex Claromontanus (6th cent.) was
copied from a ms. not containing Hebrews, but gives at the end of Philemon a stichometrical catalogue of all
the books of the Old and New Testaments, and then gives our Epistle. In the catalogue, however, before
Revelations and Acts, and immediately after Jude, is mentioned the “Epistle of Barnabas,” having 850 lines.
It has been conjectured that by this may be meant the Epistle to the Hebrews; for 1 Corinthians is put down
at 1060 lines, and this would give, in proportion, very nearly the right length for our Epistle, making Hebrews
820 instead of 850 lines, whereas the spurious “Epistle of Barnabas” is nearly one-half longer. (See Salmon,
Introd. to the N.T., note at end of xxi., 2d ed., pp. 453, 454.) This conclusion is controverted by Lünemann, Introd.
to Heb., sect. i., p. 23, ed. T. U+0026 T. Clark.</note>

nefit of Alexandrian literature. Being at Jerusalem he became one of the very early converts
to Christianity, long before St. Paul, and he was a man of property and benevolence; for although
a Cypriote, he had land in Jerusalem and sold it to relieve the necessities of the early
Christian community ( Acts iv. 36, 37 ). He must have been known from the first very generally
in the Hebrew-Christian community, and he must have been endeared to them, not
merely by this act of benevolence, but by that kindly sympathy which led to his surname,
“Son of consolation.” A very few writers, indeed, have identified him with “Joseph called
Barsabas, who was surname Justus,” of Acts i. 23 , and this is countenanced by the Codex
Bezæ and the Æthiopic reading βαρνάβαν ; and in this case he must have been an original
disciple, and would be excluded by the language of Heb. ii. 3. But there seems to be no
ground for the identification. In Acts iv. 36 the language implies that Barnabas is there
spoken of for the first time, the names themselves are different, and Barsabas was known
by the surname of Justus, which does not appear to have been ever given to Barnabas. He
is next heard of as bringing Saul, of whom all were afraid, to the apostles, and telling the
story of his conversion ( Acts ix. 26, 27 ), showing at once the position he occupied and his
own moral courage. When tidings of the conversion of many Gentiles at Antioch came to
the Church at Jerusalem, they sent forth Barnabas to take charge of the matter, and by his
labors “much people was added to the Lord.” The work growing too great for him, he sought
out Saul at Tarsus and brought him to his assistance ( Acts xi. 25, 26 ). Then after a year,
the Church at Antioch sent Barnabas and Saul to carry their alms to the Church at Jerusalem.
Having returned to Antioch, they were divinely selected to go forth upon a wider missionary
work, in the course of which they visited “Lystra and Derbe,” when probably the young
Timothy received his first knowledge of Christianity. On St. Paul’s second visit to these cities
he is spoken of as already “a disciple.” Barnabas must, therefore, have known him from the
very beginning of his Christian life, and it is, therefore, entirely natural that he should speak
of him in the way recorded in Heb. xiii. 23. After Barnabas and Paul returned from this,
when disputes arose between the Jews and Gentiles, they were sent to Jerusalem together,
and having obtained a favorable hearing before the Council again returned to Antioch. Here
are years of closest companionship between Barnabas and St. Paul, during all the earlier
part of which Barnabas appears as the leader, Paul as the assistant. They had often stood
together in the synagogue to tell to their fellow-countrymen the story of the cross, and
probably had often discussed with one another the numerous Jewish converts. Barnabas
must have been a man of dignity, for when the people of Lystra took them for gods, they
selected Barnabas as Jupiter ( Acts xiv. 11, 12 ). The companionship was broken up at the
entrance upon another missionary journey, by a difference of opinion about taking Mark
with them. In this case Barnabas, although doubtless influenced by his kinship, appears to
have been the better judge of character, since at a later day St. Paul writes from Rome to

<pb n="678"/>
Timothy, “Take Mark and bring him with thee; for he is profitable to me in the minis try”
( 2 Tim. iv. 11 ); but however this may be, Barnabas showed in the matter independence
and determination. He is called by the name of “Apostle” ( Acts xiv. 14 ), and altogether
held such a position in the Christian community as would make his writing such an Epistle
a proper act. In all that is related of him there is but one faulty act, and even this points him
out as especially interested in the Hebrews. When St. Peter behaved so ill at Antioch and
received the sharp reproof of St. Paul, in his account of the matter St. Paul says, “the other
Jews dissembled likewise with him”; and adds as evidence of the strength and danger of the
defection, “insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation” ( Gal.
ii. 13, 14 ). Barnabas then was not only a Jew by birth, but had strong sympathies with his
race.</p>
<p>More than this: he was a Levite. The particular line of argument adopted in the main
part of the Epistle to the Hebrews is one which would have occurred to few, and scarcely to
any who was not familiar with the temple ritual. There is no evidence that this was the case
with Apollos; but with Barnabas the temple service was a matter of professional duty, as
well as the prompting of his devout heart. Indeed, an objection to the authorship of Barnabas
has been based on this very point;—it is said that the author does not show that nicely accurate
precision in his statements which might be expected from one personally familiar
with the temple. The points referred to admit of easy explanation on other grounds; but
were they better taken, considering that the service of the Levites was altogether subordinate
to that of the priests, and did not lead them into the νάος itself, the objection seems hypercritical.
But one of the actual duties of the Levites, and a very prominent one, was that of
chanting in the Levitical choirs in the courts of the temple. This would have led to a special
familiarity with the Psalms. Now it is a curious fact that about one-half of all the quotations
from the Old Testament in the Epistle to the Hebrews are taken from the Psalms, and that
the author cites that book, relatively, nearly four times as often as St. Paul, and eight times
as often as St. Luke or the other writers. This fact is at once explained by the supposition
that the author of the Epistle was a Levite.2663 It is not unlikely that when that “great company
<note type="footnote">2663 The large proportion of quotations from the Psalms in this Epistle is noticed in the article upon it in
Smith’s Bible Dictionary (where the proportion is stated as 16 out of 32); but my attention was first called to
the bearing of this upon the question of authorship by the quick observation of Rev. Hermann Lilienthal. It
is not easy to give a precise numerical statement of the proportion because of the large number of historical
allusions which can hardly be reckoned as quotations, and also because the New Testament writers often
clothe their thoughts in the familiar words of the Old Testament, apparently without any conscious quotation.
This matter, however, which cannot be tabulated, is quite in accord with the rest, and the whole Epistle is
saturated with the language and the historical allusions of the Psalms. Taking only what may fairly be
considered as designed quotations, the relative numbers taken from the Psalms are: Hebrews, 200; St. Luke,
25; St. Paul, 39; all others, 25. The Apocalypse is omitted from the calculation. In the comparatively few</note>

of the priests were obedient to the faith” ( Acts vi. 7 ), Barnabas, as one of their attending
Levites, was influenced by their example and with them accepted the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>The only important objection urged against the authorship of Barnabas is, that since
the time of Tertullian until recently, there has never been any considerable weight of opinion
in its favor. But this is accounted for by the almost universal acceptance in the meantime
of the spurious Epistle of Barnabas as his genuine work. The two certainly could not have
been written by the same person. The fact, however, that the spurious Epistle was attributed
to him may be an indication of a belief that he had left to the Church some legacy of written
teaching. Since that Epistle has been found not to be his, and is probably of a somewhat
later day, there remains nothing to hinder the belief that the devout Levite of Cyprus, the
early convert to Christianity while still in strong sympathy with the Christian Jews, the man
of benevolence and wealth, and therefore probably of education, by birth the appointed
servant of the temple, the man of independence and dignity, and yet of such tender sympathy
as to be surnamed “Son of consolation,” the long and intimate companion of St. Paul, and
for years in the position of his superior,—there is nothing to hinder the acceptance of the
early ecclesiastical statement that he was also the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>

<p>HOMILIES OF ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM,
ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE,
ON THE
EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS</p>
<p>Published after his Falling Asleep, from Notes by Constantine, Presbyter of Antioch.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>Argument.</head>
<p>and Summary of the Epistle.</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The blessed Paul, writing to the Romans, says, “Inasmuch then as I am the Apostle
of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: if by any means I may provoke to emulation them
that are my flesh”:2664 and again, in another place, “For He that wrought effectually in Peter
to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles.”2665
If therefore he were the Apostle of the Gentiles, (for also in the Acts, God said to him, “Depart;
for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles,”2666) what had he to do with the
Hebrews? and why did he also write an Epistle to them?</p>
<p>And especially as besides, they were ill-disposed towards him, and this is to be seen
from many places. For hear what James says to him, “Thou seest, brother, how many thousands
of Jews there are which believe…and these all have been informed of thee that thou
teachest men to forsake the law.”2667 And oftentimes he had many disputings concerning
this.</p>

<pb n="681"/>
<p>Why therefore, one might ask, as he was so learned in the law (for he was instructed in
the law at the feet of Gamaliel,2668 and had great zeal in the matter, and was especially able
to confound them in this respect)—why did not God send him to the Jews? Because on this
very account they were more vehement in their enmity against him. “For they will not endure
thee,”2669 God says unto him; “But depart far hence to the Gentiles, for they will not receive
thy testimony concerning me.”2670 Whereupon he says, “Yea, Lord, they know that I imprisoned
and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee; and when the blood of
thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death, and
kept the raiment of them that slew him.”2671</p>
<p>And this he says2672 is a sign and proof of their not believing him. For thus it is: when
a man goes away from any people,2673 if he be one of the least and of those who are nothing
worth, he does not much vex those from whom he went; but if he be among the distinguished
and earnest partisans and those who care for these things, he exceedingly grieves and vexes
them beyond measure, in that2674 he especially overthrows their system with the multitude.</p>
<p>And besides this, there was something else.2675 What now might this be? That they who
were about Peter were also with Christ, and saw signs and wonders; but he <del>Paul</del> having
had the benefit of none of these, but being with Jews, suddenly deserted and became one of
them. This especially promoted our cause. For while they indeed, seemed to testify even
from gratitude, and one might have said that they bore witness to those things in love for
their Master; he, on the other hand, who testifies to the resurrection, this man was rather
one who heard a voice only. For this cause thou seest them waging war passionately with
him, and doing all things for this purpose, that they might slay him, and raising seditions.2676</p>
<p>The unbelievers, then, were hostile to him for this reason; but why were the believers?
Because in preaching to the Gentiles he was constrained to preach Christianity purely; and
if haply even in Judæa he were found <del>doing so</del>, he cared not. For Peter and they that were
with him, because they preached in Jerusalem, when there was great fierceness, of necessity
enjoined the observance of the law; but this man was quite at liberty. The <del>converts</del> too

from the Gentiles were more than the Jews because they were without.2677 And this2678
enfeebled the law, and they had no such great reverence for it, although2679 he preached all
things purely. Doubtless in this matter they think to shame him by numbers, saying, “Thou
seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are which2680 are come together.”2681
On this account they hated him and turned away from him, because “They are informed of
thee, he says, that thou teachest men to forsake the law.”2682</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Why, then, not being a teacher of the Jews, does he send an Epistle to them? And
where were those to whom he sent it? It seems to me in Jerusalem and Palestine. How then
does he send them an Epistle? Just as he baptized, though he was not commanded to baptize.</p>
<p>For, he says, “I was not sent to baptize”:2683 not, however, that he was forbidden, but he
does it as a subordinate matter. And how could he fail to write to those, for whom he was
willing even to become accursed?2684 Accordingly he said,2685 “Know ye that our brother
Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.”2686
For as yet he was not arrested. Two years then he passed bound, in Rome; then he was
set free; then, having gone into Spain, he saw Jews2687 also in like manner; and then he returned
to Rome, where also he was slain by Nero. The Epistle to Timothy then was later2688
than this Epistle. For there he says, “For I am now ready to be offered”2689 ; there also he
says, “In my first answer no man stood with me.”2690 In many places they <del>the</del> Hebrew

<del>Christians</del> had to contend2691 with persecution, as also he says, writing to the Thessalonians,
“Ye became followers of the churches of Judæa”:2692 and writing to these very persons he
says, “Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods.”2693 Dost thou see them contending?
And if men had thus treated the Apostles, not only in Judæa, but also wherever they were
among the Gentiles, what would they not have done to the believers? On this account, thou
seest, he was very careful for them. For when he says, “I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto
the saints”;2694 and again, when he exhorts the Corinthians to beneficence, and says that
the Macedonians had already made their contribution,2695 and says, “If it be meet that I go
also,”2696 —he means this. And when he says, “Only that we should remember the poor;
the same which I also was forward to do,”2697 —he declares this. And when he says, “They
gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen,
and they unto the circumcision,”2698 —he declares this.</p>
<p>But this was2699 not for the sake of the poor who were there, but that by this we might
be partakers in the beneficence. For not as the preaching did we apportion the care for the
poor to each other (we indeed to the Gentiles, but they to the circumcision). And everywhere
thou seest him using great care for them: as was reasonable.</p>
<p>Among the other nations indeed, when there were both Jews and Greeks, such was not
the case; but then, while they still seemed to have authority and independence and to order
many things by their own laws, the government not being yet established nor brought perfectly
under the Romans, they naturally exercised great tyranny. For if in other cities, as in
Corinth, they beat the Ruler of the synagogue before the Deputy’s judgment seat, and Gallio
“cared for none of these things,”2700 but it was not so in Judæa.2701 Thou seest indeed, that
while in other cities they bring them to the magistrates, and need help from them and from
the Gentiles, here they took no thought of this, but assemble a Sanhedrim themselves and
slay whom they please. Thus in fact they put Stephen to death, thus they beat the Apostles,
not taking them before rulers. Thus also they were about to put Paul to death, had not the

chief captain thrown himself2702 <del>upon them</del>. For this took place while the priests, while
the temple, while the ritual, the sacrifices were yet standing. Look indeed at Paul himself
being tried before the High Priest, and saying,“I wist not that he was the High Priest,”2703
and this in the presence of the Ruler.2704 For they had then great power. Consider then what
things they were likely to suffer who dwelt in Jerusalem and Judæa.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> He then who prays to become accursed for those who were not yet believers, and
who so ministers to the faithful, as to journey himself, if need be, and who everywhere took
great care of them;—let us not wonder if he encourage and comfort them by letters also,
and if he set them upright when tottering and fallen. For in a word, they were worn down2705
and despairing on account of their manifold afflictions. And this he shows near the end,
saying, “Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees”;2706 and again,
“Yet a little while, he that shall come will come, and will not tarry”;2707 and again, “If ye be
without chastisement,<gap reason=" omitted"/>then are ye bastards and not sons.”2708</p>
<p>For since they were Jews and learned from the fathers that they must expect both their
good and their evil immediately and must live accordingly, but then <del>when the Gospel came</del>
the opposite was <del>taught</del>—their good things being in hope and after death, their evils in
hand, though they had patiently endured much, it was likely that many would be fainthearted;—
hereon he discourses.</p>
<p>But we will unfold these things at a fit opportunity. At present: he of necessity wrote to
those for whom he cared so greatly. For while the reason why he was not sent to them is
plain, yet he was not forbidden to write. And that they were becoming fainthearted he shows
when he says, “Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make straight
paths”2709 and again, “God is not unrighteous to forget your work and love.”2710 For the
soul overtaken by many trials, was turned aside even from the faith.2711 Therefore he exhorts
them to “Give heed to the things which they have heard, and that there should not be an
evil heart of unbelief.”2712 On this account also, in this Epistle, especially, he argues at length

concerning faith, and after much <del>reasoning</del> shows at the end that to them <del>of old</del> also He
promised good things in hand, and yet gave nothing.</p>
<p>And besides these things, he establishes two points that they might not think themselves
forsaken: the one, that they should bear nobly whatever befalls them; the other, that they
should look assuredly for their recompense. For truly He will not overlook those with Abel
and the line of unrewarded righteous following him.</p>
<p>And he draws comfort in three ways: first, from the things which Christ suffered: as He
Himself says, “The servant is not greater than his Lord.”2713 Next, from the good things laid
up for the believers. Thirdly, from the evils; and this point he enforces not only from the
things to come (which would be less persuasive), but also from the past and from what had
befallen their fathers. Christ also does the same, at one time saying, “The servant is not
greater than his Lord”;2714 and again, “There are many mansions with the Father”;2715 and
He denounces innumerable woes on the unbelievers.</p>
<p>But he speaks much of both the New and the Old Covenant; for this was useful to him
for the proof of the Resurrection. Lest they should disbelieve that <del>Christ</del> rose on account
of the things which He suffered, he confirms it from the Prophets, and shows that not the
Jewish, but ours are the sacred <del>institutions</del>. For the temple yet stood and the sacrificial
rites; therefore he says, “Let us go forth therefore without, bearing His reproach.” 2716 But
this also was made an argument against him: “If these things are a shadow, if these things
are an image, how is it that they have not passed away or given place when the truth was
manifested, but these things still flourish?” This also he quietly intimates shall happen, and
that at a time close at hand.</p>
<p>Moreover, he makes it plain that they had been a long time in the faith and in afflictions,
saying, “When for the time ye ought to be teachers,”2717 and, “Lest there be in any of you
an evil heart of unbelief,”2718 and ye became “Followers of them who through patience inherit
the promises.”2719</p>

<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>Hebrews i. 1, 2</p>
<p>“God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
Prophets, hath at the end of the days2720 spoken unto us by His Son whom He hath appointed
heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Truly, “where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.” ( Rom. v. 20.) This at
least the blessed Paul intimates here also, in the very beginning of his Epistle to the Hebrews.
For since as it was likely that afflicted, worn out by evils, and judging of things thereby, they
would think themselves worse off than all other men,—he shows that herein they had rather
been made partakers of greater, even very exceeding, grace; arousing the hearer at the very
opening of his discourse. Wherefore he says, “God who at sundry times and in divers manners
spake in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath at the end of the days spoken
unto us by His Son.”</p>
<p>Why did he <del>Paul</del> not oppose “himself” to “the prophets”? Certainly, he was much
greater than they, inasmuch as a greater trust was committed to him. Yet he doth not so.
Why? First, to avoid speaking great things concerning himself. Secondly, because his hearers
were not yet perfect. And thirdly, because he rather wished to exalt them, and to show that
their superiority was great. As if he had said, What so great matter is it that He sent prophets
to our fathers? For to us <del>He has sent</del> His own only-begotten Son Himself.</p>
<p>And well did he begin thus, “At sundry times and in divers manners,” for he points out
that not even the prophets themselves saw God; nevertheless, the Son saw Him. For the expressions,
“at sundry times and in divers manners” are the same as “in different ways.” “For
I” (saith He) “have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the Prophets.”
( Hos. xii. 10.) Wherefore the excellency consists not in this alone, that to them indeed
prophets were sent, but to us the Son; but that none of them saw God, but the Only-begotten
Son saw Him. He doth not indeed at once assert this, but by what he says afterwards he establishes
it, when he speaks concerning His human nature; “For to which of the Angels said
He, Thou art My Son,” ( ver. 5 ), and, “Sit thou on My right hand”? ( Ver. 13.)</p>
<p>And look on his great wisdom. First he shows the superiority from the prophets. Then
having established this as acknowledged, he declares that to them indeed He spake by the
prophets, but to us by the Only-begotten. Then <del>He spake</del> to them by Angels, and this again
<note type="footnote">2720 ἐ σχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐσχάτων τ. ἡ. (in these last days) Sav. Ben. here and throughout the Homily.
The former is considered to be the true reading of the Sacred Text. It is throughout the reading of St. Chrys.
as is clear from his argument. [It is the reading of all the uncials; the cursives and the versions are divided.
The R.V. follows the correct text.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="687"/>
he establishes, with good reason (for angels also held converse with the Jews): yet even herein
we have the superiority, inasmuch as the Master <del>spake</del> to us, but to them servants, and
prophets, fellow-servants.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Well also said he, “at the end of the days,” for by this he both stirs them up and encourages
them desponding of the future. For as he says also in another place, “The Lord is
at hand, be careful for nothing” ( Philip. iv. 5, 6 ), and again, “For now is our salvation
nearer than when we believed” ( Rom. xiii. 11 ): so also here. What then is it which he says?
That whoever is spent in the conflict, when he hears of the end thereof, recovers his breath
a little, knowing that it is the end indeed of his labors, but the beginning of his rest.</p>
<p>“Hath in the end of the days spoken unto us in <del>His</del> Son.” Behold again he uses the
saying, “in <del>His</del> Son,”2721 for “through the Son,”2722 against those who assert that this
phrase is proper to the Spirit.2723 Dost thou see that the <del>word</del> “in” is “through”?2724</p>
<p>And the expression, “In times past,” and this, “In the end of the days,” shadows forth
some other meaning:—that when a long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of
punishment, when the Gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when
we were expecting to have less than all—then we have had more.</p>
<p>And see how considerately he hath spoken it. For he said not, “Christ spake” (albeit it
was He who did speak), but inasmuch as their souls were weak, and they were not yet able
to hear the things concerning Christ, he says, “God hath spoken by Him.” What meanest
thou? did God speak through the Son? Yes. What then? Is it thus thou showest the superiority?
for here thou hast but pointed out that both the New and the Old <del>Covenants</del> are of
One and the same: and that this superiority is not great. Wherefore he henceforth follows
on upon this argument, saying, “He spake unto us by <del>His</del> Son.”</p>
<p>(Note, how Paul makes common cause, and puts himself on a level with the disciples,
saying, He spake “to us”: and yet He did not speak to him, but to the Apostles, and through
them to the many. But he lifts them <del>the Hebrews</del> up, and declares that He spake also to
them. And as yet he doth not at all reflect on the Jews. For almost all to whom the prophets

διὰ τοῦ Υἱοῦ ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ̔Αγίῳ. They said that the latter, by which they meant to imply inferiority in
the Third Person especially, was the only proper form. This gave occasion to St. Basil’s writing his Tract De
Spiritu Sancto, in which he refutes them at large, proving among other things that ἐ ν is in Scripture often
equivalent to σύν. c. 25 t. iii. 49. That ἐ ν is put for διὰ ; is also said by St. Chrys. Hom. on 1 Cor. i. 4 (p. 13, O.T.)
and elsewhere.</note>

spake, were a kind of evil and polluted persons. But as yet the discourse is not of these: but,
hitherto of the gifts derived from God.)</p>
<p>“Whom He appointed,” saith he, “heir of all.” What is “whom He appointed heir of all”?
He speaks here of the flesh <del>the human nature</del>. As He also says in the second Psalm, “Ask
of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.” ( Ps. ii. 8.) For no longer is
“Jacob the portion of the Lord” nor “Israel His inheritance” ( Deut. xxxii. 9 ), but all men:
that is to say, He hath made Him Lord of all: which Peter also said in the Acts, “God hath
made Him both Lord and Christ.” ( Acts ii. 36.) But he has used the name “Heir,” declaring
two things: His proper sonship2725 and His indefeasible sovereignty. “Heir of all,” that is,
of all the world.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Then again he brings back his discourse to its former point. “By whom also He
made the worlds <del>the ages</del>.”2726 Where are those who say, There was <del>a time</del> when He was
not?</p>
<p>Then, using degrees of ascent, he uttered that which is far greater than all this, saying,</p>
<p>Ver. 3, 4. “Who, (being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,
and upholding all things by the word of His power,) when He had by Himself purged our
sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made2727 so much better
than the Angels as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.”</p>
<p>O! the wisdom of the Apostle! or rather, not the wisdom of Paul, but the grace of the
Spirit is the thing to wonder at. For surely he uttered not these things of his own mind, nor
in that way did he find his wisdom. (For whence could it be? From the knife, and the skins,
or the workshop?) But it was from the working of God. For his own understanding did not
give birth to these thoughts, which was then so mean and slender as in nowise to surpass
the baser sort; (for how could it, seeing it spent itself wholly on bargains and skins?) but the
grace of the Spirit shows forth its strength by whomsoever it will.</p>
<p>For just as one, wishing to lead up a little child to some lofty place, reaching up even to
the top of Heaven, does this gently and by degrees, leading him upwards by the steps from
below,—then when he has set him on high, and bidden him to gaze downwards, and sees
him turning giddy and confused, and dizzy, taking hold of him, he leads him down to the
lower stand, allowing him to take breath; then when he hath recovered it, leads him up
again, and again brings him down;—just so did the blessed Paul likewise, both with the
Hebrews and everywhere, having learnt it from his Master. For even He also did so; sometimes
He led His hearers up on high, and sometimes He brought them down, not allowing
them to remain very long.</p>

<p>See him, then, even here—by how many steps he led them up, and placed them near
the very summit of religion, and then or ever they grow giddy, and are seized with dizziness,
how he leads them again lower down, and allowing them to take breath, says, “He spake
unto us by <del>His</del> Son,” “whom He appointed Heir of all things.”2728 For the name of Son is
so far common. For where a true2729 <del>Son</del> it is understood of, He is above all: but however
that may be, for the present he proves that He is from above.</p>
<p>And see how he says it: “Whom He appointed,” saith he, “heir of all things.” The phrase,
“He appointed Heir,” is humble. Then he placed them on the higher step, adding, “by whom
also He made the worlds.” Then on a higher still, and after which there is no other, “who
being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person.” Truly he has led
them to unapproachable light, to the very brightness itself. And before they are blinded see
how he gently leads them down again, saying, “and upholding all things by the word of His
power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty.”
He does not simply say, “He sat down,” but “after the purifying, He sat down,” for he hath
touched on the Incarnation, and his utterance is again lowly.</p>
<p>Then again having said a little by the way (for he says, “on the right hand of the Majesty
on high”), <del>he turns</del> again to what is lowly; “being made so much better than the angels,
as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” Henceforward then
he treats here of that which is according to the flesh, since the phrase “being made better”
doth not express His essence according to the Spirit, 2730 (for that was not “made” but “begotten,”)
but according to the flesh: for this was “made.” Nevertheless the discourse here is
not about being called into2731 existence. But just as John says, “He that cometh after me,
is preferred before me” ( John i. 15, 30 ), that is, higher in honor and esteem; so also here,
“being made so much better than the angels”—that is, higher in esteem and better and more
glorious, “by how much He hath obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they.”
<note type="footnote">2728 That is for the moment St. Paul does not argue the dignity of Christ from the title “Son” —from His
being the true Son of God, and therefore God, but condescending to the weakness of his hearers, at first uses
the word in a general sense, and establishes His Divinity by other considerations.</note>

Seest thou that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh? For this Name, 2732
God the Word ever had; He did not afterwards “obtain it by inheritance”; nor did He afterwards
become “better than the Angels, when He had purged our sins”; but He was always
“better,” and better without all comparison.2733 For this is spoken of Him according to the
flesh.</p>
<p>So truly it is our way also, when we talk of man, to speak things both high and low.
Thus, when we say, “Man is nothing,” “Man is earth,” “Man is ashes,” we call the whole by
the worse part. But when we say, “Man is an immortal animal,” and “Man is rational, and
of kin to those on high,” we call again the whole by the better part. So also, in the case of
Christ, sometimes Paul discourseth from the less and sometimes from the better; wishing
both to establish the economy, and also to teach about the incorruptible nature.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Since then “He hath purged our sins,” let us continue pure; and let us receive no
stain, but preserve the beauty which He hath implanted in us, and His comeliness undefiled
and pure, “not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing.” ( Eph. v. 27.) Even little sins are
“a spot and a wrinkle,” such a thing, I mean, as Reproach, Insult, Falsehood.</p>
<p>Nay, rather not even are these small, but on the contrary very great: yea so great as to
deprive a man even of the kingdom of Heaven. How, and in what manner? “He that calleth
his brother fool, is in danger” (He saith) “of hellfire.” ( Matt. v. 22.) But if it be so with him
who calls a man “fool,” which seems to be the slightest of all things, and rather mere children’s
talk; what sentence of punishment will not he incur, who calleth him malignant and crafty
and envious, and casteth at him ten thousand other reproaches? What more fearful than
this?</p>
<p>Now suffer, I beseech you, the word <del>of exhortation</del>.2734 For if he that “doeth” <del>aught</del>
to “one of the least, doeth it to Him” ( Matt. xxv. 40 ), and he that “doeth it not to one of
the least doeth it not to Him” ( Matt. xxv. 45 ), how is it not the same also in the matter of
good or evil speaking? He that reviles his brother, reviles God: and he that honors his
brother, honors God. Let us train therefore our tongue to speak good words. For “refrain,”
it is said, “thy tongue from evil.” ( Ps. xxxiv. 13.) For God gave it not that we should speak
evil, that we should revile, that we should calumniate one another; but to sing hymns to
God withal, to speak those things which “give grace to the hearers” ( Eph. iv. 29 ), things
for edification, things for profit.</p>
<note type="footnote">2732 That is the Name Son. The passage is thus rightly pointed by Mr. Field in accordance with the addition
of the explanatory word “Son” in [Niketas’] Catena (Supp.). According to the pointing of the other editions, the
translation would be, “For this Name, God the Word, He ever had.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2733 ἀ συγκρίτως</note>
<note type="footnote">2734 Comp. Heb. xiii. 22. It seems as if the hearers were showing themselves surprised at the severity of what
he was saying.</note>

<pb n="691"/>
<p>Hast thou spoken evil of a man? What is thy gain, entangling thyself in mischief together
with him? For thou hast obtained the reputation of a slanderer. For there is not any, no not
any evil, which stops at him that suffers it, but it includes the doer also. As for instance, the
envious person seems indeed to plot against another, but himself first reaps the fruit of his
sin, wasting and wearing himself away, and being hated of all men. The cheat deprives another
of his money; yea and himself too of men’s good will: and causes himself to be evil
spoken of by all men. Now reputation is much better than money, for the one it is not easy
to wash out, whereas it is easy to gain possession of the other. Or rather, the absence of the
one doth no hurt to him that wanteth it; but the absence of the other makes you reproached
and ridiculed, and an object of enmity and warfare to all.</p>
<p>The passionate man again first punishes and tears himself in pieces, and then him with
whom he is angry.</p>
<p>Just so the evil speaker disgraces first himself and then him who is evil-spoken of: or, it
may be, even this hath proved beyond his power, and while he departs with the credit of a
foul and detestable kind of person, he causes the other to be loved the more. For when a
man hearing a bad name given him, doth not requite the giver in the same kind, but praises
and admires, he doth not praise the other, but himself. For I before observed that, as
calumnies against our neighbors first touch those who de vise the mischief, so also good
works done towards our neighbors, gladden first those who do them. The parent either of
good, or evil, justly reaps the fruit of it first himself. And just as water, whether it be brackish
or sweet, fills the vessels of those who resort to it, but lessens not the fountain which sends
it forth; so surely also, both wickedness and virtue, from whatever person they proceed,
prove either his joy or his ruin.</p>
<p>So far as to the things of this world; but what speech may recount the things of that
world, either the goods or the evils? There is none. For as to the blessings, they surpass all
thought, not speech only; for their opposites are expressed indeed in terms familiar to us.
For fire, it is said, is there, and darkness, and bonds, and a worm that never dieth. But this
represents not only the things which are spoken of, but others more intolerable. And to
convince thee, consider at once this first: if it be fire, how is it also darkness? Seest thou how
that fire is more intolerable than this? For it hath no light. If it be fire, how is it forever
burning? Seest thou how something more intolerable than this happens? For it is not
quenched. Yea, therefore it is called unquenchable. Let us then consider how great a misery
it must be, to be forever burning, and to be in darkness, and to utter unnumbered groanings,
and to gnash the teeth, and not even to be heard. For if here any one of those ingeniously
brought up, should he be cast into prison, speaks of the mere ill savor, and the being laid in
darkness, and the being bound with murderers, as more intolerable than any death: think
what it is when we are burning with the murderers of the whole world, neither seeing nor
being seen, but in so vast a multitude thinking that we are alone. For the darkness and gloom

<pb n="692"/>
doth not allow our distinguishing those who are near to us, but each will burn as if he were
thus suffering alone. Moreover, if darkness of itself afflicteth and terrifieth our souls, how
then will it be when together with the darkness there are likewise so great pains and burnings?</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you to be ever revolving these things with yourselves, and to submit
to the pain of the words, that we may not undergo the punishment of the things. For assuredly,
all these things shall be, and those whose doings have deserved those chambers of
torture no man shall rescue, not father, nor mother, nor brother. “For a brother redeemeth
not,” He saith; “shall a man redeem?” ( Ps. xlix. 7 , LXX.), though he have much confidence,
though he have great power with God. For it is He Himself who rewards every one according
to his works, and upon these depends our salvation or punishment.</p>
<p>Let us make then to ourselves “friends of the mammon of unrighteousness” ( Luke xvi.
9 ), that is: Let us give alms; let us exhaust our possessions upon them, that so we may exhaust
that fire: that we may quench it, that we may have boldness there. For there also it is not
they who receive us, but our own work: for that it is not simply their being our friends which
can save us, learn from what is added. For why did He not say, “Make to yourselves friends,
that they may receive you into their everlasting habitations,” but added also the manner?
For saying, “of the mammon of unrighteousness,” He points out that we must make friends
of them by means of our possessions, showing that mere friendship will not protect us, unless
we have good works, unless we spend righteously the wealth unrighteously gathered.</p>
<p>Moreover, this our discourse, of Almsgiving I mean, fits not only the rich, but also the
needy. Yea even if there be any person who supporteth himself by begging, even for him is
this word. For there is no one, so poverty-stricken, however exceeding poor he may be, as
not to be able to provide “two mites.” ( Luke xxi. 2.) It is therefore possible that a person
giving a small sum from small means, should surpass those who have large possessions and
give more; as that widow did. For not by the measure of what is given, but by the means
and willingness of the givers is the extent of the alms-deed estimated. In all cases the will is
needed, in all, a right disposition; in all, love towards God. If with this we do all things,
though having little we give little, God will not turn away His face, but will receive it as great
and admirable: for He regards the will, not the gifts: and if He see that to be great, He assigneth
His decrees and judges accordingly, and maketh them partakers of His everlasting
benefits.</p>
<p>Which may God grant us all to obtain, by the grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and
for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews i. 3</p>
<p>“Who being the brightness of His Glory and the express Image of His person, and upholding
all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Everywhere indeed a reverential mind is requisite, but especially when we say or
hear anything of God: Since neither can tongue speak nor thought2735 hear anything suitable
to our God. And why speak I of tongue or thought?2736 For not even the understanding2737
which far excels these, will be able to comprehend anything accurately, when we desire to
utter aught concerning God. For if “the peace of God surpasseth all understanding” ( Philip.
iv. 7 ), and “the things which are prepared for them that love Him have not entered into the
heart of man” ( 1 Cor. ii. 9 ); much more He Himself, the God of peace, the Creator of all
things, doth by a wide measure exceed our reasoning. We ought therefore to receive all
things with faith and reverence, and when our discourse2738 fails through weakness, and is
not able to set forth accurately the things which are spoken, then especially to glorify God,
for that we have such a God, surpassing both our thought and our conception.2739 For many
of our conceptions2740 about God, we are unable to express, as also many things we express,
but have not strength to conceive of them. As for instance:—That God is everywhere, we
know; but how, we no longer understand.2741 That there is a certain incorporeal power the
cause of all our good things, we know: but how it is, or what it is, we know not. Lo! we speak,
and do not understand. I said, That He is everywhere, but I do not understand it. I said,
That He is without beginning, but I do not understand it. I said, That He begat from Himself,
and again I know not how I shall understand it. And some things there are which we may
not even speak—as for instance, thought conceives 2742 but cannot utter.</p>
<p>And to show thee that even Paul is weak and doth not put out his illustrations with exactness;
and to make thee tremble and refrain from searching too far, hear what he says,
having called Him Son and named Him Creator, “Who being the brightness of His Glory,
and the express image of His person.”</p>

<p>This we must receive with reverence and clear of all incongruities. “The brightness of
His glory,” saith he. But observe in what reference he understands this, and so do thou receive
it:—that He is of Him:2743 without passion: that He is neither greater, nor less; since there
are some, who derive certain strange things from the illustration. For, say they, “the
brightness” is not substantial,2744 but hath its being in another. Now do not thou, O man,
so receive it, neither be thou sick of the disease of Marcellus2745 and Photinus.2746 For he
hath a remedy for thee close at hand, that thou fall not into that imagination, nor doth he
leave thee to be hurried down into that fatal malady. And what saith he? “And the express
image of His person” <del>or “subsistence”2747</del>: that is, just as He <del>the Father</del> is personally
subsisting, being in need of nothing,2748 so also the Son. For he saith this here, showing the
undeviating similitude2749 and the peculiar image of the Prototype, that He <del>the Son</del> is in
subsistence by Himself.</p>
<p>For he who said above, that “by Him He made all things” here assigns to Him absolute
authority. For what doth he add? “And upholding all things by the word of His power”; that
we might hence infer not merely His being the express image of His Person, but also His
governing all things with absolute authority.</p>
<p>See then, how he applies to the Son that which is proper to the Father. For on this account
he did not say simply, “and upholding all things,” nor did he say, “by His power,” but, “by
the word of His power.” For much as just now we saw him gradually ascend and descend;
so also now, as by steps, he goes up on high, then again descends, and saith, “by whom also
He made the worlds.”</p>

<p>Behold how here also he goes on two paths, by the one leading us away from Sabellius,
by the other from Arius, yea and on another, that He <del>Christ</del> should not be accounted un
originated,2750 which he does also throughout, nor yet alien from God. For if, even after so
much, there are some who assert that He is alien, and assign to Him another father, and say
that He is at variance with Him;—had <del>Paul</del> not declared these things, what would they
not have uttered?</p>
<p>How then does he this? When he is compelled to heal, then is he compelled also to utter
lowly things: as for instance, “He appointed Him” (saith he) “heir of all things,” and “by
Him He made the worlds.” (Supra, ver. 2.) But that He might not be in another way dishonored,
he brings Him up again to absolute authority and declares Him to be of equal
honor with the Father, yea, so equal, that many thought Him to be the Father.</p>
<p>And observe thou his great wisdom. First he lays down the former point and makes it
sure accurately. And when this is shown, that He is the Son of God, and not alien from Him,
he thereafter speaks out safely all the high sayings, as many as he will. Since any high speech
concerning Him, led many into the notion just mentioned, he first sets down what is humiliating
and then safely mounts up as high as he pleases. And having said, “whom He appointed
heir of all things,” and that “by Him He made the worlds,” he then adds, “and upholding
all things by the word of His power.” For He that by a word only governs all things, could
not be in need of any one, for the producing all things.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And to prove this, mark how again going forward, and laying aside the “by whom,”
he assigns to Him absolute power. For after he had effected what he wished by the use of it,
thenceforward leaving it, what saith he? “Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation
of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands.” (Infra, ver. 10.) Nowhere is
there the saying “by whom,” or that “by Him He made the worlds.” What then? Were they
not made by Him? Yes, but not, as thou sayest or imaginest, “as by an instrument”: nor as
though He would not have made them unless the Father had reached out a hand to Him.
For as He “judgeth no man” ( John v. 22 ), and is said to judge by the Son, in that He begat
Him a judge; so also, to create by Him, in that He begat Him a Creator. And if the Father
be the original cause of Him, in that He is Father, much more of the things which have been
made by Him. When therefore he would show that He is of Him, he speaks of necessity
lowly things. But when he would utter high things, Marcellus takes a handle, and Sabellius;
avoiding however the excess of both, he holds a middle <del>way</del>. For neither does he dwell on
the humiliation, lest Paul of Samosata should obtain a standing place, nor yet does he for
<note type="footnote">2750 ἄ ναρχον. On this third heresy respecting the Holy Trinity, see St. Greg. Naz. Orat. ii. 37; xx. 6; in both
which places it is, as here, mentioned as the third form of error with Sabellianism and Arianism. See also Bp.
Bull, Def. Fid. N. iv. i. 8. The mention of this is not found in the Common text, in which the whole passage is
recast.</note>

<pb n="696"/>
ever abide in the high sayings; but shows on the contrary His abundant nearness, lest
Sabellius rush in upon him. He names Him “Son,” and immediately Paul of Samosata comes
on him, saying that He is a son, as the many are. But he gives him a fatal wound, calling
Him “Heir.” But yet, with Arius, he is shameless. For the saying, “He appointed Him heir,”
they both hold: the former one saying, it comes of weakness; the other still presses objections,
endeavoring to support himself by the clause which follows. For by saying, “by whom also
He made the worlds,” he strikes backwards the impudent Samosatene: while Arius still
seems to be strong. Nevertheless see how he smites him likewise, saying again, “who being
the brightness of His glory.” But behold! Sabellius again springs on us, with Marcellus, and
Photinus: but on all these also he inflicts one blow, saying, “and the express image of His
person and upholding all things by the word of His power.” Here again he wounds Marcion
too;2751 not very severely, but however he doth wound him. For through the whole of this
Epistle he is fighting against them.</p>
<p>But the very thing which he said, “the brightness of the glory,” hear also Christ Himself
saying, “I am the Light of the world.” ( John viii. 12.) Therefore he <del>the Apostle</del> uses the
word “brightness,” showing that this was said in the sense of “Light of Light.” Nor is it this
alone which he shows, but also that He hath enlightened our souls; and He hath Himself
manifested the Father, and by “the brightness” he has indicated the nearness of the Being
<del>of the Father and the Son2752</del>. Observe the subtlety of his expressions. He hath taken one
essence and subsistence to indicate two subsistences. Which he also doth in regard to the
knowledge of the Spirit2753 ; for as he saith that the knowledge of the Father is one with that
of the Spirit, as being indeed one, and in nought varying from itself ( 1 Cor. ii. 10–12 ): so
also here he hath taken hold of one certain <del>thing</del> whereby to express the subsistence of
the Two.2754</p>
<p>And he adds that He is “the express Image.” For the “express Image” is something
other2755 than its Prototype: yet not Another in all respects, but as to having real subsistence.
Since here also the term, “express image,” indicates there is no variation from that whereof
<note type="footnote">2751 Because Marcion, holding the Creation to be evil, denied the Son’s preserving Power.</note>

it is the “express image”: its similarity in all respects. When therefore he calls Him both
Form,2756 and express Image, what can they say? “Yea,” saith he, “man is also called an
Image of God.”2757 What then! is he so <del>an image of Him</del> as the Son is? No (saith he) but
because the term, image, doth not show resemblance. And yet, in that man is called an Image,
it showeth resemblance, as in man. For what God is in Heaven, that man is on earth, I mean
as to dominion. And as he hath power over all things on earth, so also hath God power over
all things which are in heaven and which are on earth. But otherwise, man is not called
“Express image,” he is not called Form: which phrase declares the substance, or rather both
substance and similarity in substance. Therefore just as “the form of a slave” ( Philip. ii. 6,
7 ) expresses no other thing than a man without variation2758 <del>from human nature</del>, so also
“the form of God” expresses no other thing than God.</p>
<p>“Who being” (saith he) “the brightness of His glory.” See what Paul is doing. Having
said, “Who being the brightness of His glory,” he added again, “He sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty”: what names he hath used, nowhere finding a name for the Substance.
For neither “the Majesty,” nor “the Glory” setteth forth the Name, which he wishes to say,
but is not able to find a name. For this is what I said at the beginning, that oftentimes we
think something, and are not able to express <del>it</del>: since not even the word God is a name of
substance, nor is it at all possible to find a name of that Substance.</p>
<p>And what marvel, if it be so in respect of God, since not even in respect of an Angel,
could one find a name expressive of his substance? Perhaps too, neither in respect of the
soul. For this name <del>soul</del> doth not seem to me to be significative of the substance thereof,
but of breathing. For one may see that the same <del>thing</del> is called both Soul and Heart and
Mind: for, saith he, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” ( Ps. li. 10 ), and one may often see
that it <del>the soul</del> is called spirit.</p>
<p>“And upholding all things by the word of His power.” Tell me, “God said” (it is written),
“Let there be light” ( Gen. i. 3 ): “the Father, saith one,2759 commanded, and the Son obeyed”?
But behold here He also [the Son] acts by word. For (saith he), “And upholding all
things”—that is, governing; He holds together what would fall to pieces; For, to hold the
world together, is no less than to make it, but even greater (if one must say a strange thing).
For the one is to bring forward something out of things which are not: but the other, when
things which have been made are about to fill back into non-existence, to hold and fasten
them together, utterly at variance as they are with each other: this is indeed great and wonderful,
and a certain proof of exceeding power.</p>

the figure of those who simply with their finger move anything, and cause it to go round.)
Here he shows both the mass of the creation to be great, and that this greatness is nothing
to Him. Then again he shows the freedom from the labor, saying, “By the word of His
power.” Well said he, “By the word.” For since, with us, a word is accounted to be a bare
thing, he shows that it is not bare with God. But, how “He upholdeth by the word,” he hath
not further added: for neither is it possible to know. Then he added concerning His majesty:
for thus John also did: having said that “He is God” ( John i. 1 ), he brought in the handiwork
of the Creation. For the same thing which the one indirectly expressed, saying, “In the beginning
was the Word,” and “All things were made by Him” ( John i. 3 ), this did the other
also openly declare by “the Word,” and by saying “by whom also He made the worlds.” For
thus he shows Him to be both a Creator, and before all ages. What then? when the prophet
saith, concerning the Father, “Thou art from everlasting and to everlasting” ( Ps. xc. 2 ), and
concerning the Son, that He is before all ages, and the maker of all things—what can they
say? Nay rather, when the very thing which was spoken of the Father,—“He which was before
the worlds,”—this one may see spoken of the Son also? And that which one saith, “He was
life” ( John i. 4 ), pointing out the preservation of the creation, that Himself is the Life of all
things,—so also saith this other, “and upholding all things by the word of His power”: not
as the Greeks who defraud Him, as much as in them lies, both of Creation itself, and of
Providence, shutting up His power, to reach only as far as to the Moon.</p>
<p>“By Himself” (saith he) “having purged our sins.” Having spoken concerning those
marvelous and great matters, which are most above us, he proceeds to speak also afterwards
concerning His care for men. For indeed the former expression, “and upholding all things,”
also was universal: nevertheless this is far greater, for it also is universal: for, for His part,
“all” men believed.2761 As John also, having said, “He was life,” and so pointed out His
providence, saith again, and “He was light.”</p>
<p>“By Himself,” saith he, “having purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high.” He here setteth down two very great proofs of His care: first the “purifying
us from our sins,” then the doing it “by Himself.” And in many places, thou seest him
making very much of this,—not only of our reconciliation with God, but also of this being
accomplished through the Son. For the gift being truly great, was made even greater by the
fact that it was through the Son.</p>
<p>For2762 in saying, “He sat on the right hand,” and, “having by Himself purged our
sins,”—though he had put us in mind of the Cross, he quickly added the mention of the

resurrection and ascension. And see his unspeakable wisdom: he said not, “He was commanded
to sit down,” but “He sat down.” Then again, lest thou shouldest think that He
standeth, he subjoins, “For to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit thou on My right
hand.”</p>
<p>“He sat” (saith he) “on the right hand of the Majesty on high.” What is this “on high”?
Doth he enclose God in place? Away with such a thought! but just as, when he saith, “on
the right hand,” he did not describe Him as having figure, but showed His equal dignity
with the Father; so, in saying “on high,” he did not enclose Him there, but expressed the
being higher than all things, and having ascended up above all things. That is, He attained
even unto the very throne of the Father: as therefore the Father is on high, so also is He. For
the “sitting together” implies nothing else than equal dignity. But if they say, that He said,
“Sit Thou,” we may ask them, What then? did He speak to Him standing? Moreover, he
said not that He commanded, not that He enjoined, but that “He said”: for no other reason,
than that thou mightest not think Him without origin and without cause. For that this is
why he said it, is evident from the place of His sitting. For had he intended to signify inferiority,
he would not have said, “on the right hand,” but on the left hand.</p>
<p>Ver. 4. “Being made,” saith he, “so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they.” The “being made,” here, is instead of “being
shown forth,” as one may say. Then also from what does he reason confidently? From the
Name. Seest thou that the name Son is wont to declare true relationship? And indeed if He
were not a true Son (and “true” is nothing else than “of Him”), how does he reason confidently
from this? For if He be Son only by grace, He not only is not “more excellent than the
angels,” but is even less than they. How? Because righteous men too were called sons; and
the name son, if it be not a genuine son, doth not avail to show the “excellency.” When too
he would point out that there is a certain difference between creatures and their maker, hear
what he saith:</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “For to which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have
I begotten Thee. And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son”? For
these things indeed are spoken with reference also to the flesh: “I will be to Him a Father,
and He shall be to Me a Son”—while this,2763 “Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten
Thee,” expresses nothing else than “from [the time] that God is.” For as He is said to be,2764
from the time present (for this befits Him more than any other), so also the <del>word</del> “Today”
seems to me to be spoken here with reference to the flesh. For when He hath taken
<note type="footnote">2763 Sav. and Ben. omit the words σήμερον … σε, and for ἐ ξ οὗ ἐστιν ὁ θεός ὥσπερ γὰρ have ἐ ξ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν·

<pb n="700"/>
hold of it, thenceforth he speaks out all boldly. For indeed the flesh partakes of the high
things, just as the Godhead of the lowly. For He who disdained not to become man, and did
not decline the reality, how should He have declined the expressions?</p>
<p>Seeing then that we know these things, let us be ashamed of nothing, nor have any high
thoughts. For if He Himself being God and Lord and Son of God, did not decline to take
the form of a slave, much more ought we to do all things, though they be lowly. For tell me,
O man, whence hast thou high thoughts? from things of this life? but these or ever they appear,
run by. Or, from things spiritual? nay, this is itself one spiritual excellency,—to have
no high thoughts.</p>
<p>Wherefore then dost thou cherish high thoughts? because thou goest on aright? hear
Christ saying, “When ye have done all things, say, we are unprofitable servants, for we have
done that which was our duty to do.” ( Luke xvii. 10.)</p>
<p>Or because of thy wealth hast thou high thoughts? Dost thou not see those before thee,
how they departed naked and desolate? did we not come naked into life, and naked also
shall depart? who hath high thoughts on having what is another’s? for they who will use it
to their own enjoyment alone, are deprived of it how ever unwillingly, often before death,
and at death certainly. But (saith one) while we live we use them as we will. First of all, one
doth not lightly see any man using what he hath as he will. Next, if a man do even use things
as he will, neither is this a great matter: for the present time is short compared with the ages
without end. Art thou high-minded, O man, because thou art rich? on what account? for
what cause? for this befalleth also robbers, and thieves, and man-slayers, and effeminate,
and whoremongers, and all sorts of wicked men. Wherefore then art thou high-minded?
Since if thou hast made meet use of it, thou must not be high-minded, lest thou profane the
commandment: but if unmeet, by this indeed <del>it has come to pass that</del> thou art become a
slave of money, and goods, and art overcome by them. For tell me, if any man sick of a fever
should drink much water, which for a short space indeed quencheth his thirst, but afterwards
kindleth the flame, ought he to be high-minded? And what, if any man have many cares
without cause, ought he therefore to be high-minded? tell me, wherefore? because thou hast
many masters? because thou hast ten thousand cares? because many will flatter thee? <del>Surely
not.</del> For thou art even their slave. And to prove that to thee, hear plainly. The other affections
which are within us, are in some cases useful. For instance, Anger is often useful. For (saith
he) “unjust wrath shall not be innocent” ( Ecclus. i. 22 ): wherefore it is possible for one to
be justly in wrath. And again, “He that is angry with his brother without cause,2765 shall be
in danger of hell.” ( Matt. v. 22.) Again for instance, emulation, desire, <del>are useful</del>: the one
when it hath reference to the procreation of children, the other when he directs his emulation
to excellent things. As Paul also saith, “It is good to be zealously affected always in a good
<note type="footnote">2765 [St. Chrys. here follows a text having the gloss εἰκῆ now rejected by nearly all critical editors.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="701"/>
thing” ( Gal. iv. 18 ) and, “Covet earnestly the best gifts.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 31.) Both therefore are
useful: but an insolent spirit is in no case good, but is always unprofitable and hurtful.</p>
<p>However, if a man must be proud, <del>let it be</del> for poverty, not for wealth. Wherefore?
Because he who can live upon a little, is far greater and better than he who cannot. For tell
me, supposing certain persons called to the Imperial City, if some of them should need
neither beasts, nor slaves, nor umbrellas, nor lodging-places, nor sandals, nor vessels, but
it should suffice them to have bread, and to take water from the wells,—while others of them
should say, “unless ye give us conveyances, and a soft bed, we cannot come; unless also we
have many followers, unless we may be allowed continually to rest ourselves, we cannot
come, nor unless we have the use of beasts, unless too we may travel but a small portion of
the day—and we have need of many other things also”: whom should we admire? those or
these? plainly, these who require nothing. So also here: some need many things for the
journey through this life; others, nothing. So that it would be more fitting to be proud, for
poverty if it were fitting at all.</p>
<p>“But the poor man,” they say, “is contemptible.” Not he, but those who despise him.
For why do not I despise those who know not how to admire what they ought? Why, if a
person be a painter, he will laugh to scorn all who jeer at him, so long as they are uninstructed;
nor doth he regard the things which they say, but is content with his own testimony. And
shall we depend on the opinion of the many? Therefore, we are worthy of contempt when
men despise us for our poverty, and we do not despise them nor call them miserable.</p>
<p>And I say not how many sins are produced by wealth, and how many good things by
poverty. But rather, neither wealth nor poverty is excellent in itself, but through those who
use it. The Christian shines out in poverty rather than in riches. How? He will be less arrogant,
more sober-minded, graver, more equitable, more considerate: but he that is in wealth, hath
many impediments to these things. Let us see then what the rich man does, or rather, he
who useth his wealth amiss. Such an one practiceth rapine, fraud, violence. Men’s unseemly
loves, unholy unions, witchcrafts, poisonings, all their other horrors,—wilt thou not find
them produced by wealth? Seest thou, that in poverty rather than in wealth the pursuit of
virtue is less laborious? For do not, I beseech thee, think that because rich men do not suffer
punishment here, neither do they sin. Since if it were easy for a rich man to suffer punishment,
thou wouldest surely have found the prisons filled with them. But among its other
evils, wealth hath this also, that he who possesseth it, transgressing in evil with impunity,
will never be stayed from doing so, but will receive wounds without remedies, and no man
will put a bridle on him.</p>
<p>And if a man choose, he will find that poverty affords us more resources even for
pleasure. How? Because it is freed from cares, hatred, fighting, contention, strife, from evils
out of number.</p>

<pb n="702"/>
<p>Therefore let us not follow after wealth, nor be forever envying those who possess much.
But let those of us who have wealth, use it aright; and those who have not, let us not grieve
for this, but give thanks for all things unto God, because He enableth us to receive with little
labor the same reward with the rich, or even (if we will) a greater: and from small means
we shall have great gains. For so he that brought the two talents, was admired and honored
equally with him who brought the five. Now why? Because he was entrusted with <del>but</del> two
talents, yet he accomplished all that in him lay, and brought in what was entrusted to him,
doubled. Why then are we eager to have much entrusted to us, when we may by a little reap
the same fruits, or even greater? when the labor indeed is less, but the reward much more?
For more easily will a poor man part with his own, than a rich man who hath many and
great possessions. What, know ye not, that the more things a man hath, the more he setteth
his love upon? Therefore, lest this befall us, let us not seek after wealth, nor let us be impatient
of poverty, nor make haste to be rich: and let those of us who have <del>riches</del> so use them as
Paul commanded. (“They that have,” saith he, “as though they had not, and they that use
this world as not abusing it”— 1 Cor. vii. 29, 31 ): that we may obtain the good things
promised. And may it be granted to us all to obtain them, by the grace and love of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor,
now, and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily III.</head>
<p>Hebrews i. 6–8</p>
<p>“And again when He bringeth in the First-Begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the
angels of God worship Him. And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His angels spirits,
and His ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son He saith, Thy throne, O God, is for
ever and ever.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Our Lord Jesus Christ calls His coming in the flesh an exodus <del>or going out</del>: as
when He saith, “The sower went out to sow.” ( Matt. xiii. 3.) And again, “I went out from
the Father, and am come.” ( John xvi. 28.) And in many places one may see this. But Paul
calls it an <del>eisodus or</del> coming in, saying, “And when again He bringeth in the First-Begotten
into the world,” meaning by this Bringing in, His taking on Him flesh.</p>
<p>Now why has he so used the expression? The things signified <del>thereby</del> are manifest,
and in what respect it is <del>thus</del> said. For Christ indeed calls it a Going out, justly; for we
were out from God. For as in royal palaces, prisoners and those who have offended the king,
stand without, and he who desires to reconcile them, does not bring them in, but himself
going out discourses with them, until having made them meet for the king’s presence, he
may bring them in, so also Christ hath done. Having gone out to us, that is, having taken
flesh, and having discoursed to us of the King’s matters, so He brought us in, having purged
the sins, and made reconciliation. Therefore he calls it a Going out.</p>
<p>But Paul names it a Coming in, from the metaphor of those who come to an inheritance
and receive any portion or possession. For the saying, “and when again He bringeth in the
First-Begotten into the world,” means this, “when he putteth the world into His hand.” For
when He was made known, then also He obtained possession of the whole thereof, He saith
not these things concerning God The Word, but concerning that which is according to the
flesh. For if according to John, “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him” (
John i. 10 ): how is He “brought in,” otherwise than in the flesh?</p>
<p>“And,” saith he, “Let all the angels of God worship Him.” Whereas he is about to say
something great and lofty, he prepares it beforehand, and makes it acceptable, in that he
represents the Father as “bringing in” the Son. He had said above, that “He spake to us not
by prophets but by His Son”; that the Son is superior to angels; yea and he establishes this
from the name [Son]. And here, in what follows, from another fact also. What then may
this be? From worship. And he shows how much greater He is, as much as a Master is than
a slave; just as any one introducing another into a house straightway commands those having
the care thereof to do him reverence; <del>so</del> saying in regard to the Flesh, “And let all the Angels
of God worship Him.”</p>

<pb n="704"/>
<p>Is it then Angels only? No; for hear what follows: “And of His Angels He saith, Which
maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire: but unto the Son, Thy Throne,
O God, is for ever and ever.” Behold, the greatest difference! that they are created, but He
uncreated. While of His angels He saith, who “maketh”; wherefore of the Son did He not
say “Who maketh”? Although he might have expressed the difference as follows: “Of His
Angels He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, but of the Son, ‘The Lord created Me’:
‘God hath made Him Lord and Christ.’” ( Prov. viii. 22; Acts ii. 36.) But neither was the one
spoken concerning the Son, nor the other concerning God The Word, but concerning the
flesh. For when he desired to express the true difference, he no longer included angels only,
but the whole ministering power above. Seest thou how he distinguishes, and with how
great clearness, between creatures and Creator, ministers and Lord, the Heir and true Son,
and slaves?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.” Behold a
symbol of Kingly Office. “A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Thy kingdom.” Behold
again another symbol of Royalty.</p>
<p>Then again with respect to the flesh ( ver. 9 ) “Thou hast loved righteousness and hated
iniquity, therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee.”</p>
<p>What is, “Thy God”? Why, after that he hath uttered a great word, he again qualifieth
it. Here he hits both Jews, and the followers of Paul of Samosata, and the Arians, and Marcellus,
and Sabellius, and Marcion. How? The Jews, by his indicating two Persons, both God
and Man;2766 the other Jews,2767 I mean the followers of Paul of Samosata, by thus discoursing
concerning His eternal existence, and uncreated essence: for by way of distinction,
against the word, “He made,” he put, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.” Against the
Arians there is both this same again, and also that He is not a slave; but if a creature, He is
a slave. And against Marcellus and the others, that these are two Persons, distinguished in
reference to their subsistence. 2768 And against the Marcionites, that the Godhead is not
anointed, but the Manhood.</p>
<p>Next he saith, “Above Thy fellows.” But who are these His “fellows” other than men?
that is Christ received “not the Spirit by measure.” ( John iii. 34.) Seest thou how with the
<note type="footnote">2766 δυὸ πρόσωπα δεικνὺς, καὶ Θεὸν καὶ ἄνθρωπον. That is both two distinct Persons in the Godhead, and
also the Divine and human natures of the Christ. The corrector would seem to have understood it “two Persons,
both God and man” ; the common texts read δυὸ τὸν αὐτὸν δεικνὺς, κ. θ. κ. ἀ “showing the same [Person] to
be two, both God and man.” [The first καὶ may well be translated both. It seems to have been omitted by the
corrector simply as superfluous, not as altering the sense.—F.G.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2767 Sav. and Ben. omit ̓ Ιουδαίους. The teaching of Paul of Samosata was regarded as closely connected with
Judaism, and he and his followers were called Jews.</note>
<note type="footnote">2768 κατὰ τὴν ὑπόστασιν, see above, pp. 370, 371, notes.</note>

<pb n="705"/>
doctrine concerning His uncreated nature he always joins also that of the “Economy”? what
can be clearer than this? Didst thou see how what is created and what is begotten are not
the same? For otherwise he would not have made the distinction, nor in contrast to the
word, “He made” <del>U+0026c. </del>, have added, “But unto the Son He said, Thy throne, O God, is for
ever and ever.” Nor would he have called the name, “Son, a more excellent Name,” if it is a
sign of the same thing. For what is the excellence? For if that which is created, and that
which is begotten be the same, and they <del>the Angels</del> were made, what is there <del>in Him</del>
“more excellent”? Lo! again ὁ Θεὸς, “God,” with the Article.2769</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And again he saith ( ver. 10–12 ): “Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands. They shall perish,
but Thou remainest, and they shall all wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou
fold them up, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same and Thy years shall not fail.”</p>
<p>Lest hearing the words, “and when He bringeth in the First-Begotten into the world”;
thou shouldest think it as it were a Gift afterwards super-added to Him; above, he both
corrected this beforehand, and again further corrects, saying, “in the beginning”: not now,
but from the first. See again he strikes both Paul of Samosata and also Arius a mortal blow,
applying to the Son the things which relate to the Father. And withal he has also intimated
another thing by the way, greater even than this. For surely he hath incidentally pointed out
also the transfiguration of the world, saying, “they shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture
Thou shalt fold them up, and they shall be changed.” Which also he saith in the Epistle to
the Romans, that he shall transfigure the world. (See Rom. viii. 21.) And showing the facility
thereof, he adds, as if a man should fold up a garment so shall He both fold up and change
it. But if He with so much ease works the transfiguration and the creation to what is better
and more perfect, needed He another for the inferior creation? How far doth your shamelessness
go? At the same time too this is a very great consolation, to know that things will
not be as they are, but they all shall receive change, and all shall be altered, but He Himself
remaineth ever existing, and living without end: “and Thy years,” he saith, “shall not fail.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 13. “But to which of the Angels said He at any time, Sit thou on My right hand
until I make thine enemies thy footstool?” Behold, again he encourages them, inasmuch as
their enemies were to be worsted, and their enemies are the same also with Christ’s.</p>
<p>This again belongs to Sovereignty, to Equal Dignity, to Honor and not weakness, that
the Father should be angry for the things done to the Son. This belongs to His great Love
and honor towards the Son, as of a father towards a son. For He that is angry in His behalf
<note type="footnote">2769 The Ben. editor observes that it had been said that ὁ θεός with the article is used in Scripture only of the
Father, and that St. Chrys. here as in other places argues that it is used of the Son.</note>

<pb n="706"/>
how is He a stranger to Him? Which also he saith in the second Psalm, “He that dwelleth
in heaven shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall
He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure.” ( Ps. ii. 4, 5.) And
again He Himself saith, “Those that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither
before Me, and slay them.” ( Luke xix. 27.) For that they are His own words, hear also what
He saith in another place, “How often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye
would not! Behold, your house is left desolate.” ( Luke xiii. 34, 35.) And again, “The kingdom
shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (
Matt. xxi. 43.) And again, “He that falleth upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever
It shall fall, It will grind him to powder.” ( Matt. xxi. 44.) And besides, He who is to be
their Judge in that world, much more did He Himself repay them in this. So that the words
“Till I make thine enemies thy footstool” are expressive of honor only towards the Son.</p>
<p>Ver. 14. “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation?” What marvel (saith he) if they minister to the Son, when they minister
even to our salvation? See how he lifts up their minds, and shows the great honor which
God has for us, since He has assigned to Angels who are above us this ministration on our
behalf. As if one should say, for this purpose (saith he) He employs them; this is the office
of Angels, to minister to God for our salvation. So that it is an angelical work, to do all for
the salvation of the brethren: or rather it is the work of Christ Himself, for He indeed saves
as Lord, but they as servants. And we, though servants are yet Angels’ fellow-servants. Why
gaze ye so earnestly on the Angels (saith he)? They are servants of the Son of God, and are
sent many ways for our sakes, and minister to our salvation. And so they are partners in
service with us.</p>
<p>Consider ye how he ascribes no great difference to the kinds of creatures. And yet the
space between angels and men is great; nevertheless he brings them down near to us, all but
saying, For us they labor, for our sake they run to and fro: on us, as one might say, they wait.
This is their ministry, for our sake to be sent every way.</p>
<p>And of these examples both the Old <del>Testament</del> is full, and the New. For when Angels
bring glad tidings to the shepherds, or to Mary, or to Joseph; when they sit at the sepulcher,
when they are sent to say to the disciples, “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven?” ( Acts i. 11 ), when they release Peter out of the prison, when they discourse with
Philip, consider how great the honor is; when God sends His Angels for ministers as to
friends; when to Cornelius [an Angel] appears, when <del>an Angel</del> brings forth all the apostles
from the prison, and says, “Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people the words of
this life” ( Acts v. 20 ); and to Paul himself also an Angel appears. Dost thou see that they
minister to us on God’s behalf, and that they minister to us in the greatest matters? wherefore
Paul saith, “All things are yours, whether life or death, or the world, or things present, or
things to come.” ( 1 Cor. iii. 22.)</p>

<pb n="707"/>
<p>Well then the Son also was sent, but not as a servant, nor as a minister, but as a Son,
and Only-Begotten, and desiring the same things with the Father. Rather indeed, He was
not “sent”: for He did not pass from place to place, but took on Him flesh: whereas these
change their places, and leaving those in which they were before, so come to others in which
they were not.</p>
<p>And by this again he incidentally encourages them, saying, What fear ye? Angels are
ministering to us.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And having spoken concerning the Son, both what related to the Economy, and
what related to the Creation, and to His sovereignty, and having shown His co-equal dignity,
and that as absolute Master He ruleth not men only but also the powers above, he next exhorts
them, having made out his argument, that we ought to give heed to the things which have
been heard. ( c. ii. 1.) “Wherefore we ought to give more earnest heed” (saith he) “to the
things which we have heard.” Why “more earnest”? Here he meant “more earnest” than to
the Law: but he suppressed the actual expression of it, and yet makes it plain in the course
of reasoning, not in the way of counsel, nor of exhortation. For so it was better.</p>
<p>Ver. 2, 3. “For if the word spoken by Angels” (saith he) “was steadfast, and every transgression
and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape if we
neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken to us by the Lord, and was
confirmed unto us by them that heard Him?”</p>
<p>Why ought we to “give more earnest heed to the things which we have heard”? were
not those former things of God, as well as these? Either then he meaneth “more earnest”
than <del>to</del> the Law, or “very earnest”; not making comparison, God forbid. For since, on account
of the long space of time, they had a great opinion of the Old Covenant, but these
things had been despised as yet new, he proves (more than his argument required) that we
ought rather to give heed to these. How? By saying in effect, Both these and those are of
God, but not in a like manner. And this he shows us afterwards: but for the present he treats
it somewhat superficially, but afterwards more clearly, saying “For if that first covenant had
been faultless” ( c. viii. 7 ), and many other such things: “for that which decayeth and waxeth
old is ready to vanish away.” ( c. viii. 13.) But as yet he ventures not to say any such thing
in the beginning of his discourse, nor until he shall have first occupied and possessed his
hearer by his fuller <del>arguments</del>.</p>
<p>Why then ought we “to give more earnest heed”? “Lest at any time,” saith he, “we should
let them slip”—that is, lest at any time we should perish, lest we should fall away. And here
he shows the grievousness of this falling away, in that it is a difficult thing for that which
hath fallen away to return again, inasmuch as it hath happened through wilful negligence.
And he took this form of speech from the Proverbs. For, saith he, “my son <del>take heed</del> lest
thou fall away” ( Prov. iii. 21 , LXX.), showing both the easiness of the fall, and the grievousness
of the ruin. That is, our disobedience is not without danger. And while by his mode of

<pb n="708"/>
reasoning he shows that the chastisement is greater, yet again he leaves it in the form of a
question, and not in the conclusion. For indeed this is to make one’s discourse inoffensive,
when one does not in every case of one’s self infer the judgment, but leaves it in the power
of the hearer himself to give sentence: and this would render them more open to conviction.
And both the prophet Nathan doth the same in the Old [Testament], and in Matthew Christ,
saying, “What will He do to the husbandmen” ( Matt. xxi. 40 ) of that vineyard? so compelling
them to give sentence themselves: for this is the greatest victory.</p>
<p>Next, when he had said, “For if the word which was spoken by Angels was steadfast”—he
did not add, much more that by Christ: but letting this pass, he said what is less, “How shall
we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?” And see how he makes the comparison. “For if
the word which was spoken by Angels,” saith he. There, “by Angels,” here, “by the Lord”—and
there “a word,” but here, “salvation.”</p>
<p>Then lest any man should say, Thy sayings, O Paul, are they Christ’s? he proves their
trustworthiness both from his having heard these things of Him, and from their being now
spoken by God; since not merely a voice is wafted, as in the case of Moses, but signs are
done, and facts bear witness.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> But what is this, “For if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast”? For in the Epistle
to the Galatians also he saith to this effect, “Being ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator.”
( Gal. iii. 19.) And again, “Ye received a law by the disposition of Angels, and have
not kept it.” ( Acts vii. 53.) And everywhere he saith it was given by angels. Some indeed
say that Moses is signified; but without reason. For here he says Angels in the plural: and
the Angels too which he here speaks of, are those in Heaven. What then is it? Either he
means the Decalogue only (for there Moses spake, and God answered him— Ex. xix. 19
),—or that angels were present, God disposing them in order,—or that he speaks thus in
regard of all things said and done in the old Covenant, as if Angels had part in them. But
how is it said in another place, “The Law was given by Moses” ( John i. 17 ), and here “by
Angels”? For it is said, “And God came down in thick darkness.”2770 ( Ex. xix. 16, 20.)</p>
<p>“For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast.” What is “was steadfast”? True, as one
may say; and faithful in its proper season; and all the things which had been spoken came
to pass. Either this is his meaning, or that they prevailed, and the threatenings were coming
to be accomplished. Or by “the word” he means injunctions. For apart from the Law, Angels
sent from God enjoined many things: for instance at Bochim, in the Judges, in <del>the history
of</del> Samson. ( Judg. ii. 1; xiii. 3.) For this is the cause why he said not “the Law” but “the
word.” And he seems to me haply rather to mean this, viz., those things which are committed
<note type="footnote">2770 This last clause seems unconnected as it stands here. If there were ms. authority one should be glad to
transfer it a few lines lower, after the management of Angels: τὰ διὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων οἰκονομηθέντα, or to place
here the words “What shall we say,” down to “ thick darkness.”</note>

<pb n="709"/>
to the management of angels. What shall we say then? The angels who were entrusted with
the charge of the nation were then present, and they themselves made the trumpets, and
the other things, the fire, the thick darkness. ( Ex. xix. 16.)</p>
<p>“And every transgression and disobedience,” saith he. Not this one and that one, but
“every” one. Nothing, he saith, remained unavenged, but “received a just recompense of
reward,” instead of [saying] punishment. Why now spake he thus? Such is the manner of
Paul, not to make much account of his phrases, but indifferently to put down words of evil
sound, even in matters of good meaning. As also in another place he saith, “Bringing into
captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”2771 ( 2 Cor. x. 5.) And again he hath
put “the recompense” for punishment,2772 as here he calleth punishment “reward.” “If it
be a righteous thing,” he saith, “with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble
you, and to you who are troubled rest.” ( 2 Thess. i. 6, 7.) That is, justice was not violated,
but God went forth against them, and caused the penalty to come round on the sinners,
though not all their sins are made manifest, but only where the express ordinances were
transgressed.</p>
<p>“How then shall we,” he saith, “escape if we neglect so great salvation?” Hereby he signified,
that other salvation was no great thing. Well too did he add the “So great.” For not
from wars (he saith) will He now rescue us, nor bestow on us the earth and the good things
that are in the earth, but it will be the dissolution of death, the destruction of the devil, the
kingdom of Heaven, everlasting life. For all these things he hath briefly expressed, by saying,
“if we neglect so great salvation.”</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Then he subjoins what makes this worthy of belief. “Which at the first began to be
spoken by the Lord”: that is, had its beginning from the fountain itself. It was not a man
who brought it over2773 into the earth, nor any created power, but the Only-Begotten
Himself.</p>
<note type="footnote">2771 See St. Chrys. on the passage, 2 Cor. x. 5 [p. 242, O.T.]. The expression “captivity” was the “word of evil

<p>“And was confirmed unto us by them that heard <del>Him</del>.” What is “confirmed”? It was
believed,2774 or, it came to pass. For (he saith) we have the earnest;2775 that is, it hath not
been extinguished, it hath not ceased, but it is strong and prevaileth. And the cause is, the
Divine power works therein. It means they who heard from the Lord, themselves confirmed
us. This is a great thing and trustworthy: which also Luke saith in the beginning of his
Gospel, “As they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers
of the Word.” ( Luke i. 2.)</p>
<p>How then was it confirmed? What if those that heard were forgers? saith some one.
This objection then he overthrows, and shows that the grace was not human. If they had
gone astray, God would not have borne witness to them; for he subjoined ( ver. 4 ), “God
also bearing witness with them.” Both they indeed bear witness, and God beareth witness
too. How doth He bear witness? not by word or by voice, (though this also would have been
worthy of belief): but how? “By signs, and wonders, and divers miracles.” (Well said he,
“divers miracles,” declaring the abundance of the gifts: which was not so in the former dispensation,
neither so great signs and so various.) That is, we did not believe them simply,
but through signs and wonders: wherefore we believe not them, but God Himself.</p>
<p>“And by gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will.”</p>
<p>What then, if wizards also do signs, and the Jews said that He “cast out devils through
Beelzebub”? ( Luke xi. 15.) But they do not such kind of signs: therefore said he “divers
miracles”: for those others were not miracles, <del>or powers,2776</del> but weakness and fancy, and
things altogether vain. Wherefore he said, “by gifts of the Holy Ghost according to His own
will.”</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Here he seems to me to intimate something further. For it is not likely there were
many there who had gifts, but that these had failed, upon their becoming more slothful. In
order then that even in this he might comfort them, and not leave them to fall away, he referred
all to the will of God. He knows (he says) what is expedient, and for whom, and apportions
His grace accordingly. Which also he <del>Paul</del> does in the Epistle to the Corinthians,
saying, “God hath set every one of us, as it pleased Him.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 18.) And again, “The
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 7.)</p>
<p>“According to His will.” He shows that the gift is according to the will of the Father.
But oftentimes on account of their unclean and slothful life many have not received a gift,
<note type="footnote">2774 ἐ πιστεύθη. Dunæus suggested ἐ πιστώθη, “it was accredited,” but there is no ms. authority for the
change.</note>
<note type="footnote">2775 St. Chrys. seems to have had in view 2 Cor. i. 21, 22 , where “confirming” is connected with the earnest
of “the Spirit.” [The passage is, “how he which stablishes us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;
who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” —F.G.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2776 δυνάμεις</note>

<pb n="711"/>
and sometimes also those whose life is good and pure have not received one. Why, I pray
you? Lest they might be made haughty, that they might not be puffed up, that they might
not grow more negligent, that they might not be more excited. For if even without a gift,
the mere consciousness of a pure life be sufficient to lift a man up, much more when the
grace is added also. Wherefore to the humble, to the simple, it was rather given, and especially
to the simple: for it is said, “in singleness and gladness of heart.” ( Acts ii. 46.) Yea, and
hereby also he rather urged them on, and if they were growing negligent gave them a spur.
For the humble, and he who imagines no great things concerning himself, becomes more
earnest when he has received a gift, in that he has obtained what is beyond his deserts, and
thinks that he is not worthy thereof. But he who thinks he hath done well, reckoning it to
be his due, is puffed up. Wherefore God dispenseth this profitably: which one may see taking
place also in the Church: for one hath the word of teaching, another hath not power to open
his mouth. Let not this man (he says) be grieved because of this. For “the manifestation of
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 7.) For if a man that is an
householder knoweth to whom he should entrust anything, much more God, who understands
the mind of men, “who knoweth all things or ever they come into being.”2777 One
thing only is worthy of grief, Sin: there is nothing else.</p>
<p>Say not, Wherefore have I not riches? or, If I had, I would give to the poor. Thou
knowest not, if thou hadst them, whether thou wouldest not the rather be covetous. For
now indeed thou sayest these things, but being put to the trial thou wouldest be different.
Since also when we are satisfied, we think that we are able to fast; but when we have gone
without a little space, other thoughts come into us. Again, when we are out of the way of
strong drink, we think ourselves able to master our appetite, but no longer so, when we are
caught by it.</p>
<p>Say not, Wherefore had I not the gift of teaching? or, If I had it, I should have edified
innumerable souls. Thou knowest not, if thou hadst it, whether it would not be to thy condemnation,—
whether envy, whether sloth, would not have disposed thee to hide thy talent.
Now, indeed, thou art now free from all these, and though thou give not “the portion of
meat” ( Luke xii. 42 ), thou art not called to account: but then, thou wouldest have been responsible
for many.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> And besides, neither now art thou without the gift. Show in the little, what thou
wouldst have been, if thou hadst had the other. “For if” (he says) “ye are not faithful in that
which is little, how shall any one give you that which is great?” ( Luke xvi. 11.) Give such
proof as did the widow; she had two farthings,2778 and she cast in all, whatsoever she possessed.</p>
<note type="footnote">2777 Hist. Sus . 42</note>

<pb n="712"/>
<p>Dost thou seek riches? Prove that thou thinkest lightly of the few things, that I may trust
thee also concerning the many things. But if thou dost not think lightly even of these, much
less wilt thou do so of the other.</p>
<p>Again, in speech, prove that thou canst use fitly exhortation and counsel. Hast thou not
external eloquence? hast thou not store of thoughts? But nevertheless thou knowest these
common things. Thou hast a child, thou hast a neighbor, thou hast a friend, thou hast a
brother, thou hast kinsmen. And though publicly before the Church, thou art not able to
draw out a long discourse, these thou canst exhort in private. Here, there is no need of
rhetoric, nor of elaborate discourse: prove in these, that if thou hadst skill of speech, thou
wouldest not have neglected it. But if in the small matter thou art not in earnest, how shall
I trust thee concerning the great?</p>
<p>For, that every man can do this, hear what Paul saith, how he charged even lay people;
“Edify,” he says, “one another, as also ye do.” ( 1 Thess. v. 11.) And, “Comfort one another
with these words.” ( 1 Thess. iv. 18.) God knoweth how He should distribute to every man.
Art thou better than Moses? hear how he shrinks from the hardship. “Am I,” saith he, “able
to bear them? for Thou saidst to me, Bear them up, as a nursing-father would bear up the
sucking-child.” ( Num. xi. 12.) What then did God? He took of his spirit and gave unto the
others, showing that neither when he bare them was the gift his own, but of the Spirit. If
thou hadst had the gift, thou wouldst perchance2779 have been lifted up, perchance wouldst
thou have been turned out of the way. Thou knowest not thyself as God knoweth thee. Let
us not say, To what end is that? on what account is this? When God dispenseth, let us not
demand an account of Him: for this [is] of the uttermost impiety and folly. We are slaves,
and slaves far apart from our Master, knowing not even the things which are before us.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> Let us not then busy ourselves about the counsel of God, but whatsoever He hath
given, this let us guard, though it be small, though it be the lowest, and we shall be altogether
approved. Or rather, none of the gifts of God is small: art thou grieved because thou hast
not the gift of teaching? Then tell me, which seems to you the greater, to have the gift of
teaching, or the gift of driving away diseases? Doubtless the latter. But what? Tell me; doth
it not seem to thee greater to give eyes to the blind than even to drive away diseases? But
what? Tell me; doth it not seem to thee greater to raise the dead than to give eyes to the
blind? What again, tell me; doth it not seem to thee greater to do this by shadows and napkins,
than by a word? Tell me then, which wouldst thou? Raise the dead with shadows and napkins,
or have the gift of teaching? Doubtless thou wilt say the former, to raise the dead with
shadows and napkins. If then I should show to thee, that there is another gift far greater
than this, and that thou dost not receive it when it is in thy power to receive it, art not thou
justly deprived of those others? And this gift not one or two, but all may have. I know that
<note type="footnote">2779 πολλάκις, see Mr. Field’s note.</note>

<pb n="713"/>
ye open wide your mouths and are amazed, at being to hear that it is in your power to have
a greater gift than raising the dead, and giving eyes to the blind, doing the same things which
were done in the time of the Apostles. And it seems to you past belief.</p>
<p>What then is this gift? charity. Nay, believe me; for the word is not mine, but Christ’s
speaking by Paul. For what saith he? “Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you
a more excellent way.” ( 1 Cor. xii. 31.) What is this, “yet more excellent”? What he means
is this. The Corinthians were proud over their gifts, and those having tongues, the least gift,
were puffed up against the rest. He saith therefore, Do ye by all means desire gifts? I show
unto you a way of gifts not merely excelling but far more excellent. Then he saith, “Though
I speak with the tongues of Angels, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I have
faith so as to remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.” ( 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2.)</p>
<p>Hast thou seen the gift? Covet earnestly this gift. This is greater than raising the dead.
This is far better than all the rest. And that it is so, hear what Christ Himself saith, discoursing
with His disciples, “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples.” ( John xiii. 35.) And
showing how, He mentioned not the miracles, but what? “If ye have love one with another.”
And again He saith to the Father, “Hereby shall they know that Thou hast sent Me, if they
be one.” ( John xvii. 21.) And He said to His disciples, “A new commandment I give to you,
that ye love one another.” ( John xiii. 34.) Such an one therefore is more venerable and
glorious than those who raise the dead; with reason. For that indeed is wholly of God’s grace,
but this, of thine own earnestness also. This is of one who is a Christian indeed: this shows
the disciple of Christ, the crucified, the man that hath nothing common with earth. Without
this, not even martyrdom can profit.</p>
<p>And as a proof, see this plainly. The blessed Paul took two of the highest virtues, or
rather three; namely, those which consist in miracles, in knowledge, in life. And without
this the others, he said, are nothing. And I will say how these are nothing. “Though I give
my goods to feed the poor,” he says, “and have not charity, I am nothing.” ( 1 Cor. xiii. 3.)
For it is possible not to be charitable even when one feeds the poor and exhausts one’s means.</p>
<p><del>11.</del> And indeed these things have been sufficiently declared by us, in the place concerning
Charity:2780 and thither we refer the readers. Meanwhile, as I was saying, let us covet
earnestly the Gift, let us love one another; and we shall need nothing else for the perfect
acquisition of virtue, but all will be easy to us without toils and we shall do all perfectly with
much diligence.</p>
<p>But see, even now, it is said, we love one another. For one man hath two friends, and
another three. But this is not to love for God’s sake, but for the sake of being beloved. But
to love for God’s sake hath not this as its principle of Love; but such an one will be disposed
towards all men as towards brethren; loving those that are of the same faith as being true
<note type="footnote">2780 His Homily on 1 Cor. xiii. 3 [pp. 444 sqq. O.T.] is referred to.</note>

<pb n="714"/>
brothers; heretics and Heathen and Jews, brothers indeed by nature, but vile and unprofitable,—
pitying and wearing himself out and weeping for them. Herein we shall be like God
if we love all men, even our enemies; not, if we work miracles. For we regard even God with
admiration when He worketh wonders, yet much more, when He showeth love towards
man, when He is long-suffering. If then even in God this is worthy of much admiration,
much more in men is it evident that this rendereth us admirable.</p>
<p>This then let us zealously seek after: and we shall be no way inferior to Paul and Peter
and those who have raised innumerable dead, though we may not be able to drive away a
fever. But without this <del>Love</del>; though we should work greater miracles even than the Apostles
themselves, though we should expose ourselves to innumerable dangers for the faith: there
will be to us no profit from any. And these things it is not I that say, but he, the very nourisher
of Charity, knoweth these things. To him then let us be obedient; for thus we shall be
able to attain to the good things promised, of which may we all be made partakers, by the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father with the Holy Ghost, be the glory,
now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily IV.</head>
<p>Hebrews ii. 5–7</p>
<p>“For unto Angels He hath not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one
in a certain place testified, saying, What is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son
of man that Thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the Angels.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> I could have wished to know for certain whether any hear with fitting earnestness
the things that are said, whether we are not casting the seeds by the wayside: for in that case
I should have made my instructions with more cheerfulness. For we shall speak, though no
one hear, for the fear which is laid on us by our Saviour. For, saith He, testify to this people;
even if they hear not, thou shalt thyself be guiltless. (See Ezek. iii. 19.) If however I had been
persuaded of your earnestness, I should have spoken not for fear only, but should have done
it with pleasure also. For now indeed, even if no man hear, even if my work, so long as I
fulfill my own part, brings no danger, still the labor is not altogether pleasant. For what
profit is it, when though I be not blamed, yet no one is benefited? But if any would give heed
we shall receive advantage not so much from avoiding punishment ourselves as from your
progress.</p>
<p>How then shall I know this? Having taken notice of some of you, who are not very attentive,
I shall question them privately, when I meet them. And if I find that they retain any
of the things that have been spoken (I say not all, for this would not be very easy for you),
but even if <del>they retain</del> a few things out of many, it is plain I should have no further doubts
about the rest. And indeed we ought, without giving notice beforehand, to have attacked
you when off your guard. However it will suffice, if even in this way I should be able to attain
my purpose. Nay rather, even as it is, I can attack you when you are off your guard. For that
I shall question you, I have forewarned you; but when I shall question you I do not as yet
make evident. For perhaps it may be to-day; perhaps to-morrow, perhaps after twenty or
thirty days, perhaps after fewer, perhaps after more. Thus has God also made uncertain the
day of our death. Nor hath He allowed it be clear to us, whether it shall befall us to-day, or
to-morrow, or after a whole year, or after many years; that through the uncertainty of the
expectation we may through all time keep ourselves firm in virtue. And that we shall indeed
depart, He hath said,—but when, He hath not yet said. Thus too I have said that I shall
question you, but I have not added when, wishing you always to be thoughtful.</p>
<p>And let no man say, I heard these things four or five weeks ago, or more, and I cannot
retain them. For I wish the hearer so to retain them as to have his recollection perpetual
and not apt to fade, nor yet that he should disown what is spoken. For I wish you to retain
them, not, in order to tell them to me, but that ye may have profit; and this is of most serious
interest to me. Let no one then say this.</p>

<pb n="716"/>
<p><del>2.</del> However, I must now begin with what follows in the epistle. What then is set before
us to speak on to-day?</p>
<p>“For not to angels,” he says, “did He put in subjection the world to come,2781 whereof
we speak.” Is he then discoursing concerning some other world? No, but concerning this.
Therefore he added “whereof we speak,” that he might not allow the mind to wander away
in search of some other. How then does he call it “the world to come”? Exactly as he also
says in another place, “Who is the figure of him that was to come,”2782 ( Rom. v. 14 ,) when
he is speaking about Adam and Christ in the Epistle to the Romans; calling Christ according
to the flesh “Him that was to come” in respect of the times of Adam, (for [then] He was to
come). So now also, since he had said, “but when he bringeth in the First-Begotten into the
world”: that thou mightest not suppose that he is speaking of another world, it is made
certain from many considerations and from his saying “to come.” For the world was to
come, but the Son of God always was. This world then which was about to come, He put in
subjection not to Angels but to Christ. For that this is spoken with reference to the Son (he
says) is evident: for surely no one would assert the other alternative, that it had reference to
Angels.</p>
<p>Then he brings forward another testimony also and says, “but one in a certain place
testified, saying.” Wherefore did he not mention the name of the prophet, but hid it? Yea,
and in other testimonies also he doth this: as when he saith, “but when He bringeth in again
the First-Begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the Angels of God worship Him. And
again, I will be to Him a Father. And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His angels spirits.
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth” ( c. i. 6, 5, 7, 10
):—so also here he saith, “but one in a certain place testified, saying.” And this very thing (I
conceive) is the act of one that conceals himself, and shows that they were well skilled in
the Scriptures; his not setting down him who uttered the testimony, but introducing it as
familiar and obvious.</p>
<p>“What is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him?
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels: Thou crownedst him with glory and honor.”
2783 ( Ver. 8.) “Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.”</p>
<p>Now although these things were spoken of human nature generally, they would nevertheless
apply more properly to Christ according to the flesh. For this, “Thou hast put all
things in subjection under his feet,” belongs to Him rather than to us. For the Son of God
<note type="footnote">2781 τὴν μέλλουσαν</note>

<pb n="717"/>
visited us when we were nothing: and after having assumed our <del>nature</del>,2784 and united it
to Himself, He became higher than all.</p>
<p>“For,” he says, “in that He hath put all things in subjection under Him, He left nothing
not put under Him: but now we see not yet all things put under Him.” What he means is
this:—since he had said, “Until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool” ( c. i. 13 ),—and it was
likely that they would still be grieved,—then having inserted a few things after this parenthetically,
he added this testimony in confirmation of the former. For that they might not
say, How is it that He hath put His enemies under His feet, when we have suffered so much?
he sufficiently hinted at it in the former place indeed (for the word “until” showed, not what
should take place immediately, but in course of time) but here he followeth it up. For do
not suppose (he says) that because they have not yet been made subject, they are not to be
made subject: for that they must be made subject, is evident; for, on this account was the
prophecy spoken. “For,” he says, “in that He hath put all things under Him, He left nothing
not put under Him.” How then is it that all things have not been put under Him? Because
they are hereafter to be put under Him.</p>
<p>If then all things must be made subject to Him, but have not yet been made subject, do
not grieve, nor trouble thyself. If indeed when the end were come, and all things were made
subject, thou wert still suffering these things, with reason wouldst thou repine: “But now
we see not yet all things put under Him.” The King has not yet clearly conquered. Why then
art thou troubled when suffering affliction? the preaching <del>of the Gospel</del> hath not yet prevailed
over all; it is not yet time that they should be altogether made subject.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Then again there is another consolation if indeed He who is hereafter to have all
put in subjection under Him, hath Himself also died and submitted to sufferings innumerable.
( Ver. 9.) “But,” he says, “we see Him who was made a little2785 lower than the angels, even
Jesus, for the suffering of death”—then the good things again,—“crowned with glory and
honor.” Seest thou, how all things apply to Him? For the <del>expression</del>, “a little,” would rather
suit Him, who was only three days in Hades, but not ourselves who are for a long time in
corruption. Likewise also the <del>expression</del> “with glory and honor” will suit Him much more
than us.</p>
<p>Again, he reminds them of the Cross, thereby effecting two things; both showing His
care <del>for them</del> and persuading them to bear all things nobly, looking to the Master. For
(he would say) if He who is worshiped of Angels, for thy sake endured to have a little less
than the Angels, much more oughtest thou who art inferior to the Angels, to bear all things
for His sake. Then he shows that the Cross is “glory and honor,” as He Himself also always
calls it, saying, “That the Son of Man might be glorified” ( John xi. 5 ); and, “the Son of Man
<note type="footnote">2784 τὸ ἐξ ἡμῶν</note>
<note type="footnote">2785 or, “for a short time.”</note>

<pb n="718"/>
is glorified.” ( John xii. 23.) If then He calls the <del>sufferings</del> for His servants’ sake “glory,”
much more shouldest thou the <del>sufferings</del> for the Lord.</p>
<p>Seest thou the fruit of the Cross, how great it is? fear not the matter: for it seemeth to
thee indeed to be dismal, but it brings forth good things innumerable. From these considerations
he shows the benefit of trial. Then he says, “That He by the grace of God should taste
death for every man.”</p>
<p>“That by the grace of God,” he says. And He indeed because of the grace of God towards
us suffered these things. “He who spared not His Own Son,” he says, “but delivered Him
up for us all.” ( Rom. viii. 32.) Why? He did not owe us this, but has done it of grace. And
again in the Epistle to the Romans he says, “Much more the grace of God, and the gift by
grace which is by one man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.” ( Rom. v. 15.)</p>
<p>“That by the grace of God He should taste death for every man,” not for the faithful
only, but even for the whole world: for He indeed died for all; But what if all have not believed?
He hath fulfilled His own <del>part</del>.</p>
<p>Moreover he said rightly “taste death for every man,” he did not say “die.” For as if He
really was tasting it, when He had spent a little time therein, He immediately arose.</p>
<p>By saying then “for the suffering of death,” he signified real death, and by saying “superior
to angels,” he declared the resurrection. For as a physician though not needing to taste
the food prepared for the sick man, yet in his care for him tastes first himself, that he may
persuade the sick man with confidence to venture on the food, so since all men were afraid
of death, in persuading them to take courage against death, He tasted it also Himself though
He needed not. “For,” He says, “the prince of this world cometh and findeth nothing in
Me.” ( John xiv. 30.) So both the words “by grace” and “should taste death for every man,”
establish this.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 10. “For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through
sufferings.” He speaks here of the Father. Seest thou how again he applies the <del>expression</del>
“by whom”2786 to Him? Which he would not have done, had it been <del>an expression</del> of inferiority,
and only applicable to the Son. And what he says is this:—He has done what is
worthy of His love towards mankind, in showing His First-born to be more glorious than
all, and in setting Him forth as an example to the others, like some noble wrestler that surpasses
the rest.</p>
<p>“The Captain of their salvation,” that is, the Cause of their salvation. Seest thou how
great is the space between? Both He is a Son, and we are sons; but He saves, we are saved.
Seest thou how He both brings us together and then separates us; “bringing,” he says, “many
<note type="footnote">2786 δἰ οὗ, see above, note 4, p. 366.</note>

<pb n="719"/>
sons unto glory”: here he brings us together,—“the Captain of their salvation,” again he
separates.</p>
<p>“To make perfect through sufferings.”2787 Then sufferings are a perfecting, and a cause
of salvation. Seest thou that to suffer affliction is not the portion of those who are utterly
forsaken; if indeed it was by this that God first honored His Son, by leading Him through
sufferings? And truly His taking flesh to suffer what He did suffer, is a far greater thing than
making the world, and bringing it out of things that are not. This indeed also is <del>a token</del>
of His loving-kindness, but the other far more. And <del>the Apostle</del> himself also pointing out
this very thing, says, “That in the ages to come He might show forth the exceeding riches
of His goodness, He both raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly
places in Christ Jesus.” ( Eph. ii. 7, 6.)</p>
<p>“For it became Him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing
many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” For
(he means) it became Him who taketh tender care, and brought all things into being, to give
up the Son for the salvation of the rest, the One for the many. However he did not express
himself thus, but, “to make perfect through sufferings,” showing the suffering for any one,
not merely profits “him,” but he himself also becomes more glorious and more perfect. And
this too he says in reference to the faithful, comforting them by the way: for Christ was
glorified then when He suffered. But when I say, He was glorified, do not suppose that there
was an accession of glory to Him: for that which is of nature He always had, and received
nothing in addition.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> “For,” he says, “both He that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one,
for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.” Behold again how he brings
<del>them</del> together, honoring and comforting them, and making them brethren of Christ, in
this respect that they are “of one.”2788 Then again guarding himself and showing that he is
speaking of that which is according to the flesh, he introduces, “For He who sanctifieth,”
<del>i.e.</del> Christ, “and they who are sanctified,” ourselves. Dost thou see how great is the difference?
2789 He sanctifies, we are sanctified. And above he said, “the Captain of their salvation.
For there is one God, of whom are all things.”2790 ( 1 Cor. viii. 6.)</p>
<p>“For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.” Seest thou how again he
shows the superiority? For by saying, “He is not ashamed,” he shows that the whole comes
not of the nature of the thing, but of the loving affection of Him who was “not ashamed” of
<note type="footnote">2787 suffering perfects and works salvation.</note>
<note type="footnote">2788 ἐ ξ ἑνὸς</note>

<note type="footnote">2790 This citation is connected with “they are of one,” the intervening words, “Then again…salvation,” being

<pb n="720"/>
anything, <del>yea</del> of His great humility. For though we be “of one,” yet He sanctifieth and we
are sanctified: and great is the difference.2791 Moreover “He” is of the Father, as a true Son,
that is, of His substance; “we,” as created, that is, brought out of things that are not, so that
the difference is great. Wherefore he says, “He is not ashamed to call them brethren” ( ver.
12 ), “saying, I will declare Thy name unto My brethren.” ( Ps. xxii. 22.) For when He clothed
Himself with flesh, He clothed Himself also with the brotherhood, and at the same time
came in the brotherhood.</p>
<p>This indeed he brings forward naturally. But this ( ver. 13 ) “I will put my trust in Him”
( 2 Sam. xxii. 3 ), what does it mean? For what follows this is also <del>introduced</del> naturally.
“Behold, I and the children which God hath given Me.” ( Isa. viii. 18.) For as here He shows
Himself a Father, so before, a Brother. “I will declare Thy name unto My brethren,” He
saith.</p>
<p>And again he indicates the superiority and the great interval <del>between us</del>, by what follows
( ver. 14 ): “Since then the children,” he saith, “are partakers of flesh and blood” (thou
seest where he saith the likeness is? in reference to the flesh), “in like manner He also Himself
took part of the same.” Let all the Heretics be ashamed, let those hide their faces who say
that He came in appearance and not in reality.2792 For he did not say, “He took part of
these” only, and then say no more; although had he said thus, it would have been sufficient,
but he asserted something more, adding “in like manner,” not in appearance, he means, or
by an image (since in that case “in like manner” is not preserved) but in reality; showing
the brotherhood.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Next he sets down also the cause of the economy.2793 “That through death,” he says,
“He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”</p>
<p>Here he points out the wonder, that by what the devil prevailed, by that was he overcome,
and the very thing which was his strong weapon against the world, <del>namely</del>, Death, by this
Christ smote him. In this he exhibits the greatness of the conqueror’s power. Dost thou see
how great good death hath wrought?</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “And should deliver them,” he says, “who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage.” Why (he means) do ye shudder? Why do you fear him that
hath been brought to nought? He is no longer terrible, but has been trodden under foot,
hath been utterly despised; he is vile and of no account. ( 2 Tim. i. 10.)</p>

Christian dispensation—here with especial reference to Christ’s death.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="721"/>
<p>But what is “through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage”? He either
means this, that he who fears death is a slave, and submits to all things rather than die; or
this, that all men were slaves of death and were held under his power, because he had not
yet been done away; or that men lived in continual fear, ever expecting that they should die,
and being afraid of death, could have no sense of pleasure, while this fear was present with
them. For this he hinted at in saying, “All their life-time.” He here shows that the afflicted,
the harassed, the persecuted, those that are deprived of country and of substance and of all
other things, spend their lives more sweetly and more freely than they of old time who were
in luxury, who suffered no such afflictions, who were in continual prosperity, if indeed these
“all their life-time” were under this fear and were slaves; while the others have been made
free and laugh at that which they shudder at. For this is now as if, when one was being led
away to a captivity leading to death, and in continual expectation of it, one should feed him
up with abundant dainties (something such as this was Death of old); but now, as if some
one taking away that fear together with the dainties, were to promise a contest, and propose
a combat that should lead no longer to death, but to a kingdom. Of which number wouldst
thou have wished to be—those who are fed up in the prison-house, while every day looking
for their sentence, or those who contend much and labor willingly, that they may crown
themselves with the diadem of the kingdom? Seest thou how he has raised up their soul,
and made them elated? He shows too, that not death alone has been put an end to, but that
thereby he also who is ever showing that war without truce against us, I mean the devil, hath
been brought to nought; since he that fears not death is out of reach of the devil’s tyranny.
For if “skin for skin, yea all things a man would give for his life” ( Job ii. 4 )—when any one
has determined to disregard even this, of what henceforward will he be the slave? He fears
no one, he is in terror of no one, he is higher than all, and more free than all. For he that
disregards his own life, much more <del>doth he disregard</del> all other things. And when the
devil finds a soul such as this, he can accomplish in it none of his works. For what? tell me,
shall he threaten the loss of property, and degradation, and banishment from one’s country?
But these are small matters to him who “counteth not even his life dear” ( Acts xx. 24 ) unto
him, according to the blessed Paul. Thou seest that in casting out the tyranny of death, he
also overthrew the strength of the devil. For he who has learnt to study innumerable [truths]
concerning the resurrection,2794 how should he fear death? How should he shudder any
more?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Therefore be ye not grieved, saying, why do we suffer such and such things? For so
the victory becomes more glorious. And it would not have been glorious, unless by death
He had destroyed death; but the most wonderful thing is that He conquered him by the very
means by which he was strong, showing in every point the abundance of His means, and
<note type="footnote">2794 μυρία φιλοσοφεῖν</note>

<pb n="722"/>
the excellence of His contrivances. Let us not then prove false to the gift bestowed on us.
“For we,” he says, “have received not a spirit of fear, but a spirit of power, and of love, and
of a sound mind.” ( Rom. viii. 15; 2 Tim. i. 7.) Let us stand then nobly, laughing death to
scorn.</p>
<p>But <del>I pause</del> for it comes over me to groan bitterly <del>at the thought of</del> whither Christ
hath raised us up, and whither we have brought ourselves down. For when I see the wailings
in the public places, the groanings over those departing life, the howlings, the other unseemly
behavior, believe me, I am ashamed before those heathen, and Jews, and heretics who see
it, and before all who for this cause openly laugh us to scorn. For whatever I may afterwards
say, I shall talk to no purpose, when philosophizing concerning the resurrection. Why? Because
the heathen do not attend to what is said by me, but to what is done by you. For they
will say at once, ‘when will any of these <del>fellows</del> be able to despise death, when he is not
able to see another dead?’</p>
<p>Beautiful things were spoken by Paul, beautiful and worthy of Heaven, and of the love
of God to man. For what does he say? “And He shall deliver them who through fear of death,
were all their life-time subject to bondage.” But ye do not allow these things to be believed,
fighting against them by your deeds. And yet many things exist for this very end, God
building a stronghold against it, that He might destroy this same evil custom. For tell me,
what mean the bright torches? Do we not send them before as athletes? And what <del>mean</del>
the hymns? Do we not glorify God, and give thanks that at last He has crowned the departed
one, that He has freed him from his labors, that taking away uncertainty, He has him with
Himself? Are not the Hymns for this? Is not Psalmody for this? All these are the acts of those
rejoicing. “For,” it is said, “is any merry? let him sing psalms.” ( Jas. v. 13.) But to these things
the heathen give no heed. For (one will say) do not tell me of him who is philosophical2795
when out of the affliction, for this is nothing great or surprising;—show me a man who in
the very affliction itself is philosophical, and then I will believe the resurrection,</p>
<p>And indeed, that women engaged in the affairs of this life2796 should act thus is no way
surprising. And yet indeed this even is dreadful; for from them also is the same philosophy
required. Wherefore also Paul says, “But concerning them which are asleep, I would not
have you ignorant, that ye sorrow not even as the rest who have no hope.” ( 1 Thess. iv. 13.)
He wrote not this to solitaries, nor to perpetual virgins, but to women and men in the
world.2797 But however this is not so dreadful. But when any man or woman, professing to
be crucified to the world, he tears his hair, and she shrieks violently—what can be more
unseemly than this? Believe me when I say if things were done as they ought, such persons
<note type="footnote">2795 The word includes the ideas of being patient, as well as of thinking and speaking deep things.</note>
<note type="footnote">2796 βιωτικὰς</note>
<note type="footnote">2797 κοσμικαῖς καὶ κοσμικοῖς</note>

<pb n="723"/>
should be excluded for a long time from the thresholds of the Church. For those who are
indeed worthy of being grieved for, are these who still fear and shudder at death, who have
no faith in the resurrection.</p>
<p>‘But I do not disbelieve the resurrection’ (one says) ‘but I long after his society.’ Why
then, tell me, when he goes from home, and that for a long absence, dost not thou do the
same? ‘Yea, but I do weep then also’ (she says) ‘and mourn as I long after him.’ But that is
the conduct of those that really long after their associates, this that of her who despairs of
his return.</p>
<p>Think, what thou singest on that occasion, “Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the
Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.” ( Ps. cxvi. 7.) And again, “I will fear no evil, for Thou
art with me.” ( Ps. xxiii. 4.) And again, “Thou art my refuge from the affliction which encompasseth
me.” ( Ps. xxxii. 7.) Think what these Psalms mean. But thou dost not give heed, but
art drunk from grief.</p>
<p>Consider carefully the funeral lamentations of others that thou mayest have a remedy
in thine own case. “Return, O my soul, to thy rest, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with
thee.” Tell me, sayest thou that the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee, and weepest? Is
not this mere acting, is it not hypocrisy? For if indeed thou really believest the things thou
sayest, thy sorrow is superfluous: but if thou art in sport and acting a part, and thinkest these
things fables, why dost thou sing psalms? Why dost thou even endure the attendants? Why
dost thou not drive away the singers? But this would be the act of madmen. And yet far
more the other.</p>
<p>For the present, then, I advise you: but as time goes on, I shall treat the matter more
seriously: for indeed I am greatly afraid that by this practice some grievous disease may
make its way into the Church. The case of the wailings then we will hereafter correct. And
meanwhile I charge and testify, both to rich and poor, both to women and men.</p>
<p>May God indeed grant that you all depart out of life unwailed, and according to the
fitting rule fathers now grown old may be attended to their graves by sons, and mothers by
daughters, and grand-children, and great grand-children, in a green old age, and that untimely
death may in no case occur. May this then be, and this I pray, and I exhort the prelates
and all of you to beseech God for each other, and to make this prayer in common. But if
(which God forbid, and may it never happen) any bitter death should occur, bitter, I mean,
not in its nature (for henceforth there is no bitter death, for it differs not at all from sleep),
but bitter in regard of your disposition, if it should happen, and any should hire these
mourning women, believe me when I say (I speak not without meaning2798 but as I have
resolved, let him who will, be angry), that person we will exclude from the Church for a
<note type="footnote">2798 ἄ λλως</note>

<pb n="724"/>
long time, as we do the idolater. For if Paul calls “the covetous man an idolater” ( Eph. v. 5
), much more him who brings in the practices of the idolaters over a believer.</p>
<p>For, tell me, for what cause dost thou invite presbyters, and the singers? Is it not to afford
consolation? Is it not to honor the departed? Why then dost thou insult him? And why dost
thou make him a public show? And why dost thou make game as on a stage? We come,
discoursing of the things concerning the resurrection, instructing all, even those who have
not yet been smitten, by the honor shown to him, to bear it nobly if any such thing should
happen and dost thou bring those who overthrow our <del>teachings</del> as much as in them lieth?
What can be worse than this ridicule and mockery? What more grievous than this inconsistency?</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Be ashamed and show reverence: but if ye will not, we cannot endure the bringing
in upon the Church of practices so destructive. For, it is said, “them that sin rebuke before
all.” ( 1 Tim. v. 20.) And as to those miserable and wretched women, we through you forbid
them2799 ever to introduce themselves into the funerals of the faithful, lest we should oblige
them in good earnest to wail over their own evils, and teach them not to do these things in
the ills of others, but rather to weep for their own misfortunes. For an affectionate father
too, when he has a disorderly son, not only advises him not to draw near to the wicked, but
puts them in fear also. Behold then, I advise you, and those women through you, that you
do not invite such persons, and that they do not attend. And may God grant that my words
may produce some effect, and that my threat may avail. But if (which God forbid) we should
be disregarded, we have no choice henceforward but to put our threat into execution,
chastising you by the laws of the Church, and those women as befits them.</p>
<p>Now if any man is obstinate and contemptuous, let him hear Christ saying even now,
“If any one trespass against thee, go, tell him his fault between thee and him alone”; but if
he will not be persuaded, “take with thee one or two.” But if even so he contradict, “tell it
to the Church, but if he shall also refuse to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen
man and a publican.” ( Matt. xviii. 15, 16, 17.) Now if when a man trespasses against me,
and will not be persuaded, <del>the Lord</del> commands me thus to turn away from him, judge ye
in what light I ought to hold him who trespasses against himself, and against God. For do
not you yourselves condemn us when we come down so gently upon you?</p>
<p>If however any man disregard the bonds which we inflict, again let Christ instruct him,
saying, “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” ( Matt. xviii. 18.) For though we ourselves
be miserable and good for nothing and worthy to be despised, as indeed we are; yet are we
not avenging ourselves nor warding off anger, but are caring for your salvation.</p>
<note type="footnote">2799 The hired wailers were heathens and not present: St. Chrys. hints at having some corporal punishment
inflicted on them.</note>

<pb n="725"/>
<p>Be influenced by reverence, I beseech you, and respect. For if a man bear with a friend
when he attacks him more vehemently than he ought, ascertaining his object, and that he
does it with kind intention, and not out of insolence; much more <del>should he bear with</del> a
teacher when rebuking him, and a teacher who does not himself say these things as of authority,
nor as one in the position of a ruler, but in that of a kindly guardian. For we do not
say these things as wishing to exhibit our authority, (for how could we, praying that we may
never come to the trial of them?) but grieving and lamenting for you.</p>
<p>Forgive me then, and let no man disregard the bonds of the Church. For it is not man
who binds, but Christ who has given unto us this authority, and makes men lords of this so
great dignity. For we indeed wish to use this power for loosing; or rather, we wish to have
no need even of that, for we wish that there should not be any bound among us—we are
not so miserable and wretched <del>as that</del> even though some of us are extreme good-fornothings.
If however we be compelled <del>so to act</del>, forgive us. For it is not of our own accord,
nor wishing it, but rather out of sorrow for you that are bound that we put the chains around
you. But if any man despise these chains, the time of judgment will come, which shall teach
him. And what comes after I do not wish to speak of, lest I should wound your minds. For
in the first place indeed we do not wish to be brought into this necessity; but if we are so
brought, we fulfill our own part, we cast around the chains. And if any man burst through
them, I have done my part, and am henceforth free from blame, and thou wilt have to give
account to Him who commanded me to bind.</p>
<p>For neither, when a king is sitting in public, if any of the guard who stand beside him
be commanded to bind one of the attendants, and to put the chains around <del>him</del>, and he
should not only thrust this man away, but also break the bonds in pieces, is it the guard who
suffers the insult, and not much more the King who gave the order. For if He claim as His
own, the things which are done to the faithful, much more will He feel as if Himself insulted
when he is insulted who has been appointed to teach.</p>
<p>But God grant that none of those who are over this Church should be driven to the necessity
of <del>inflicting</del> these bonds. For as it is a good thing not to sin, so is it profitable to
endure reproof. Let us then endure the rebuke, and earnestly endeavor not to sin; and if we
should sin let us bear the rebuke. For as it is an excellent thing not to be wounded, but, if
this should happen, to apply the remedy to the wound, so also in this case.</p>
<p>But God forbid that any man should need such remedies as these. “But we are persuaded
better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.” ( c. vi.
9.) But we have discoursed more vehemently for the sake of greater security. For it is better
that I should be suspected by you of being a harsh, and severe, and self-willed person, than
that you should do things not approved of God. But we trust in God, that this reproof will
not be unserviceable to you, but that ye will be so changed, that these discourses may be
devoted to encomiums on you and to praises: that we may all be counted worthy to attain

<p>Hebrews ii. 16–17</p>
<p>“For verily He taketh not hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold.2800
Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Paul wishing to show the great kindness of God towards man, and the Love which
He had for the human race, after saying: “Forasmuch then as the children were partakers
of blood and flesh, He also Himself likewise took part of the same” ( c. v. 14 )—follows up
the subject in this passage. For do not regard lightly what is spoken, nor think this merely
a slight <del>matter</del>, His taking on Him our flesh. He granted not this to Angels; “For verily He
taketh not hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham.” What is it that he saith? He took
not on Him an Angel’s nature, but man’s. But what is “He taketh hold of”? He did not (he
means) grasp that nature, which belongs to Angels, but ours. But why did he not say, “He
took on Him,” but used this expression, “He taketh hold of”? It is derived from the figure
of persons pursuing those who turn away from them, and doing everything to overtake
them as they flee, and to take hold of them as they are bounding away. For when human
nature was fleeing from Him, and fleeing far away (for we “were far off”— Eph. ii. 13 ), He
pursued after and overtook us. He showed that He has done this only out of kindness, and
love, and tender care. As then when he saith, “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth
to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation” ( c. i. 14 )—he shows His extreme interest
in behalf of human nature, and that God makes great account of it, so also in this place he
sets it forth much more by a comparison, for he says, “He taketh not hold of angels.” For
in very deed it is a great and a wonderful thing, and full of amazement that our flesh should
sit on high, and be adored by Angels and Archangels, by the Cherubim and the Seraphim.
For myself having oftentimes thought upon this, I am amazed at it, and imagine to myself
great things concerning the human race. For I see that the introductions are great and
splendid, and that God has great zeal on behalf of our nature.</p>
<p>Moreover he said not “of men (simply) He taketh hold,” but wishing to exalt them <del>the
Hebrews</del> and to show that their race is great and honorable, he says, “but of the seed of
Abraham He taketh hold.”</p>
<p>“Wherefore it behooved <del>Him</del> in all things to be made like unto His brethren.” What
is this, “in all things”? He was born (he means), was brought up, grew, suffered all things
necessary, at last He died. This is, “in all things to be made like unto His brethren.” For after
he had discoursed much concerning His majesty and the glory on high, he then begins
concerning the dispensation. And consider with how great power <del>he doth this</del>. How he
<note type="footnote">2800 marg. of E.V.</note>

represents Him as having great zeal “to be made like unto us”: which was a sign of much
care. For having said above, “Inasmuch then as the children were partakers of flesh and
blood, He also Himself in like manner took part of the same”; in this place also he says, “in
all things to be made like unto His brethren.” Which is all but saying, He that is so great,
He that is “the brightness of His glory,” He that is “the express image of His person,” He
that “made the worlds,” He that “sitteth on the right hand of the Father,” He was willing
and earnest to become our brother in all things, and for this cause did He leave the angels
and the other powers, and come down to us, and took hold of us, and wrought innumerable
good things. He destroyed Death, He cast out the devil from his tyranny, He freed us from
bondage: not by brotherhood alone did He honor us, but also in other ways beyond number.
For He was willing also to become our High Priest with the Father: for he adds,</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “That He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to
God.” For this cause (he means) He took on Him our flesh, only for Love to man, that He
might have mercy upon us. For neither is there any other cause of the economy, but this
alone. For He saw us, cast on the ground, perishing, tyrannized over by Death, and He had
compassion on us. “To make reconciliation,” he says, “for the sins of the people. That He
might be a merciful and faithful High Priest.”</p>
<p>What is “faithful”? True, able. For the Son is a faithful High Priest, able to deliver from
their sins those whose High Priest He is. In order then that He might offer a sacrifice able
to purify us, for this cause He has become man.</p>
<p>Accordingly he added, “in things pertaining to God,”—that is, for the sake of things in
relation to God. We were become altogether enemies to God, (he would say) condemned,
degraded, there was none who should offer sacrifice for us. He saw us in this condition, and
had compassion on us, not appointing a High Priest for us, but Himself becoming a High
Priest. In what sense He was “faithful,” he added <del>viz.</del>, “to make reconciliation for the sins
of the people.”</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “For,” he says, “in that He hath suffered Himself being tempted, He is able to
succor them that are tempted.” This is altogether low and mean, and unworthy of God. “For
in that He hath suffered Himself,” he says. It is of Him who was made flesh that he here
speaks, and it was said for the full assurance of the hearers, and on account of their weakness.
That is (he would say) He went through the very experience of the things which we have
suffered; “now” He is not ignorant of our sufferings; not only does He know them as God,
but as man also He has known them, by the trial wherewith He was tried; He suffered much,
He knows how to sympathize. And yet God is incapable of suffering: but he describes here
what belongs to the Incarnation, as if he had said, Even the very flesh of Christ suffered
many terrible things. He knows what tribulation is; He knows what temptation is, not less
than we who have suffered, for He Himself also has suffered.</p>

<pb n="729"/>
<p>(What then is this, “He is able to succor them that are tempted”? It is as if one should
say, He will stretch forth His hand with great eagerness, He will be sympathizing.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Since they wished for something great, and to have an advantage over the <del>converts</del>
from the Gentiles, he shows that they have an advantage in this while he did not hurt those
from the Gentiles at all. In what respect now is this? Because of them is the salvation, because
He took hold of them first, because from that race He assumed flesh. “For,” he says, “He
taketh not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold.” Hereby he both gives
honor to the Patriarch, and shows also what “the seed of Abraham” is. He reminds them of
the promise made to him, saying, “To thee and to thy seed will I give this land” ( Gen. xiii.
15 ); showing by the very least thing, the nearness <del>of the relationship</del> in that they were “all
of one.” But that nearness was not great: <del>so</del> he comes back to this, and thenceforward
dwells upon the dispensation which was after the flesh, and says, Even the mere willing to
become man was a proof of great care and love; but now it is not this alone, but there are
also the undying benefits which are bestowed on us through Him, for, he says, “to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people.”</p>
<p>Why said he not, of the world, instead of “the people”? for He bare away the sins of all.
Because thus far his discourse was concerning them <del>the Hebrews</del>. Since the Angel also
said to Joseph, “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people.” ( Matt. i. 21.)
For this too ought to have taken place first, and for this purpose He came, to save them and
then through them the rest, although the contrary came to pass. This also the Apostles said
at the first, “To you <del>God</del> having raised up His Son, sent <del>Him</del> to bless you” ( Acts iii. 26
): and again, “To you was the word of this Salvation sent.” ( Acts xiii. 26.) Here he shows
the noble birth of the Jews, in saying, “to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.”
For a while he speaks in this way. For that it is He who forgives the sins of all men, He declared
both in the case of the paralytic, saying, “Thy sins are forgiven” ( Mark ii. 5 ); and
also in that of Baptism: for He says to the disciples, “Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” ( Matt. xxviii. 19.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But when Paul has once taken in hand the flesh, he proceeds to utter all the lowly
things, without any fear: for see what he says next:</p>
<p>C. iii. 1, 2. “Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, who was faithful to Him that appointed
<del>or made</del> Him, as also Moses <del>was faithful</del> in all His house.”</p>
<p>Being about to place Him before Moses in comparison, he led his discourse to the law
of the high-priesthood; for they all had a high esteem for Moses: moreover, he is already
beforehand casting down the seeds of the superiority. Therefore he begins from the flesh,
and goes up to the Godhead, where there was no longer any comparison. He began from
the flesh <del>from His Human nature</del>, by assuming for a time the equality, and says, “as also
Moses in all His house”: nor does he at first show His superiority lest the hearer should start

<pb n="730"/>
away, and straightway stop his ears. For although they were believers, yet nevertheless they
still had strong feeling of conscience as to Moses. “Who was faithful,” he says, “to Him that
made Him”—made <del>Him</del> what? “Apostle and High Priest.” He is not speaking at all in this
place of His Essence, nor of His Godhead; but so far concerning human dignities.</p>
<p>“As also Moses in all His house,” that is, either among the people, or in the temple. But
here he uses the expression “in His house,” just as one might say, concerning those in the
household; even as some guardian and steward of a household, so was Moses to the people.
For that by “house” he means the people, he added, “whose house we are” ( c. iii. 6 ); that
is, we are in His creation. Then <del>comes</del> the superiority.</p>
<p>Ver. 3. “For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,” (Again <del>he is
speaking</del> of the Flesh), “inasmuch as he who hath builded2801 <del>the house</del> hath more honor
than the house”; <del>Moses</del> himself also (he means) was of the house. (Moreover he did not
say, For this one was a servant, but the Other a master, but he covertly intimated it.) If the
people were the house and he was of the people, then he certainly was of the household. For
so also we are accustomed to say, such an one is of such an one’s house. For here he is
speaking of a house, not of the temple, for the temple was not constructed by God, but by
men. But He that made2802 him <del>is</del> God. Moses he means. And see how he covertly shows
the superiority. “Faithful,” he says, “in all His house,” being himself also of the house, that
is, of the people. The builder has more honor than the house, yet he did not say “the artificer
hath more honor than his works,” but “he that hath builded the house, than the house.” (
Ver. 4.) “But He that built all things is God.” Thou seest that he is speaking not about the
temple but about the whole people.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “And Moses verily <del>was</del> faithful in all His house, as a servant, for a testimony
of those things which were to be spoken.” See also another point of superiority, that <del>which
is derived</del> from the Son and the servants. You see again that by the appellation of The Son,
he intimates true relationship. ( Ver. 6.) “But Christ as a Son over His own house.” Perceivest
thou how he separates the thing made and the maker, the servant and the son? Moreover
He indeed enters into His Father’s property as a master, but the other as a servant.</p>
<p>“Whose” <del>i.e.</del> God’s “house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of
the hope firm unto the end.” Here again he encourages them to press forward nobly, and
not to fall: for we shall be the “house” of God (he says), as Moses was, “if we hold fist our
confidence and our rejoicing firm unto the end.” He however (he would say) that is distressed
in his trials, and who falls, doth not glory: he that is ashamed, he that hideth himself, has
no confidence, he that is perplexed doth not glory.</p>
<note type="footnote">2801 κατασκεύασας</note>
<note type="footnote">2802 ποιήσας. Referring to what is implied in ver. 2 , that Moses was faithful to Him that made him.</note>

<pb n="731"/>
<p>And then he also commends them, saying, “if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing
of the hope firm unto the end,” implying that they had even made a beginning; but
that there is need of the end, and not simply to stand, but to have their hope firm “in full
assurance of faith,” without being shaken by their trials.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And be not astonished, that the <del>words</del> “Himself being tempted” ( c. ii. 18 ) are
spoken more after the manner of men. For if the Scripture says of the Father, who was not
made flesh, “The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the sons of men” ( Ps. xiv.
2 ), that is, accurately acquainted Himself with all things; and again, “I will go down, and
see whether they do altogether according to the cry of them” ( Gen. xviii. 21 ); and again,
“God cannot endure the evil ways of men” ( Gen. vi. 5 ?), the divine Scripture shows forth
the greatness of His wrath: much more, who even suffered in the flesh, these things are said
of Christ. For since many men consider experience the most reliable means of knowledge,
he wishes to show that He that has suffered knows what human nature suffers.</p>
<p>“Whence2803 holy brethren” (he says “whence” instead of “for this cause”), “partakers
of an heavenly calling”—(seek nothing here, if ye have been called yonder—yonder is the
reward, yonder the recompense. What then?) “Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus, who was faithful to Him that appointed Him, as also Moses <del>was
faithful</del> in all His house.” (What is “who was faithful to Him that appointed Him?” it is,
well disposed, protecting what belongs to Him, not allowing them to be lightly carried away,
“as also Moses in all His house”) that is, know who your High Priest is, and what He is, and
ye will need no other consolation nor encouragement. Now he calls Him “Apostle,” on account
of His having been “sent,” and “high priest of our profession,” that is of the Faith.
This One also was entrusted with a people, as the other with the leadership of a people, but
a greater one and upon higher grounds.</p>
<p>“For a testimony of those things which shall be spoken.” What meanest thou? Doth
God receive the witness of man? Yes, certainly. For if He call to witness heaven and earth
and hills (saying by the prophet, “Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath
spoken”— Isa. i. 2 —and “Hear ye ravines,2804 foundations of the earth, for the Lord hath
a controversy with His people”— Mic. vi. 2 ), much more men; that is, that they may be
witnesses, when themselves [the Jews] shameless.</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “But Christ as a Son.” The one takes care of the property of others, but this One
of His own. “And the rejoicing of the hope.” Well said he “of the hope.” For since the good
<note type="footnote">2803 ὅ θεν</note>
<note type="footnote">2804 St. Chrys. had mentioned hills (βουνοὶ) as called to witness by God: in the verse preceding this (Mic.
vi. 1) occur the words, “let the hills hear Thy voice” ; and this verse itself runs, “Hear ye hills” (βουνοὶ ) according
to the Alexandrine mss. of the LXX. or “ye mountains” (ὄ ρη according to the Vatican), “the judgment of the
Lord, and ye ravines,” U+0026c. </note>

<pb n="732"/>
things were all in hope, and yet we ought so “to hold it fast,” as even now to glory as for
things which had already come to pass: for this cause he says, “the rejoicing of the hope.”</p>
<p>And adds, “let us hold it firm unto the end.” ( Rom. viii. 24.) For “by hope we are saved”;
if therefore “we are saved by hope,” and “are waiting with patience” ( Rom. viii. 25 ), let us
not be grieved at present things, nor seek now those that have been promised afterwards;
“For” (he says) “hope which is seen is not hope.” For since the good things are great, we
cannot receive them here in this transitory life. With what object then did He even tell us
of them beforehand, when He was not about to give them here? In order that by the promise
He might refresh our souls, that by the engagement He might strengthen our zeal, that He
might anoint <del>preparing us for our contests</del> and stir up our mind. For this cause then all
these things were done.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Let us not then be troubled, let no man be troubled, when he seeth the wicked
prospering. The recompense is not here, either of wickedness or of virtue; and if in any instance
there be either of wickedness or of virtue, yet is it not according to desert, but merely
as it were a taste of the judgment, that they who believe not the resurrection may yet even
by things that happen here be brought to their senses. When then we see a wicked man rich,
let us not be cast down; when we see a good man suffering, let us not be troubled. For yonder
are the crowns, yonder the punishments.</p>
<p>Yea and in another point of view, it is not possible either that a bad man should be altogether
bad, but he may have some good things also: nor again that a good man should be
altogether good, but he may also have some sins. When therefore the wicked man prospers,
it is for evil on his own head, that having here received the reward of those few good things,
he may hereafter be utterly punished yonder; for this cause does he receive his recompense
in this life. And happy is he most of all who is punished here, that having put away all his
sins, he may depart approved, and pure, and without having to be called to account. And
this Paul teacheth us when he says, “For this cause many <del>are</del> weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep.” ( 1 Cor. xi. 30.) And again, “I have delivered such an one to Satan.” ( 1
Cor. v. 5.) And the prophet says, “for she hath received of the Lord’s hand her sins double”
( Isa. xl. 2 ); and again David, “Behold mine enemies that they are multiplied above the hairs
of my head2805 and [with] an unjust hatred have they hated me”: “and forgive Thou all my
sins.” ( Ps. xxv. 19, 18.) And again another: “O Lord, our God, give peace unto us; for Thou
hast rendered all things to us again.” ( Isa. xxvi. 12.)</p>
<p>These however are <del>the words</del> of one showing that good men receive here the punishments
of their sins. But where are the wicked [mentioned] who receive their good things
here, and there are utterly punished? Hear Abraham saying to the rich man, “Thou didst
receive good things,” and “Lazarus evil things.” ( Luke xvi. 25.) What good things? For in
<note type="footnote">2805 The words “above the hairs of my head” are part of another Psalm, xl. 12, or lxix. 4</note>

<pb n="733"/>
this place by saying “thou receivest,2806” and not thou “hadst taken,2807” he shows that it
was according to what was due to him that each was treated, and that the one was in
prosperity, and the other in adversity. And he says, “Therefore he is comforted” here (for
thou seest him pure from sins) “and thou art tormented.” Let us not then be perplexed when
we see sinners well off here; but when we ourselves are afflicted, let us rejoice. For this very
thing is paying off the penalty 2808 of sins.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us not then seek relaxation: for Christ promised tribulation to His disciples and
Paul says, “All Who will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.” ( 2 Tim. iii. 12.)
No noble-spirited wrestler, when in the lists,2809 seeks for baths, and a table full of food and
wine. This is not for a wrestler, but for a sluggard. For the wrestler contendeth with dust,
with oil, with the heat of the sun’s ray, with much sweat, with pressure and constraint. This
is the time for contest and for fighting, therefore also for being wounded, and for being
bloody and in pain. Hear what the blessed Paul says, “So fight I, not as one that beateth the
air.” ( 1 Cor. ix. 26 .) Let us consider that our whole life is in combats, and then we shall
never seek rest, we shall never feel it strange when we are afflicted: no more than a boxer
feels it strange, when he combats. There is another season for repose. By tribulation we must
be made perfect.</p>
<p>And even if there be no persecution, nor tribulation, yet there are other afflictions which
befall us every day. And if we do not bear these, we should scarcely endure those. “There
hath no temptation taken you,” it is said, “but such as is common to man.” ( 1 Cor. x. 13.)
Let us then pray indeed to God that we may not come into temptation; but if we come into
it, let us bear it nobly. For that indeed is the part of prudent men, not to throw themselves
upon dangers; but this of noble men and true philosophers. Let us not then lightly cast
ourselves upon <del>dangers</del>, for that is rashness; nor yet, if led into them, and called by circumstances
let us give in, for that is cowardice. But if indeed the Gospel2810 call us, let us not
refuse; but in a simple case, when there is no reason, nor need, nor necessity which calls us
in the fear of God, let us not rush in. For this is mere display, and useless ambition. But
should any of those things which are injurious to religion occur, then though it be necessary
to endure ten thousand deaths, let us refuse nothing. Challenge not trials, when thou findest
the things that concern godliness prosper as thou desirest. Why draw down needless dangers
which bring no gain?</p>

<p>These things I say, because I wish you to observe the laws of Christ who commands us
to “pray that we enter not into temptation” ( Matt. xxvi. 41 ), and commands us to “take up
the cross and follow” Him. ( Matt. xvi. 24.) For these things are not contradictory, nay they
are rather exceedingly in harmony. Do thou be so prepared as is a valiant soldier, be continually
in thine armor, sober, watchful, ever looking for the enemy: do not however breed
wars, for this is not <del>the act</del> of a soldier but of a mover of sedition. But if on the other hand
the trumpet of godliness call thee, go forth immediately, and make no account of thy life,
and enter with great eagerness into the contests, break the phalanx of the adversaries, bruise
the face of the devil, set up thy trophy. If however godliness be in nowise harmed, and no
one lay waste our doctrines (those I mean which relate to the soul), nor compel us to do
anything displeasing to God, do not be officious.</p>
<p>The life of the Christian must be full of blood-sheddings; I say not in shedding that of
others, but in readiness to shed one’s own. Let us then pour out our own blood, when it is
for Christ’s sake, with as great readiness as one would pour out water (for the blood which
flows about the body is water), and let us put off our flesh with as much good temper, as
one even would a garment. And this shall we do, if we be not bound to riches, if not to
houses, if not to affections, if we be detached from all things. For if they who live this life of
<del>earthly</del> soldiers bid farewell to all things, and whithersoever war calls them there present
themselves, and make journeys, and endure all things with ready mind; much more ought
we, the soldiers of Christ, so to have prepared ourselves, and to set ourselves firm against
the war of the passions.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> There is no persecution now, and God grant there may never be: but there is another
war, that of the desire of money, of envy, of the passions. Paul, describing this war, says,
“We wrestle not against flesh and blood.” ( Eph. vi. 12.) This war is ever at hand. Therefore
he wishes us to stand ever armed. Because he wishes us to stand ever armed, he says, “Stand,
having girded yourselves about.” ( Eph. vi. 14 .) Which itself also belongs to the time present,
and expresses that we ought ever to be armed. For great is the war through the tongue, great
that through the eyes; this then we must keep down—great <del>too</del> is that of the lusts.</p>
<p>Therefore he begins at that point to arm the soldier of Christ: for “stand,” saith he,
“having your loins girt about,” and he added “with truth.” ( Eph. vi. 14.) Why “with truth”?
Because lust is a mockery and a lie: wherefore the prophet says, “My loins are filled with
mockings.” ( Ps. xxxviii. 7.) The thing is not pleasure, but a shadow of pleasure. “Having
your loins,” he says, “girt about with truth”; that is, with true pleasure, with temperance,
with orderly behavior. For this cause he gives this advice, knowing the unreasonableness of
sin, and wishing that all our members should be hedged round; for “unjust anger” it is said,
“shall not be guiltless.” ( Ecclus. i. 22.)</p>
<p>Moreover he wishes us to have around us a breastplate and a buckler. For desire is a
wild beast which easily springs forth, and we shall have need of walls and fences innumerable,

<pb n="735"/>
to overcome, and to restrain it. And for this cause God has built this part <del>of our body</del> especially
with bones, as with a kind of stones, placing around it a support, so that <del>desire</del>
might not at any time, having broken or cut through, easily injure the whole man. For it is
a fire (it is said) and a great tempest, and no other part of the body could endure this violence.
And the sons of the physicians too say that for this cause the lungs have been spread under
the heart, so that the heart being itself <del>put</del> into something soft and tender, by beating as
it were into a sort of sponge, may continually be rested, and not <del>by striking</del> against the
resisting and hard sternum, receive hurt through the violence of its beatings. We have need
therefore of a strong breastplate, so as to keep this wild beast alway quiet.</p>
<p>We have need also of an helmet; for since the reasoning faculty is there, and from this
it is possible for us either to be saved, when what is right is done, or it is possible for us to
be ruined—therefore he says, “the helmet of salvation.” ( Eph. vi. 17.) For the brain is indeed
by nature tender, and therefore is covered above with the skull, as with a kind of shell. And
it is to us the cause of all things both good and evil, knowing what is fitting, or what is not
so. Yea and our feet too and our hands need armor, not these hands, nor these feet, but as
before those of the soul—the former by being employed about what is right, the latter, that
they may walk where they ought. Thus then let us thoroughly arm ourselves, and we shall
be able to overcome our enemies, and to wreathe ourselves with the crown in Christ Jesus
our Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor,
now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews iii. 7–11</p>
<p>“Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts,
as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers
tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with
that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart, and they have not known My
ways. So2811 I sware in My wrath they shall not enter into My rest.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Paul, having treated of hope, and having said that “We are His house, if we hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end” ( c. iii. ver. 6 ); next
shows that we ought to look forward with firmness, and he proves this from the Scriptures.
But be attentive, because he has expressed this in a manner somewhat difficult and not
readily to be comprehended. And therefore we must first make our own statements, and
after we have briefly explained the whole argument, then make clear the words of the Epistle.
For you will no longer need us, if you have understood the scope of the Apostle.</p>
<p>His discourse was concerning Hope, and that it behooves us to hope for the things to
come, and that for those who have toiled here there will assuredly be some reward and fruit
and refreshment. This then he shows from the prophet; and what says he? “Wherefore as
the Holy Ghost saith, To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: when your fathers tempted Me,
proved Me, and saw My works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation,
and said, they do alway err in their heart, and they have not known My ways. So2812 I sware
in My wrath, they shall not enter into My rest.”</p>
<p>He says that there are “three” rests: one, that of the Sabbath, in which God rested from
His works; the second, that of Palestine, into which when the Jews had entered they would
be at rest from their hardships and labors; the third, that which is Rest indeed, the kingdom
of Heaven; which those who obtain, do indeed rest from their labors and troubles. Of these
three then he makes mention here.</p>
<p>And why did he mention the three, when he is treating of the one only? That he might
show that the prophet is speaking concerning this one. For he did not speak (he says) concerning
the first. For how could he, when that had taken place long before? Nor yet again
concerning the second, that in Palestine. For how could he? For he says, “They shall not
enter into My rest.” It remains therefore that it is this third.</p>
<note type="footnote">2811 as.</note>
<note type="footnote">2812 as.</note>

<pb n="737"/>
<p><del>2.</del> But it is necessary also to unfold the history, to make the argument more clear. For
when they had come forth out of Egypt, and had accomplished a long journey, and had received
innumerable proofs of the power of God, both in Egypt, and in the Red Sea (cf. Acts
vii. 36 ), and in the wilderness, they determined to send spies to search out the nature of the
land; and these went and returned, admiring indeed the country, and saying that it abounded
in noble fruits, nevertheless it was a country of strong and invincible men: and the ungrateful
and senseless Jews, when they ought to have called to mind the former blessings of God,
and how when they were hemmed in the midst of the armies of so many Egyptians, He
rescued them from their perils, and made them masters of their enemies’ spoils; and again,
in the wilderness He clave the rock, and bestowed on them abundance of waters, and gave
them the manna, and the other wonderful things which He wrought; <del>when they ought, I
say, to have remembered this,</del> and to have trusted in God, they considered none of these
things, but being struck with terror, just as if nothing had been done, they said, we wish to
go back again into Egypt, “for God hath brought us out thither” (it is said) “to slay us, with
our children and wives.” (Cf. Num. xiv. 3.) God therefore being angry that they had so
quickly cast off the memory of what had been done, sware that generation, which had said
these things, should not enter into the Rest; and they all perished in the wilderness. When
David then, he says, speaking at a later period, and after these events, after that generation
of men, said, “To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts,” that ye may not
suffer the same things which your forefathers did, and be deprived of the Rest; he evidently
<del>said this</del> as of some <del>future</del> rest. For if they had received their Rest (he says) why does He
again say to them, “To-day if ye will hear His voice harden not your hearts,” as your fathers
did? What other rest then is there, except the kingdom of Heaven, of which the Sabbath was
an image and type?</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Next having set down the whole testimony (and this is, “To-day if ye will hear His
voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
when your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years. Wherefore I was
grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart, and they have not
known My ways. So I sware in My wrath, they shall not enter into My rest”), he then adds:</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
departing from the living God.” For from hardness unbelief ariseth: and as in bodies, the
parts that have become callous and hard do not yield to the hands of the physicians, so also
souls that are hardened yield not to the word of God. For it is probable besides that some
even disbelieved as though the things which had been done were not true.</p>
<p>Therefore he says, “Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
departing from the living God.” For since the argument from the future is not so persuasive
as from the past, he reminds them of the history, in which they had wanted faith. For if your
fathers (he says) because they did not hope as they ought to have hoped, suffered these

<pb n="738"/>
things, much more will you. Since to them also is this word addressed: for, “To-day” (he
says) is “ever,” so long as the world lasts.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 13. Wherefore “exhort ye one another daily, while it is called to-day.” That is,
edify one another, raise yourselves up: lest the same things should befall you. “Lest any one
of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” Seest thou that sin produces unbelief? For
as unbelief brings forth an evil life, so also a soul, “when it is come into a depth of evils, becometh
contemptuous” 2813 ( Prov. xviii. 3 ), and having become contemptuous it endures
not even to believe, in order thereby to free itself from fear. For “they said” (one says), “The
Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard.” ( Ps. xciv. 7.) And again, “Our lips
are our own: who is Lord over us?” ( Ps. xii. 4 ); and again “Wherefore hath the wicked man
provoked God to wrath?” ( Ps. x. 13 ); and again, “The fool hath said in his heart, there is
no God; they are corrupt and become abominable in their doings.” ( Ps. xiv. 1.) “There is
no fear of God before his eyes, for he was deceitful before Him, to find out2814 his iniquity
and to hate.” ( Ps. xxxvi. 1, 2.) Yea and Christ also says this same thing, “Every one that
doeth evil, hateth the light and cometh not to the light.” ( John iii. 20.)</p>
<p>Then he adds ( ver. 14 ), “For we have been made partakers of Christ.” What is this,
“We have been made partakers of Christ”? We partake of Him (he means); we were made
One, we and He—since He is the Head and we the body, “fellow-heirs and of the same body;
we are one body, of His flesh and of His bones.” ( Eph. iii. 6; Rom. xii. 5; Eph. v. 30.)</p>
<p>“If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence [or, the principle of our subsistence2815]
steadfast unto the end.” What is “the principle of our subsistence”? The faith by which we
stand, and have been brought into being and were made to exist, as one may say.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Then he adds ( ver. 15 ), “When it is said,2816 To-day if ye hear His voice, harden
not your hearts, as in the provocation.” This is a transposition,2817 “when it is said, To-day
if ye hear His voice, harden not your hearts.” <del>It must be read thus:</del></p>
<p>( Ch. iv. 1, 2.) “Let us fear lest a promise being left us of entering into His rest, any of
you should seem to come short of it; for to us was the Gospel preached2818 as well as unto
them when it is said, To-day if ye hear His voice” (for “To-day” is “at every time”2819).</p>

<p>Then <del>he adds</del> “but the word of hearing did not profit them, as they were not mixed2820
by faith with them that heard.” How did it not profit? Then wishing to alarm them, he shows
the same thing by what he says:</p>
<p>( Ch. iii. 16–19.) “For some when they had heard did provoke, howbeit not all that came
out of Egypt by Moses: And with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with them
that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear He that they
should not enter into His rest, but to them that believed not? So2821 we see, that they could
not enter in because of unbelief.” After again repeating the testimony, he adds also the
question, which makes the argument clear. For he said (he repeats), “To-day if ye hear His
voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.” Of whom does he speak (he says) <del>as</del>
having been hardened? Of whom <del>as</del> not believing? Is it not of the Jews?</p>
<p>Now what he says is to this effect. They also heard, as we hear: but no profit came to
them. Do not suppose then that by “hearing” what is proclaimed ye will be profited; seeing
that they also heard, but derived no benefit because they did not believe.</p>
<p>Caleb then and Joshua, because they agreed not with those who did not believe, escaped
the vengeance that was sent forth against them. And see how admirably he said, not, They
did not agree, but, “they were not mixed”—that is, they stood apart, but not factiously when
all the others had one and the same mind. Here it seems to me that a faction too is hinted
at.2822</p>
<p><del>6.</del> ( Ch. iv. 3.) For “we who have believed,” he says, “do enter into rest.” From what
this is evident, he adds: “as He said, as I have sworn in My wrath, if they shall enter into My
rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.” This indeed, is
not evidence that we shall enter in, but that they did not enter in. What then? Thus far he
aims to show that as that rest does not hinder the speaking of another rest, so neither does
this <del>exclude</del> that of Heaven. Up to this point then, he wishes to show that they <del>the Israelites</del>
did not attain to the rest. For because he means this, he says ( ver. 4, 5 ), “For he spake
in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from
all His works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into My rest.” Thou seest how that
doth not hinder this from being a rest?</p>
<note type="footnote">2820 συγκεκραμένους. Sav. and Ben. have συγκεκραμένης (i.e. ἀ κοῆς). The received text of the New
Testament has συγκεκραμένος, “the word not being mixed.” [This is also given in the margin of W. H. and of

<pb n="740"/>
<p>Ver. 6, 7. “Seeing therefore it remaineth” (he says) “that some must enter therein, and
they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: again he limiteth a
certain day, saying in David, To-day, after so long a time; as it has been said before.”2823
But what is it that he means? “Seeing then” (he means) that “some must” certainly “enter
in,” and “they did not enter in.” And that an entrance is proclaimed, and that “some must
enter in,” let us hear from what this is clear. Because after so many years (he says) David
again says: “To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts” ( ver. 8 ), “For if Joshua
had given them rest he would not afterward have spoken of another day.” It is evident, that
he says these things, as of persons who are to attain some recompense.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Ver. 9. “There remaineth therefore a rest2824 for the people of God.” Whence <del>does
this appear</del>? From the exhortation, “Harden not your hearts”: for if there were no rest, these
exhortations would not have been given. Neither would they have been exhorted not to do
the same things <del>with the Jews</del> lest they should suffer the same things, unless they were
about to suffer the same. But how were they who were in possession of Palestine about to
suffer the same things <del>i.e. exclusion from the rest</del> unless there were some other rest?</p>
<p>And well did he conclude the argument. For he said not rest but “Sabbath-keeping”;
calling the kingdom “Sabbath-keeping,” by the appropriate name, and that which they rejoiced
in and were attracted by. For as, on the Sabbath He commands to abstain from all
evil things; and that those things only which relate to the Service of God should be done,
which things the Priests were wont to accomplish, and whatsoever profits the soul, and
nothing else; so also <del>will it be</del> then. However it is not he who spoke thus, but what? ( Ver.
10 ), “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God
<del>did</del> from His.” As God ceased from His works, he says, so he that hath entered into His
rest <del>hath ceased</del>. For since his discourse to them was concerning rest, and they were desirous
to hear when this would be, he concluded the argument with this.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> And <del>he said</del> “To-day,”2825 that they might never be without hope. “Exhort one
another daily,” he says, <del>“while it is called today,”</del> that is, even if a man have sinned, as long
as it is “To-day,” he has hope: let no man then despair so long as he lives. Above all things
indeed, he says, “let there not be an evil heart of unbelief.” ( c. iii. 12.) But even suppose
there should be, let no man despair, but let him recover himself; for as long as we are in this
world, the “To-day” is in season. But here he means not unbelief only, but also murmurings:
“whose carcasses,” he says, “fell’ in the wilderness.”2826</p>
<note type="footnote">2823 προείρηται. This is the correct reading of the sacred text Heb. iv. 7 : for which the common editions [i.e.

<note type="footnote">2824 σαββατισμὸς</note>
<note type="footnote">2825 St. Chrys. returns here to c. iii. 13 , connecting the “To-day if ye hear His voice, harden not your heart,”
with “Exhort one another daily while it is called To-day” : as he had said, “to-day is at every time.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2826 The words of the Apostle, c. iii. 17 , are those of Num. xiv. 29 , U+0026c., where murmuring is the sin specified.</note>

<pb n="741"/>
<p>Then, lest any think that they will simply be deprived of rest only, he adds also the
punishment, saying ( c. iv. 12 ), “For the Word of God is quick, and powerful; and sharper
than any two-edged sword, and pierceth even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and
of the joints and marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” Here
he is speaking of Hell and of punishment. “It pierceth” (he says) into the secrets of our heart,
and cutteth asunder the soul. Here it is not the falling of carcasses nor, as there, the being
deprived of a country, but of a heavenly kingdom; and being delivered to an everlasting hell,
and to undying punishment and vengeance.</p>
<p>( Ch. iii. 13.) “But exhort2827 one another.” Observe the gentleness and mildness <del>of the
expression</del>: he said not “Rebuke,” but “Exhort.” Thus we are required to bear ourselves
towards those who are straightened by affliction. This he says also in writing to the Thessalonians,
“Warn them that are unruly” ( 1 Thess. v. 14 ), but in speaking of the feeble-minded,
not so, but what? “Comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men”;
that is, do not cease to hope; do not despair. For he that does not encourage one who is
straightened by affliction, makes him more hardened.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> “Lest any of you,” he says, “be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” He means either
the deceit of the devil (for it is indeed a deceit, not to look for the things to come, to think
that we are without responsibility, and that we shall not pay the penalty for our deeds here,
neither will there be a resurrection); or in another sense insensibility <del>or</del> despairing is deceit.
For to say, ‘What is there left? I have sinned once for all, I have no hope of recovering myself,’
is deceit.</p>
<p>Then he suggests hopes to them, saying ( ver. 14 ), “We are made partakers of Christ”;
All but saying, He that so loved us, He that counted us worthy of so great things, as to make
us His Body, will not suffer us to perish. Let us consider (he says) of what we have been
thought worthy: we and Christ are One: let us not then distrust Him. And again, he hints
at that which had been said in another place, that “If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.”
( 2 Tim. ii. 12.) For this is [implied in] “We are made partakers,” we partake of the same
things whereof Christ also partakes.</p>
<p>He urges them on from the good things; “for we are,” he says, “partakers of Christ.”
Then, again, from gloomy ones ( c. iv. 1 ), “Let us fear, lest at any time a promise being left
us of entering into His rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.” For that is manifest
and confessed.</p>
<p>( Ch. iii. 9.) “They proved Me,” He says, “and saw My works forty years.” Seest thou
that it is not right to call God to account, but whether He defend <del>our cause</del> or not, to trust
Him? For against those <del>of old</del> he now brings this charge, that “they tempted God.” For he
that will have proof either of His power, or of His providence, or of His tender care, does
<note type="footnote">2827 παρακαλεῖτε. The word includes the idea of comforting and encouraging as well as of exhorting.</note>

<pb n="742"/>
not yet believe, either that He is powerful or kind to man. This he hints also in writing to
these <del>Hebrews</del> who probably already wished, in their trials, to obtain experience and
positive evidence of His power and His providential care for them. Thou seest that in all
cases the provocation and the angering arises from unbelief.</p>
<p>What then does he say? ( c. iv. 9.) “There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of
God.” And see how he has summed up the whole argument. “He sware,” saith he, to those
former ones, “that they should not enter into” the “rest,” and they did not enter in. Then
long after their time discoursing to the Jews, he says, “Harden not your hearts,” as your
fathers, showing that there is another rest. For of Palestine we have not to speak: for they
were already in possession of it. Nor can he be speaking of the seventh <del>day</del>; for surely he
was not discoursing about that which had taken place long before. It follows therefore that
he hints at some other, that which is rest indeed.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> For that is indeed rest, where “pain, sorrow and sighing are fled away” ( Isa. xxxv.
10 ): where there are neither cares, nor labors, nor struggle, nor fear stunning and shaking
the soul; but only that fear of God which is full of delight. There is not, “In the sweat of thy
face thou shalt eat thy bread,” nor “thorns and thistles” ( Gen. iii. 19, 18 ); no longer, “In
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and to thy husband shall be thy desire and he shall
rule over thee.” ( Gen. iii. 16.) All is peace, joy, gladness, pleasure, goodness, gentleness.
There is no jealousy, nor envy, no sickness, no death whether of the body, or that of the
soul. There is no darkness nor night; all <del>is</del> day, all light, all things are bright. It is not possible
to be weary, it is not possible to be satiated: we shall always persevere in the desire of good
things.2828</p>
<p>Would you that I should also give you some image of the condition there? It is impossible.
But yet, so far as it is possible, I will try to give you some image. Let us look up into the
heaven when without any intervening cloud it shows forth its crown <del>of stars</del>. Then when
we have dwelt long on the beauty of its appearance, let us think that we too shall have a
pavement, not indeed such <del>as this</del>, but as much more beautiful as the gold is than the clay,
and <del>let us think</del> on the higher roof which is again beyond; then on the Angels, the
Archangels, the infinite multitude of unbodied powers, the very palace of God itself, the
Throne of the Father.</p>
<p>But language is too weak (as I said) to set forth the whole. Experience is necessary, and
the knowledge which <del>cometh</del> by experience. Tell me, how was it (think you) with Adam
in Paradise? This course of life is far better than that, as much as heaven <del>is better</del> than
earth.</p>
<note type="footnote">2828 [The insatiate yet satisfied; The full yet craving still. Rhythm of Bernard de Morlaix , translated by Dr.
Neale, p. 15.]</note>

<pb n="743"/>
<p><del>11.</del> But however let us search after another image still. If it happened that he who now
reigns was master of the whole world, and then was troubled neither by wars nor by cares,
but was honored only and lived delicately; and had large tributes, and on every side gold
flowed in to him, and he was looked up to, what feelings do you think he would have, if he
saw that all the wars in all parts of the world had ceased? Something such as this will it be.
But rather I have not even yet arrived at that image <del>which I seek</del>; therefore I must search
after another too.</p>
<p>Consider then, I pray you: for as some royal child, so long as he is in the womb, has no
sense of anything, but should it happen that he suddenly came forth from thence, and ascended
the royal throne, not gradually, but all at once received possession of all things; so is it
as regards this <del>present</del> and that <del>future</del> state. Or, if some captive, having suffered innumerable
evils, should be caught up at once to the royal throne.</p>
<p>But not even thus have I attained to the image exactly. For here indeed whatever good
things a person may obtain, even shouldst thou say the kingdom itself, during the first day
indeed his desires are in full vigor, and for the second too, and the third, but as time goes
on, he continues indeed to have pleasure, but not so great. For whatever it be, it always
ceases from familiarity with it. But yonder it not only does not diminish, but even increases.
For consider how great a thing it is, that a soul after departing thither, should no longer
look for an end of those good things, nor yet change, but increase, and life that has no end,
and life set free from all danger, and from all despondency and care, full of cheerfulness and
blessings innumerable.</p>
<p>For if when we go out into a plain, and there see the soldiers’ tents fixed with curtains,
and the spears, and helmets, and bosses of the bucklers glittering, we are lifted up with
wonder; but if we also chance to see the king himself running in the midst or even riding
with golden armor, we think we have everything; what thinkest thou <del>it will be</del> when thou
seest the everlasting tabernacles of the saints pitched in heaven? (For it is said, “They shall
receive you into their everlasting tabernacles”— Luke xvi. 9 ) when thou seest each one of
them beaming with light above the rays of the sun, not from brass and steel, but from that
glory whose gleamings the eye of man cannot look upon? And this indeed with respect to
the men. But what, if one were to speak of the thousands of Angels, of Archangels, of
Cherubim, of Seraphim, of thrones, of dominions, of principalities, of powers, whose beauty
is inimitable, passing all understanding?</p>
<p>But how far shall I go in pursuing what cannot be overtaken? “For eye hath not seen,”
it is said, “nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
hath prepared for them that love Him.” ( 1 Cor. ii. 9.) Therefore nothing is more pitiable
than those who miss, nor anything more blessed than those who attain. Let us then be of
the blessed, that we may attain to the everlasting good things that are in Christ Jesus our

Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now

<p>Hebrews iv. 11–13</p>
<p>“Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
For the word of God is quick <del>i.e. living</del> and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged
sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints
and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there
any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things are naked and opened unto
the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Faith is indeed great and bringeth salvation, and without it, it is not possible ever
to be saved. It suffices not however of itself to accomplish this, but there is need of a right
conversation also. So that on this account Paul also exhorts those who had already been
counted worthy of the mysteries; saying, “Let us labor to enter into that rest.” “Let us labor”
(he says), Faith not sufficing, the life also ought to be added thereto, and our earnestness to
be great; for truly there is need of much earnestness too, in order to go up into Heaven. For
if they who suffered so great distress in the Wilderness, were not counted worthy of <del>the
promised</del> land, and were not able to attain <del>that</del> land, because they murmured and because
they committed fornication: how shall we be counted worthy of Heaven, if we live carelessly
and indolently? We then have need of much earnestness.</p>
<p>And observe, the punishment does not extend to this only, the not entering in (for he
said not, “Let us labor to enter into the rest,” lest we fail of so great blessings), but he added
what most of all arouses men. What then is this? “Lest any man fall, after the same example
of unbelief.” What means this? It means that we should have our mind, our hope, our expectation,
yonder, lest we should fail. For that <del>otherwise</del> we shall fail, the example shows,
“lest <del>U+0026c. </del> after the same,” he says.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> In the next place, lest hearing [the words] “after the same <del>example</del>,” thou
shouldest think that the punishment is the same, hear what he adds; “For the Word of God
is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierceth even to the dividing
asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart.” In these words he shows that He, the Word of God,
wrought the former things also, and lives, and has not been quenched.2829</p>
<p>Do not then when hearing the Word, think of it lightly. For “He is sharper,” he says,
“than a sword.” Observe His condescension; and hence consider why the prophets also
<note type="footnote">2829 [St. Chrys. here understands the λόγος of the Second Person of the Trinity. It is now generally interpreted
as a personification of the spoken or written word sent forth by Him.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="746"/>
needed to speak of saber2830 and bow and sword.2831 “If ye turn not,” it is said, “He will
whet His sword, He hath bent His bow and made it ready.” ( Ps. vii. 12.) For if now, after
so long a time, and after their being perfected,2832 He cannot smite down by the name of
the Word alone, but needs these expressions in order to show the superiority [arising] from
the comparison <del>of the Gospel with the law</del>: much more then <del>of old</del>.</p>
<p>“Piercing,” he says, “even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit.” What is this? He
hinted at something more fearful. Either that He divides the spirit from the soul, or that He
pierces even through them disembodied, not as a sword through bodies only. Here he shows,
that the soul also is punished, and that it thoroughly searches out the most inward things,
piercing wholly through the whole man.</p>
<p>“And is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any creature
that is not manifest in His sight.” In these words most of all he terrified them. For do not
(he says) be confident if ye still stand fast in the Faith, but without full assurance. He judges
the inner heart, for there He passes through, both punishing and searching out.</p>
<p>And why speak I of men? he says. For even if thou speak of Angels, of Archangels, of
the Cherubim, of the Seraphim, even of any “creature” whatsoever: all things are laid open
to that Eye, all things are clear and manifest; there is nothing able to escape it; “All things
are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him, with whom we have to do.”</p>
<p>But what is “opened”2833 ? <del>It is</del> a metaphor from the skins which are drawn off from
the victims. For as in that case, when a man has killed them, and has drawn aside the skin
from the flesh, he lays open all the inward parts, and makes them manifest to our eyes; so
also do all things lie open before God. And observe, I pray thee, how he constantly needs
bodily im ages; which arose from the weakness of the hearers. For that they were weak, he
made plain, when he said that they were “dull,” and “had need of milk, not of strong meat.”
“All things are naked,” he says, “and opened unto the eyes of Him, with whom we have to
do.” ( c. v. 11, 12.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But what is, “after the same example of unbelief”? As if one should say, why did
they of old not see the land? They had received an earnest of the power of God; they ought
to have believed, but yielding too much to fear and imagining nothing great concerning
God, and being faint-hearted,—so they perished. And there is also something more to be
said, as, that after they had accomplished the most part of the journey, when they were at

<pb n="747"/>
the very doors, at the haven itself, they were sunk into the sea. This I fear (he says) for you
also. This is <del>the meaning of</del> “after the same example of unbelief.”</p>
<p>For that these also <del>to whom he is writing</del> had suffered much, he afterwards testifies,
saying, “Call to mind the former days, in which after that ye had been enlightened, ye endured
a great fight of afflictions.” ( c. x. 32.) Let no man then be faint-hearted, nor fall down near
the end through weariness. For there are, there are those who at the beginning engage in
the fight with the full vigor of zeal; but a little after, not being willing to add to all, they lose
all. Your forefathers (he says) are sufficient to instruct you not to fall into the same <del>sins</del>,
not to suffer the same things which they suffered. This is, “After the same example of unbelief.”
Let us not faint, he means (which he says also near the end <del>of the Epistle</del>. “Lift up
the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees”): “lest any man,” he says, “fall after the
same example.” ( c. xii. 12.) For this is to fall indeed.</p>
<p>Then, lest when thou hearest, “any man fall after the same example,” thou shouldest
conceive of the same death which they also underwent, see what he says: “For the Word of
God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword.” For the Word falls upon
the souls of these <del>men</del> more severely than any sword, causing grievous wounds; and inflicts
fatal blows. And of these things he need not give the proof, nor establish them by argument,
having a history so fearful. For (he would say) what kind of war destroyed them? What sort
of sword? Did they not fall simply of themselves? For let us not be careless because we have
not suffered the same things. While “it is called To-day,” it is in our power to recover
ourselves.</p>
<p>For lest on hearing the things that belong to the soul we should grow negligent, he adds
also what concerns the body. For then it is as a king, when his officers are guilty of some
great fault, first strips them (say) of their command, and after depriving them of their belt,
and their rank, and their herald,2834 then punishes them: so also in this case the sword of
the Spirit works.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Next he discourses of the Son, “with whom we have to do,” he says. What is “with
whom we have to do”? To Him (he would say) we have to render account for the things we
have done? Even so. How then <del>must we act</del> that we fall not, nor be faint-hearted?</p>
<p>These things indeed (he would say) are sufficient to instruct us. But we have also “a
great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.” Because he added
<del>it</del>, for this reason he went on, “For we have not an High Priest who cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities.” Therefore he said above, “In that He hath suffered
Himself being tempted, He is able to succor them which are tempted.” See then how here
also he does the same. And what he says is to this effect: He went (he says) the road which
<note type="footnote">2834 Having a κήρυξ was a special mark of dignity, belonging to certain offices. See Mr. Field’s notes.</note>

<pb n="748"/>
we also <del>are going</del> now, or rather even a more rugged one. For He had experience of all
human <del>sufferings</del>.</p>
<p>He had said above “There is no creature that is not manifest in His sight,” intimating
His Godhead; then, since he had touched on the flesh, he again discourses more condescendingly,
saying ( ver. 14 ), “Having then a great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens”:
and shows that His care is greater and that He protects them as His own, and would not
have them fall away. For Moses indeed (he says) did not enter into the rest, while He <del>Christ</del>
did enter in. And it is wonderful how he has nowhere stated the same, lest they might seem
to find an excuse; he however implied it, but that he might not appear to bring an accusation
against the man,2835 he did not say it openly. For if, when none of these things had been
said, they yet brought forward these <del>charges</del>, saying, This man hath spoken against Moses
and against the law (see Acts xxi. 21, 28 ); much more, if he had said, It is not Palestine but
Heaven,2836 would they have said stronger things than these.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But he attributes not all to the Priest, but requires also what is <del>to come</del> from us, I
mean our profession. For “having,” he says, “a great High Priest, who is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession” <del>or “confession”2837</del>. What
sort of profession does he mean? That there is a Resurrection, that there is a retribution:
that there are good things innumerable; that Christ is God, that the Faith is right. These
things let us profess, these things let us hold fast. For that they are true, is manifest from the
fact, that the High Priest is within. We have not failed of <del>our hopes</del>, let us confess; although
the realities are not present, yet let us confess: if already they were present they were but a
lie. So that this also is true, that <del>our good things</del> are deferred. For our High Priest also is
Great.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “For we have not an High Priest, who cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities.” He is not (he means) ignorant of what concerns us, as many of the High
Priests, who know not those in tribulations, nor that there is tribulation at any time. For in
the case of men it is impossible that one should know the affliction of the afflicted who has
not had experience, and gone through the actual sensations. Our High Priest endured all
things. Therefore He endured first and then ascended, that He might be able to sympathize
with us.</p>
<p>But was “in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” Observe how both above
he has used the word “in like manner,”2838 and here “after the likeness.” ( c. ii. 14.) That is,
<note type="footnote">2835 i.e. Moses.</note>
<note type="footnote">2836 There are two points of superiority over Moses implied in the words “that is passed into the Heavens.”
1. That Christ entered into the rest which He promised His people, while Moses did not. 2. That that rest is
Heaven, not the earthly Canaan.</note>

He was persecuted, was spit upon, was accused, was mocked at, was falsely informed against,
was driven out, at last was crucified.</p>
<p>“After our likeness, without sin.” In these words another thing also is suggested, that it
is possible even for one in afflictions to go through them without sin. So that when he says
also “in the likeness of flesh” ( Rom. viii. 3 ), he means not that He took on Him <del>merely</del>
“the likeness of flesh,” but “flesh.” Why then did he say “in the likeness”? Because he was
speaking about “sinful flesh”: 2839 for it was “like” our flesh, since in nature it was the same
with us, but in sin no longer the same.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Ver. 16. “Let us come then boldly <del>with confidence</del> unto the throne of His grace,
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”</p>
<p>What “throne of grace” is he speaking of? that royal throne concerning which it is said,
“The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand.” ( Ps. cx. 1.)</p>
<p>What is “let us come boldly”? Because “we have a sinless High Priest” contending with
the world. For, saith He, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” ( John xvi. 33 ); for,
this is to suffer all things, and yet to be pure from sins. Although we (he means) are under
sin, yet He is sinless.</p>
<p>How is it that we should “approach boldly”? Because now it is a throne of Grace, not a
throne of Judgment. Therefore boldly, “that we may obtain mercy,” even such as we are
seeking. For the affair is <del>one of</del> munificence, a royal largess.</p>
<p>“And may find grace to help in time of need <del>for help in due season</del>.” He well said, “for
help in time of need.” If thou approach now (he means) thou wilt receive both grace and
mercy, for thou approachest “in due season”; but if thou approach then,2840 no longer <del>wilt
thou receive it</del>. For then the approach is unseasonable, for it is not “then a throne of Grace.”
Till that time He sitteth granting pardon, but when the end <del>is come</del>, then He riseth up to
judgment. For it is said, “Arise, O God, judge the earth.” ( Ps. lxxxii. 8.) (“Let us come boldly,”
or he says again having no “evil conscience,” that is, not being in doubt, for such an one
cannot “come with boldness.”) On this account it is said, “I have heard thee in an accepted
time and in a day of salvation have I succored thee.” ( 2 Cor. vi. 2.) Since even now for those
to find repentance who sin after baptism is of grace.</p>
<p>But lest when thou hearest of an High Priest, thou shouldst think that He standeth, he
forthwith leads to the throne.2841 But a Priest doth not sit, but stands. Seest thou that <del>for</del>

<del>Him</del> to be made High Priest, is not of nature,2842 but of grace and condescension, and
humiliation?</p>
<p>This is it seasonable for us also now to say, “Let us draw near” asking “boldly”: let us
only bring Faith and He gives all things. Now is the time of the gift; let no man despair of
himself. Then <del>will be</del> the time of despairing, when the bride-chamber is shut, when the
King is come in to see the guests, when they who shall be accounted worthy thereof, shall
have received as their portion the Patriarch’s bosom: but now it is not as yet so. For still are
the spectators assembled, still is the contest, still is the prize in suspense.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us then be earnest. For even Paul saith, “I so run not as uncertainly.” ( 1 Cor.
ix. 26.) There is need of running, and of running vehemently. He that runneth <del>a race</del> seeth
none of those that meet him; whether he be passing through meadows, or through dry
places: he that runneth looketh not at the specta tors, but at the prize. Whether they be rich
or whether they be poor, whether one mock at him, or praise him, whether one insult, or
cast stones at him, or plunder his house, whether he see children, or wife, or anything
whatever. He is occupied in one thing alone, in running, in gaining the prize. He that runneth,
never standeth still, since even if he slacken a little, he has lost the whole. He that runneth,
not only slackens nothing before the end, but then even especially straineth his speed.</p>
<p>This have I spoken for those who say; In our younger days we used discipline,2843 in
our younger days we fasted, now we are grown old. Now most of all it behooves you to make
your carefulness more intense. Do not count up to me the old things especially done well:
be now youthful and vigorous. For he that runneth this bodily race, when gray hairs have
overtaken him, probably is not able to run as he did before: for the whole contest depends
on the body; but thou—wherefore dost thou lessen thy speed? For in this race there is need
of a soul, a soul thoroughly awakened: and the soul is rather strengthened in old age; then
it is in its full vigor, then is it in its pride.</p>
<p>For as the body, so long as it is oppressed by fevers and by one sickness after another,
even if it be strong, is exhausted, but when it is freed from this attack, it recovers its proper
force, so also the soul in youth is feverish, and is chiefly possessed by the love of glory, and
luxurious living, and sensual lusts, and many other imaginations; but old age, when it comes
on, drives away all these passions, some through satiety, some through philosophy. For old
age relaxes the powers of the body, and does not permit the soul to make use of them even
if it wish, but repressing them as enemies of various kinds, it sets her in a place free from
troubles and produces a great calm, and brings in a greater fear.</p>

<p>For if none else does, it is said, yet they who are grown old know, that they are drawing
to their end, and that they certainly stand near to death. When therefore the desires of this
life are withdrawing, and the expectation of the judgment-seat is coming on, softening the
stubbornness of the soul, does it not become more attentive, if one be willing?</p>
<p><del>8.</del> What then (you allege) when we see old men more intractable than young ones?
Thou tellest me of an excess of wickedness. For in the case of madmen too, we see them
going over precipices, when no man pushes them. When therefore, an old man has the
diseases of the young, this is an excess of wickedness; besides not even in youth would such
an one have an excuse: since he is not able to say, “Remember not the sins of my youth, and
my ignorances.” ( Ps. xxv. 7.) For he who in old age remains the same, shows that even in
youth, he was what he was not from ignorance, nor from inexperience, nor from the time
of life, but from slothfulness. For that man may say, “Remember not the sins of my youth,
and mine ignorances,” who does such things as become an old man, who changes in old
age. But if even in age he continue the same unseemly courses, how can such an one be
worthy of the name of an old man, who has no reverence even for the time of life? For he
who says, “Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my ignorances,” utters this, as one doing
right in his old age. Do not then, by the deeds of age, deprive thyself also of pardon for the
sins of youth.</p>
<p>For how can what is done be otherwise than unreasonable, and beyond pardon? An old
man sits in taverns. An old man hurries to horse-races—an old man goes up into theaters,
running with the crowd like children. Truly it is a shame and a mockery, to be adorned
outside with gray hairs, but within to have the mind of a child.</p>
<p>And indeed if a young man insult <del>him</del>, he immediately puts forward his gray hairs.
Reverence them first thyself; if however thou dost not reverence thy own even when old,
how canst thou demand of the young to reverence them? Thou dost not reverence the gray
hairs, but puttest them to shame. God hath honored thee with whiteness of hairs: He hath
given thee high dignity. Why dost thou betray the honor? How shall the young man reverence
thee, when thou art more wanton than he? For the hoary head is then venerable, when it
acts worthily of the gray head; but when it plays youth, it will be more ridiculous than the
young. How then will you old men be able to give these exhortations to the young man
when you are intoxicated by your disorderliness?</p>
<p><del>9.</del> I say not these things as accusing the old, but the young. For in my judgment they
who act thus even if they have come to their hundredth year, are young; just as the young
if they be but little children, yet if they are sober-minded, are better than the old. And this
doctrine is not my own, but Scripture2844 also recognizes the same distinction. “For,” it
<note type="footnote">2844 [ἡ γραφή, the same form of quotation as in the case of the canonical Scriptures.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="752"/>
says, “honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, and an unspotted life is
old age.” ( Wisd. iv. 8, 9.)</p>
<p>For we honor the gray hair, not because we esteem the white color above the black, but
because it is a proof of a virtuous life; and when we see them we conjecture therefrom the
inward hoariness. But if men continue to do what is inconsistent with the hoary head, they
will on that account become the more ridiculous. Since we also honor the Emperor, and the
purple and the diadem, because they are symbols of his office. But if we should see him,
with the purple, spitted on, trodden under foot by the guards, seized by the throat, cast into
prison, torn to pieces, shall we then reverence the purple or the diadem, and not rather weep
over the pomp itself? Claim not then to be honored for thy hoary head, when thou thyself
wrongest it. For it ought indeed itself to receive satisfaction from thee, because thou bringest
disgrace on a form so noble and so honorable.</p>
<p>We say not these things against all <del>old persons</del>, nor is our discourse against old age
simply (I am not so mad as that), but against a youthful spirit bringing dishonor on old age.
Nor is it concerning those who are grown old that we sorrowfully say these things, but
concerning those who disgrace the hoary head.</p>
<p>For the old man is a king, if you will, and more royal than he who wears the purple, if
he master his passions, and keep them under subjection, in the rank of guards. But if he be
dragged about and thrust down from his throne, and become a slave of the love of money,
and vainglory, and personal adornment, and luxuriousness, and drunkenness, anger, and
sensual pleasures, and has his hair dressed out with oil, and shows an age insulted by his
way of life, of what punishment would not such an one be worthy?</p>
<p><del>10.</del> But may ye not be such, O young men! for not even for you is there the excuse for
sinning. Why so? Because it is possible to be old in youth: just as there are youths in old age,
so also the reverse. For as in the one case the white hair saves no one, so in the other the
black is no impediment. For if it is disgraceful for the old man to do these things of which
I have spoken, much more than for the young man, yet still the young man is not freed from
accusation. For a young man can have an excuse only, in case he is called to the management
of affairs, when he is still inexperienced, when he needs time and practice; but no longer
when it is necessary to display temperance and courage, nor yet when it is needful to keep
his property.</p>
<p>For it sometimes happens that the young man is blamed more than the old. For the one
needs much service, old age making him feeble: but the other being able, if he will, to provide
for himself, what sort of excuse should he meet with, when he plunders more than the old,
when he remembers injuries, when he is contemptuous, when he does not stand forward
to protect others more than the old man, when he utters many things unseasonably, when
he is insolent, when he reviles, when he is drunken?</p>

<pb n="753"/>
<p>And if in the <del>matter of</del> chastity he think that he cannot be impleaded,2845 consider
that here also he has many helps, if he will. For although desire trouble him more violently
than it doth the old, yet nevertheless there are many things which he can do more than an
old man, and so charm that wild beast. What are these things? Labors, readings, watchings
through the night, fastings.</p>
<p><del>11.</del> What then are these things to us (one says) who are not monastics? Sayest thou
this to me? Say it to Paul, when he says, “Watching with all perseverance and supplication”
( Eph. vi. 18 ), when he says, “Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.”
( Rom. xiii. 14.) For surely he wrote not these things to solitaries only, but to all that are in
cities. For ought the man who lives in the world to have any advantage over the solitary,
save only the living with a wife? In this point he has allowance, but in others none, but it is
his duty to do all things equally with the solitary.</p>
<p>Moreover the Beatitudes <del>pronounced</del> by Christ, were not addressed to solitaries only:
since in that case the whole world would have perished, and we should be accusing God of
cruelty. And if these beatitudes were spoken to solitaries only, and the secular person cannot
fulfill them, yet He permitted marriage, then He has destroyed all men. For if it be not possible,
with marriage, to perform the duties of solitaries, all things have perished and are
destroyed, and the <del>functions</del> of virtue are shut up in a strait.</p>
<p>And, how can marriage be honorable, which so hinders us? What then? It is possible,
yea very possible, even if we have wives, to pursue after virtue, if we will. How? If having
“wives,” we “be as though we had none,” if we rejoice not over our “possessions,” if we “use
the world as not abusing it.” ( 1 Cor. vii. 29, 31.)</p>
<p>And if any persons have been hindered by marriage state, let them know that marriage
is not the hindrance, but their purpose which made an ill use of marriage. Since it is not
wine which makes drunkenness, but the evil purpose, and the using it beyond due measure.
Use marriage with moderation, and thou shalt be first in the kingdom, and shalt enjoy all
good things, which may we all attain by the grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily VIII.</head>
<p>Hebrews v. 1–3</p>
<p>“For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to
God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on2846
the ignorant and on them that are out of the way, for that he himself also is compassed
with infirmity; and by reason hereof he ought, as for the people so also for himself to offer
for sins.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The blessed Paul wishes to show in the next place that this covenant is far better
than the old. This then he does by first laying down remote considerations. For inasmuch
as there was nothing bodily or that made a show,2847 no temple for instance, nor Holy of
Holies, nor Priest with so great apparel, no legal observances, but all things higher and more
perfect, and there was nothing of bodily things, but all was in things spiritual, and things
spiritual did not attract the weak, as things bodily; he thoroughly sifts this whole matter.</p>
<p>And observe his wisdom: he makes his beginning from the priest first, and continually
calls Him an High Priest, and from this first <del>point</del> shows the difference <del>of the two Dispensations</del>.
On this account he first of all defines what a Priest is, and shows whether He
has any things proper to a Priest, and whether there are any signs of priesthood. It was
however an objection in his way that He <del>Christ</del> was not even well-born, nor was He of the
sacerdotal tribe, nor a priest on earth. How then was He a Priest? some one may say.</p>
<p>And just as in the Epistle to the Romans having taken up an argument of which they
were not easily persuaded, that Faith effects that which the labor of the Law could not, nor
the sweat of the daily life, he betook himself to the Patriarch and referred the whole <del>question</del>
to that time: so now here also he opens out the other path of the Priesthood, showing its
superiority from the things which happened before. And as, in <del>the matter of</del> punishment,
he brings before them not Hell alone, but also what happened to their fathers,2848 so now
here also, he first establishes this position from things present. For it were right indeed that
earthly things should be proved from heavenly, but when the hearers are weak, the opposite
course is taken.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Up to a certain point he lays down first the things which are common <del>to Christ
and their High Priests</del>, and then shows that He is superior. For comparative2849 excellence
<note type="footnote">2846 μετριοπαθεῖν</note>

<note type="footnote">2849 ἡ κατὰ σύγκρισιν</note>

<pb n="755"/>
arises thus, when in some respects there is community, in others superiority; otherwise it
is no longer comparative.</p>
<p>“For every High Priest taken from among men,” this is common to Christ; “is ordained
for men in things pertaining to God,” and this also; “that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for the people,” and this too, <del>yet</del> not entirely: what follows however is no longer so: “who
can have compassion2850 on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way,” from this
point forward is the superiority, “inasmuch as himself also is encompassed with infirmity;
and by reason hereof he ought as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.”</p>
<p>Then also <del>there are</del> other <del>points</del>: He is made <del>Priest</del> (he says) by Another and does
not of Himself intrude into <del>the office</del>. This too is common ( ver. 4 ), “And no man taketh
this honor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.”</p>
<p>Here again he conciliates2851 them in another point, because He was sent from God:
which Christ was wont to say throughout to the Jews. “He that sent Me is greater than I,”
and, “I came not of Myself.” ( John xii. 49; xiv. 28; viii. 42.)</p>
<p>He appears to me in these words also to hint at the priests of the Jews, as being no longer
priests, <del>but</del> intruders and corrupters of the law of the priesthood; ( ver. 5 ) “So Christ also
glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest.”</p>
<p>How then was He appointed (one says)? For Aaron was many times appointed as by
the Rod, and when the fire came down and destroyed those who wished to intrude into the
priesthood. But in this instance, on the contrary, they <del>the Jewish Priests</del> not only suffered
nothing, but even are in high esteem. Whence then <del>His appointment</del>? He shows it from
the prophecy. He has nothing <del>to allege</del> perceptible by sense, nothing visible. For this cause
he affirms it from prophecy, from things future; “But He that said unto Him Thou art My
Son, to-day have I begotten Thee.” What has this to do with the Son? Yea (he says) it is a
preparation for His being appointed by God.</p>
<p>Ver. 6. “As He saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest forever after the order of
Melchisedech.” Unto whom now was this spoken?</p>
<p>Who is “after the order of Melchisedech”? No other <del>than He</del>. For they all were under
the Law, they all kept sabbaths, they all were circumcised; one could not point out any other
<del>than Him</del>.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Ver. 7, 8. “Who in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications
with strong crying and tears, to Him that was able to save Him from death, and
was heard in that He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things
which He suffered.” Seest thou that he sets forth nothing else than His care and the exceeding
<note type="footnote">2850 [St. Chrys. has not drawn attention to the nice distinction between μετριοπαθεῖν equal “to bear reasonably
with,” applied to the earthly High Priest, and συμπαθεῖν equal “to sympathize with,” applied to Christ.—F.G.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2851 θεραπεύει</note>

<pb n="756"/>
greatness of His love? For what means the <del>expression</del> “with strong crying”? The Gospel
nowhere says this, nor that He wept when He prayed, nor yet that He uttered a cry. Seest
thou that it was a condescension? For he could not <del>merely</del> say that He prayed, but also
“with strong crying.”</p>
<p>“And was heard,” (he says), “in that He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He
obedience by the things which He suffered.” ( Ver. 9, 10 ), “And being made perfect He became
the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him: called of God an High
Priest after the order of Melchisedech.”</p>
<p>Be it with “crying,” why also “strong <del>crying</del> and tears”?</p>
<p>“Having offered,” (he says), “and having been heard in that He feared.” What sayest
thou? Let the Heretics2852 be ashamed. The Son of God “was heard in that He feared.” And
what more could any man say concerning the prophets? And what sort of connection is
there, in saying, “He was heard in that He feared, though He were Son, yet learned He
obedience by the things which He suffered”? Would any man say these things concerning
God? Why, who was ever so mad? And who, even if he were beside himself, would have
uttered these things? “Having been heard,” (he says), “in that He feared, He learned obedience
by the things which He suffered.” What obedience? He that before this had been obedient
even unto death, as a Son to His Father, how did He afterwards learn? Seest thou that this
is spoken concerning the Incarnation?</p>
<p>Tell me now, did He pray the Father that He might be saved from death? And was it
for this cause that He was “exceeding sorrowful, and said, If it be possible, let this cup pass
from Me”? ( Matt. xxvi. 38, 39.) Yet He nowhere prayed the Father concerning His resurrection,
but on the contrary He openly declares, “Destroy this temple and within three days I
will raise it up.” ( John. ii. 19.) And, “I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to
take it again. No man taketh it from Me, I lay it down of Myself.” ( John x. 18.) What then
is it; why did He pray? (And again He said, “Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of
Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to
death. And they shall deliver Him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify
Him; and the third day He shall rise again” ( Matt. xx. 18, 19 ), and said not, “My Father
shall raise Me up again.”) How then did He pray concerning this? But for whom did He
pray? For those who believed on Him.</p>
<p>And what he means is this, ‘He is readily listened to.’ For since they had not yet the right
opinion concerning Him, he said that He was heard. Just as He Himself also when consoling
His disciples said, “If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice, because I go to My Father” ( John xiv.
28 ), and “My Father is greater than I.” But how did He not glorify Himself, He who “made
Himself of no reputation” ( Philip. ii. 7 ), He who gave Himself up? For, it is said, “He gave
<note type="footnote">2852 Heretics who denied the reality of our Lord’s human nature.</note>

<pb n="757"/>
Himself” up “for our sins.” (See Gal. i. 4.) And again, “Who gave Himself a ransom for us
all.” ( 1 Tim. ii. 6.) What is it then? Thou seest that it is in reference to the flesh that lowly
things are spoken concerning Himself: So also here, “Although He were Son, He was heard
in that He feared,” it is said. He wishes to show, that the success was of Himself, rather than
of God’s favor. So great (he says) was His reverence, that even on account thereof God had
respect unto Him.</p>
<p>“He learned,” he saith, to obey God. Here again he shows how great is the gain of sufferings.
“And having been made perfect,” he says, “He became the Author of salvation to them
that obey Him.” (Cf. supra, pp. 384, 391.) But if He, being the Son, gained obedience from
His sufferings, much more shall we. Dost thou see how many things he discourses about
obedience, that they might be persuaded to it? For it seems to me that they would not be
restrained. “From the things,” he says, “which He suffered He” continually “learned” to
obey God. And being “made perfect” through sufferings. This then is perfection, and by
this means must we arrive at perfection. For not only was He Himself saved, but became to
others also an abundant supply of salvation. For “being made perfect He became the Author
of salvation to them that obey Him.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> “Being called,” he says, “of God an High Priest after the order of Melchisedech”: (
ver. 11 ) “Of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered <del>or explained</del>.”
When he was about to proceed to the difference of the Priesthood, he first reproves them,
pointing out both that such great condescension was “milk,” and that it was because they
were children that he dwelt longer on the lowly subject, relating to the flesh, and speaks
<del>about Him</del> as about any righteous man. And see, he neither kept silence as to the doctrine
altogether, nor did he utter it; that on the one hand, he might raise their thoughts, and persuade
them to be perfect, and that they might not be deprived of the great doctrines; and
on the other, that he might not overwhelm their minds.</p>
<p>“Of whom,” he says, “we have many things to say and hard to be explained, seeing ye
are dull of hearing.” Because they do not hear, the doctrine is “hard to be explained.” For
when one has to do with men who do not go along with him nor mind the things that are
spoken, he cannot well explain the subject to them.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one of you that stand here, is puzzled, and thinks it a hard case, that
owing to the Hebrews, he himself is hindered from hearing the more perfect doctrines. Nay
rather, I think that perhaps here also except a few, there are many such <del>as they</del>, so that
this may be said concerning yourselves also: but for the sake of those few I will speak.</p>
<p>Did he then keep entire silence, or did he resume the subject again in what follows; and
do the same as in the Epistle to the Romans? For there too, when he had first stopped the
mouths of the gainsayers, and said, “Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against
God?” ( Rom. ix. 20 ), he then subjoined the solution. And for my own part I think that he
was not even altogether silent, and yet did not speak it out, in order to lead the hearers to a

<pb n="758"/>
longing <del>for the knowledge</del>. For having mentioned <del>the subject</del>, and said that certain great
things were stored up in the doctrine, see how he frames his reproof in combination with
panegyric.</p>
<p>For this is ever a part of Paul’s wisdom, to mix painful things with kind ones. Which
he also does in the Epistle to the Galatians, saying, “Ye did run well; who did hinder you?”
( Gal. v. 7.) And, “Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain” ( Gal. iii. 4
), and, “I have confidence in you in the Lord.” ( Gal. v. 10.) Which he says also to these
<del>Hebrews</del>, “But we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation.”
( c. vi. 9.) For these two things he effects, he does not overstrain them, nor suffer them to
fall back; for if the examples of others are sufficient to arouse the hearer, and to lead him to
emulation; when a man has himself for an example and is bidden to emulate himself, the
possibility follows at the same time. He therefore shows this also, and does not suffer them
to fall back as men utterly condemned, nor as being alway evil, but <del>says</del> that they were
once even good; ( ver. 12 ) for “when for the time ye ought to be teachers,” he says. Here he
shows that they had been believers a long while, and he shows also that they ought to instruct
others.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> At all events observe him continually travailing to introduce the discourse concerning
the High Priest, and still putting it off. For hear how he began: “Having a great High Priest
that is passed into the heavens” ( c. iv. 14 ); and omitting to say how He was great, he says
again, “For every High Priest taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining
to God.” ( c. v. 1.) And again, “So Christ also glorified not Himself to be made an
High Priest.” ( c. v. 5 ) And again after saying, “Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech” ( c. v. 6 ), he again puts off <del>the subject</del>, saying, “Who in the days of His
Flesh offered prayers and supplications.” ( c. v. 7.) When therefore he had been so many
times repulsed, he says, as if excusing himself, The blame is with you. Alas! how great a
difference! When they ought to be teaching others, they are not even simply learners, but
the last of learners. ( Ver. 12 ), “For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
again that some one2853 teach you again which be the first principles2854 of the oracles of
God.” Here he means the Human Nature <del>of Christ</del>. For as in external literature it is necessary
to learn the elements first, so also here they were first taught concerning the human
nature.</p>
<p>Thou seest what is the cause of his uttering lowly things. So Paul did to the Athenians
also, discoursing and saying, “The times of this ignorance God winked at: but now commandeth
all men everywhere to repent, because He hath appointed a day in the which He
<note type="footnote">2853 τινα. The common editions have τίνα, “that one teach you which be,” U+0026c., as is read in the received
version of the Epistle, where Lachman adopts the reading τίνα</note>
<note type="footnote">2854 “the elements of the beginning.”</note>

<pb n="759"/>
will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained, whereof He
hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.” ( Acts xvii.
30, 31 .) Therefore, if he says anything lofty, he expresses it briefly, while the lowly statements
are scattered about in many parts of the Epistle. And thus too he shows the lofty; since the
very lowliness <del>of what is said</del> forbids the suspicion that these things relate to the Divine
Nature. So here also the safe ground was kept.2855</p>
<p>But what produces this dullness? This he pointed out especially in the Epistle to the
Corinthians, saying, “For whereas there is among you envy and strife and divisions, are ye
not carnal?” ( 1 Cor. iii. 3.) But observe, I beseech you, his great wisdom, how he always
deals according to the distempers before him. For there the weakness arose more from ignorance,
or rather from sin; but here not from sins only, but also from continual afflictions.
Wherefore he also uses expressions calculated to show the difference, not saying, “ye are
become carnal,” but “dull”: in that case “carnal,” but in this the pain is greater. For they <del>the
Corinthians</del> indeed were not able to endure <del>his reproof</del>, because they were carnal: but
these were able. For in saying, “Seeing ye are become dull of hearing” ( c. v. 11 ), he shows
that formerly they were sound in health, and were strong, fervent in zeal, which he also afterwards
testifies respecting them.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> “And are become such as have need of milk, not of strong meat.” He always calls
the lowly doctrine “milk,” both in this place and in the other. “When,” he says, “for <del>i.e.
“because of”</del> the time ye ought to be teachers”: because of that very thing, namely the time,
for which ye ought especially to be strong, for this especially ye are become backsliding.
Now he calls it “milk,” on account of its being suited to the more simple. But to the more
perfect it is injurious, and the dwelling on these things is hurtful. So that it is not fitting that
matters of the Law should be introduced2856 now or the comparison made from them, <del>such
as</del> that He was an High Priest, and offered sacrifice, and needed crying and supplication.
Wherefore see how these things are unhealthful2857 to “us”; but at that time they nourished
them being by no means unhealthful to them.</p>
<p>So then the oracles of God are true nourishment. “For I will give unto them,” he saith,
“not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.”
( Amos viii. 11.)</p>
<p>“I gave you milk to drink, and not meat” ( 1 Cor. iii. 2 ); He did not say, I fed you,
showing that such <del>nourishment</del> as this is not food, but that <del>the case is</del> like that of little
<note type="footnote">2855 That is, he took care to provide against being understood to refer to His Divine Nature, when he said
lowly things concerning Christ.</note>
<note type="footnote">2856 The allowing the observances of the law, as well as the dwelling thus on the human characteristics of
our Lord, were suited for the beginners, but would be injurious to us.</note>

<pb n="760"/>
children who cannot be fed with bread. For such have not drink given them, but their food
is to them instead of drink.</p>
<p>Moreover he did not say, “ye have need,” but “ye are become such as have need of milk
and not of strong meat.” That is, ye willed <del>it</del>; ye have reduced yourselves to this, to this
need.</p>
<p>Ver. 13. “For every one that partaketh of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness:
for he is a babe.” What is “the Word <del>doctrine</del> of righteousness”? He seems to me here to
hint at conduct also. That which Christ also said, “Except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees” ( Matt. v. 20 ), this he says likewise, “unskilled
in the word of righteousness,” that is, he that is unskilled in the philosophy that is above, is
unable to embrace a perfect and exact life.2858 Or else by “righteousness” he here means
Christ, and the high doctrine concerning Him.</p>
<p>That they then were “become dull,” he said; but from what cause, he did not add, leaving
it to themselves to know it, and not wishing to make his discourse hard to bear. But in the
case of the Galatians he both “marveled” ( Gal. i. 6 ) and “stood in doubt” ( Gal. iv. 20 ),
which tends much more to encourage, as <del>it is the language</del> of one who would never have
expected that this should happen. For this is [what] the doubting <del>implies</del>.</p>
<p>Thou seest that there is another infancy, Thou seest that there is another full age.2859
Let us become of “full age” in this sense: It is in the power even of those who are children,
and the young to come to that “full age”: for it is not of nature, but of virtue.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Ver. 14. “But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age <del>perfect</del>, even them
who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” Those had
not “their senses exercised,” nor did they “know good and evil.” He is not speaking now
concerning life <del>conduct</del>, when he says “to discern good and evil,” for this is possible and
easy for every man to know, but concerning doctrines that are wholesome and sublime, and
those that are corrupted and low. The babe knows not how to distinguish bad and good
food. Oftentimes at least it even puts dirt into its mouth, and takes what is hurtful; and it
does all things without judgment; but not <del>so</del> the full grown man. Such <del>babes</del> are they
who lightly listen to everything, and give up their ears indiscriminately: which seems to me
to blame these <del>Hebrews</del> also, as being lightly “carried about,” and now giving themselves
to these, now to those. Which he also hinted near the end <del>of the Epistle</del>, saying, “Be not
carried aside by divers and strange doctrines.” ( c. xiii. 9.) This is the meaning of “to discern
good and evil.” “For the mouth tasteth meat, but the soul trieth words.” ( Job xxxiv. 3.)</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Let us then learn this lesson. Do not, when thou hearest that a man is not a Heathen
nor a Jew, straightway believe him to be a Christian; but examine also into all the other
<note type="footnote">2858 ἄ κρον καὶ ἠκριβωμένον</note>
<note type="footnote">2859 τελειότης</note>

<pb n="761"/>
points; for even Manichæans, and all the heresies, have put on this mask, in order thus to
deceive the more simple. But if we “have the senses” of the soul “exercised to discern both
good and evil,” we are able to discern such <del>teachers</del>.</p>
<p>But how do our “senses” become “exercised”? By continual hearing; by experience of
the Scriptures. For when we set forth the error of those <del>Heretics</del>, and thou hearest today
and to-morrow; and provest that it is not right, thou hast learnt the whole, thou hast known
the whole: and even if thou shouldest not comprehend to-day, thou wilt comprehend tomorrow.</p>
<p>“That have,” he says, their “senses exercised.” Thou seest that it is needful to exercise
our hearing by divine studies, so that they may not sound strangely. “Exercised,” saith he,
“for discerning,” that is, to be skilled.</p>
<p>One man says, that there is no Resurrection; and another looks for none of the things
to come; another says there is a different God; another that He has His beginning from
Mary. And see at once how they have all fallen away from want of moderation,2860 some
by excess, others by defect. As for instance, the first Heresy of all was that of Marcion; this
introduced another different God, who has no existence.2861 See the excess. After this that
of Sabellius, saying that the Son and the Spirit and the Father are One.2862 Next that of
Marcellus and Photinus, setting forth the same things. Moreover that of Paul of Samosata,
saying that He had His beginning from Mary. Afterwards that of the Manichæans; for this
is the most modern of all. After these the heresy of Arius. And there are others too.</p>
<p>And on this account have we received the Faith, that we might not be compelled to attack
innumerable heresies, and to deal with them, but whatever any man might have endeavored
either to add or take away, that we might consider spurious. For as those who give the
standards do not oblige <del>people</del> to busy themselves about measures innumerable, but bid
them keep to what is given them; so also in the case of doctrines.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But no man is willing to give heed to the Scriptures. For if we did give heed, not
only should we not be ourselves entangled by deceit, but we should also set others free who
are deceived, and should draw them out of dangers. For the strong soldier is not only able
to help himself, but also to protect his comrade, and to free him from the malice of the enemy.
But as it is, some do not even know that there are any Scriptures. Yet the Holy Spirit indeed
made so many wise provisions in order that they might be safely kept.</p>
<p>And look at it from the first, that ye may learn the unspeakable love of God. He inspired
the blessed Moses; He engraved the tables, He detained him on the mount forty days; and
again as many <del>more</del> to give the Law. And after this He sent prophets who suffered woes
<note type="footnote">2860 ἐ ξ ἀμετρίας</note>
<note type="footnote">2861 Cf. St. Irenæus, iv. 33. 2, p. 405, O.T.</note>

innumerable. War came on; they slew them all, they cut them to pieces, the books were
burned. Again, He inspired another admirable man to publish them, Ezra I mean, and
caused them to be put together from the remains. And after this He arranged that they
should be translated by the seventy. They did translate them. Christ came, He receives them;
the Apostles disperse them among men. Christ wrought signs and wonders.</p>
<p>What then after so great painstaking? The Apostles also wrote, even as Paul likewise
said, “they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”
( 1 Cor. x. 11.) And again Christ said, “Ye do err not knowing the Scriptures” ( Matt. xxii.
29 ): and again Paul said, “That through patience and comfort of the Scriptures we may have
hope.” ( Rom. xv. 4.) And again, “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable.”
( 2 Tim. iii. 16.) And “let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.” ( Col. iii. 16.) And
the prophet, “he shall meditate in His Law day and night” ( Ps. i. 2 ), and again in another
place, “Let all thy communication be in the law of the Most High.” ( Ecclus. ix. 15.) And
again, “How sweet are Thy words unto my throat.” (He said not to my hearing, but to my
“throat”); “more than honey and the honeycomb to my mouth.” ( Ps. cxix. 103.) And Moses
says, “Thou shalt meditate in them continually, when thou risest up, when thou sittest, when
thou liest down.” ( Deut. vi. 7.) “Be in them” ( 1 Tim. iv. 15 ), saith he. And innumerable
things one might say concerning them. But notwithstanding, after so many things there are
some who do not even know that there are Scriptures at all. For this cause, believe me,
nothing sound, nothing profitable comes from us.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> Yet, if any one wished to learn military affairs, of necessity he must learn the military
laws. And if any one sought to learn navigation or carpentry or anything else, of necessity
he must learn the <del>principles</del> of the art. But in this case they will not do anything of
the kind, although this is a science which needs much wakeful attention. For that it too is
an art which needs teaching, hear the prophet saying, “Come, ye children, hearken unto
me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” ( Ps. xxxiv. 11.) It follows therefore certainly that
the fear of God needs teaching. Then he says, “What man is he that desireth life?” ( Ps. xxxiv.
12.) He means the life yonder; and again, “Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from
speaking guile; de part from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it.” ( Ps. xxxiv. 13,
14.)</p>
<p>Do you know indeed who said these things, a prophet or a historian, or an apostle, or
an evangelist? For my own part I do not think you do, except a few. Yea and these themselves
again, if we bring forward a testimony from some other place, will be in the same case as
the rest of you. For see, I repeat the same statement expressed in other words. “Wash ye,
make you clean, put away your wickedness from your souls before Mine eyes, learn to do
well, seek out judgment. Keep thy tongue from evil, and do good: learn to do well.” ( Isa. i.
16, 17.) Thou seest that virtue needs to be taught? For this one says, “I will teach you the
fear of the Lord,” and the other, “Learn to do well.”</p>

<pb n="763"/>
<p>Now then do you know where these words are? For myself I do not think you do, except
a few. And yet every week these things are read to you twice or even three times: and the
reader when he goes up <del>to the desk</del> first says whose the book is, <del>the book</del> of such a
prophet, and then says what he says, so that it shall be more intelligible to you and you may
not only know the contents of the Book, but also the reason of the writings, and who spake
these things. But all in vain; all to no purpose. For your zeal is spent on things of this life,
and of things spiritual no account is made. Therefore not even those matters turn out according
to your wishes, but there also are many difficulties. For Christ says, “Seek ye the
Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you.” ( Matt. vi. 33.) These things
He said, shall also be given in the way of addition: but we have inverted the order and seek
the earth and the good things which are in the earth, as if those other <del>heavenly</del> things were
to be given us in addition. Therefore we have neither the one nor the other. Let us then at
last wake up and become coveters of the things which shall be hereafter; for so these also
will follow. For it is not possible that he who seeks the things that relate to God, should not
also attain human [blessings]. It is the declaration of the Truth itself which says this. Let us
not then act otherwise, but let us hold fast to the counsel of Christ, lest we fail of all. But
God is able to give you compunction and to make you better, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, power, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily IX.</head>
<p>Hebrews vi. 1–3</p>
<p>“Therefore leaving the principles of the Doctrine of Christ,2863 let us go on unto perfection,
not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God;
of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands; and of resurrection of the dead,
and of eternal judgment. And this we will do, if God permit.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> You have heard how much Paul found fault with the Hebrews for wishing to be always
learning about the same things. And with good reason: “For when for the time ye
ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the elements of the first
principles2864 of the oracles of God.” ( c. v. 12.)</p>
<p>I am afraid that this might fitly be said to you also, that “when for the time ye ought to
be teachers,” ye do not maintain the rank of learners, but ever hearing the same things, and
on the same subjects, you are in the same condition as if you heard no one. And if any man
should question you, no one will be able to answer, except a very few who may soon be
counted.</p>
<p>But this is no trifling loss. For oftentimes when the teacher wishes to go on further, and
to touch on higher and more mysterious themes, the want of attention in those who are to
be taught prevents.</p>
<p>For just as in the case of a grammar-master, if a boy though hearing continually the first
elements does not master them, it will be necessary for him to be continually dinning the
same things into the boy, and he will not leave off teaching, until the boy has been able to
learn them accurately; for it is great folly to lead him on to other things, without having put
the first well into him; so too in the Church, if while we constantly say the same things you
learn nothing more, we shall never cease saying the same things.</p>
<p>For if our preaching were a matter of display and ambition, it would have been right to
jump from one subject to another and change about continually, taking no thought for you,
but only for your applauses. But since we have not devoted our zeal to this, but our labors
are all for your profit, we shall not cease discoursing to you on the same subjects, till you
succeed in learning them. For I might have said much about Gentile superstition, and about
the Manichæans, and about the Marcionists, and by the grace of God have given them heavy
blows, but this sort of discourse is out of season. For to those who do not yet know accurately
<note type="footnote">2863 τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ. Literally, “the discourse of the beginning of Christ” ; but presently
St. Chrys. substitutes for this, ἡ ἀρχὴ τοῦ λόγου, “the beginning of the doctrine, ” as the words are translated in
our version.</note>
<note type="footnote">2864 τὰ στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς</note>

<pb n="765"/>
their own affairs, to those who have not yet learned that to be covetous is evil, who would
utter such discourses as those, and lead them on to other subjects before the time?</p>
<p>We then shall not cease to say the same things, whether ye be persuaded or not. We fear
however, that by continually saying the same things, if ye hearken not, we may make the
condemnation heavier for the disobedient.</p>
<p>I must not however say this in regard to you all; for I know many who are benefited by
their coming here, who might with justice cry out against those others, as insidiously injuring
them2865 by their ignorance and inattention. But not even so will they be injured. For
hearing the same things continually is useful even to those who know them, since by often
hearing what we know we are more deeply affected. We know, for instance, that Humility
is an excellent thing, and that Christ often discoursed about it; but when we listen to the
words themselves and the reflections made upon them, we are yet more affected, even if we
hear them ten thousand times.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> It is then a fitting time for us also to say now to you, “Wherefore leaving the beginning
of the doctrine of Christ, let us go unto perfection.”</p>
<p>What is “the beginning of the doctrine”?2866 He goes on to state it himself, saying, “not
laying again” (these are his words) “the foundation of repentance from dead works, and
faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands, of the resurrection
of the dead, and of eternal judgment.”</p>
<p>But if this be “the Beginning,” what else is our doctrine save to repent “from dead works,”
and through the Spirit to receive “the faith,”2867 in “the resurrection of the dead, and
eternal judgment”? But what is “the Beginning”? “The Beginning,” he says, is nothing else
than this, when there is not a strict life. For as it is necessary to instruct one who is entering
on the study of grammar, in the Elements2868 first, so also must the Christian know these
things accurately, and have no doubt concerning them. And should he again have need of
teaching, he has not yet the foundation. For one who is firmly grounded ought to be fixed
and to stand steady, and not be moved about. But if one who has been catechised and baptized
is going ten years afterwards to hear again about the Faith, and that we ought to “believe”
in “the resurrection of the dead,” he does not yet have the foundation, he is again seeking
after the beginning of the Christian religion. For that the Faith is the foundation, and the
rest the building, hear him <del>the Apostle</del> saying; “I have laid the foundation and another
<note type="footnote">2865 ἐ νεδοευόντων αὐτοὺς</note>
<note type="footnote">2866 ἡ ἀρχὴ τοῦ λόγου</note>
<note type="footnote">2867 The Faith; πίστις with the article in this place and a little below means the Creed; as we say “the Belief.”
[Yet it would be impossible to substitute the word “Creed” — “Creed in the resurrection.” U+0026c. What is meant
is that Christian belief which finds expression in the Creed, as well as elsewhere.—F.G.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2868 or “the letters.”</note>

<pb n="766"/>
buildeth thereupon.” ( 1 Cor. iii. 10.) “If any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble.” ( 1 Cor. iii. 12.)</p>
<p>“Not laying again” (he says) “the foundation of repentance from dead works.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But what is, “let us go on unto perfection”? Let us henceforth proceed (he means)
even to the very roof, that is, let us have the best life. For as in the case of the letters the Alpha2869
involves the whole, and as the foundation, the whole building, so also does full assurance
concerning the Faith involve purity of life. And without this it is not possible to be
a Christian, as without foundations there can be no building; nor skill in literature without
the letters. Still if one should be always going round about the letters, or if about the
foundation, not about the building, he will never gain anything.</p>
<p>Do not however think that the Faith is depreciated by being called elementary: for it is
indeed the whole power: for when he says, “For every one that useth milk is unskilled in the
word of righteousness, for he is a babe” ( c. v. 13 ), it is not this which he calls “milk.” But
to be still doubting about these things is <del>a sign</del> of a mind feeble, and needing many discourses.
For these are the wholesome doctrines. For we call him “a perfect man” <del>i.e. “of
full age”</del> who with the faith has a right life; but if any one have faith, yet does evil, and is in
doubt concerning <del>the faith</del> itself, and brings disgrace on the doctrine, him we shall with
reason call “a babe,” in that he has gone back again to the beginning. So that even if we have
been ten thousand years in the faith, yet are not firm in it, we are babes; when we show a
life not in conformity with it; when we are still laying a foundation.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> But besides <del>their way of</del> life he brings another charge also against these <del>Hebrews</del>,
as being shaken to and fro, and needing “to lay a foundation of repentance from dead works.”
For he who changes from one to another, giving up this, and choosing that, ought first to
condemn this, and to be separated from the system, and then to pass to the other. But if he
intends again to lay hold on the first, how shall he touch the second?</p>
<p>What then of the Law (he says)? We have condemned it, and again we run back to it.
This is not a shifting about, for here also <del>under the Gospel</del> we have a law. “Do we then”
(he says) “make void the law through faith? God forbid, yea we establish the Law.” ( Rom.
iii. 31.) I was speaking concerning evil deeds. For he that intends to pursue virtue ought to
condemn wickedness first, and then go in pursuit of it. For repentance cannot prove2870
them clean. For this cause they were straightway baptized, that what they were unable to
accomplish by themselves, this might be effected by the grace of Christ. Neither then does
repentance suffice for purification, but men must first receive baptism. At all events, it was
necessary to come to baptism, having condemned the sins thereby and given sentence against
them.</p>

<p>But what is “the doctrine of baptisms”? Not as if there were many baptisms, but one
only.2871 Why then did he express it in the plural? Because he had said, “not laying again a
foundation of repentance.” For if he again baptized them and catechised them afresh, and
having been baptized at the beginning2872 they were again taught what things ought to be
done and what ought not, they would remain perpetually incorrigible.</p>
<p>“And of laying on of hands.” For thus did they receive the Spirit, “when Paul had laid
his hands on them” ( Acts xix. 6 ), it is said.</p>
<p>“And of the resurrection of the dead.” For this is both effected in baptism, and is affirmed
in the confession.</p>
<p>“And of eternal judgment.” But why does he say this? Because it was likely that, having
already believed, they would either be shaken <del>from their faith</del>, or would lead evil and
slothful lives, he says, “be wakeful.”2873</p>
<p>It is not open to them to say, If we live slothfully we will be baptized again, we will be
catechised again, we will again receive the Spirit; even if now we fall from the faith, we shall
be able again by being baptized, to wash away our sins, and to attain to the same state as
before. Ye are deceived (he says) in supposing these things.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Ver. 4, 5. “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted
of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good
word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them
again unto repentance, crucifying2874 to themselves the Son of God afresh, and putting Him
to an open shame.”</p>
<p>And see how putting them to shame,2875 and forbiddingly he begins. “Impossible.” No
longer (he says) expect that which is not possible; (For he said not, It is not seemly, or, It is
not expedient, or, It is not lawful, but “impossible,” so as to cast <del>them</del> into despair), if ye
have once been altogether enlightened.</p>
<p>Then he adds, “and have tasted of the heavenly gift. If ye have tasted” (he says) “of the
heavenly gift,” that is, of forgiveness. “And been made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and
tasted the good word of God” (he is speaking here of the doctrine) “and the powers of the
world to come” (what powers is he speaking of? either the working of miracles, or “the
earnest of the Spirit”— 2 Cor. i. 22 ) “and have fallen away, to renew them again unto repentance,

shame.” “Renew them,” he says, “unto repentance,” that is, by repentance, for unto repentance
is by repentance. What then, is repentance excluded? Not repentance, far from it! But the
renewing again by the laver.2876 For he did not say, “impossible” to be renewed “unto repentance,”
and stop, but added how “impossible, <del>by</del> crucifying afresh.”</p>
<p>To “be renewed,” that is, to be made new, for to make men new is <del>the work</del> of the
laver only: for (it is said) “thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle’s.” ( Ps. ciii. 5.) But it is
<del>the work of</del> repentance, when those who have been made new, have afterwards become
old through sins, to set them free from this old age, and to make them strong.2877 To bring
them to that former brightness however, is not possible; for there the whole was Grace.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> “Crucifying to themselves,” he says, “the Son of God afresh, and putting Him to an
open shame.” What he means is this. Baptism is a Cross, and “our old man was crucified
with <del>Him</del>” ( Rom. vi. 6 ), for we were “made conformable to the likeness of His death” (
Rom. vi. 5; Philip. iii. 10 ), and again, “we were buried therefore with Him by baptism into
death.” ( Rom. vi. 4 .) Wherefore, as it is not possible that Christ should be crucified a second
time, for that is to “put Him to an open shame.”2878 For “if death shall no more have
dominion over Him” ( Rom. vi. 9 ), if He rose again, by His resurrection becoming superior
to death; if by death He wrestled with and overcame death, and then is crucified again, all
those things become a fable and a mockery.2879 He then that baptizeth2880 a second time,
crucifies Him again.</p>
<p>But what is “crucifying afresh”? <del>It is</del> crucifying over again. For as Christ died on the
cross, so do we in baptism, not as to the flesh, but as to sin. Behold two deaths. He died as
to the flesh; in our case the old man was buried, and the new man arose, made conformable
to the likeness of His death. If therefore it is necessary to be baptized <del>again2881</del>, it is necessary
that this same <del>Christ</del> should die again. For baptism is nothing else than the putting
to death of the baptized, and his rising again.</p>
<p>And he well said, “crucifying afresh unto themselves.” For he that does this, as having
forgotten the former grace,2882 and ordering his own life carelessly, acts in all respects as if

there were another baptism. It behooves us therefore to take heed and to make ourselves
safe.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> What is, “having tasted of the heavenly gift”? it is, “of the remission of sins”: for this
is of God alone to bestow, and the grace is a grace once for all. “What then? shall we continue
in sin that grace may abound? Far from it!” ( Rom. vi. 1, 2.) But if we should be always going
to be saved by grace we shall never be good. For where there is but one grace, and we are
yet so indolent, should we then cease sinning if we knew that it is possible again to have our
sins washed away? For my part I think not.</p>
<p>He here shows that the gifts are many: and to explain it, Ye were counted worthy (he
says) of so great forgiveness; for he that was sitting in darkness, he that was at enmity, he
that was at open war, that was alienated, that was hated of God, that was lost, he having
been suddenly enlightened, counted worthy of the Spirit, of the heavenly gift, of adoption
as a son, of the kingdom of heaven, of those other good things, the unspeakable mysteries;
and who does not even thus become better, but while indeed worthy of perdition, obtained
salvation and honor, as if he had successfully accomplished great things; how could he be
again baptized?</p>
<p>On two grounds then he said that the thing was impossible, and he put the stronger
last: first, because he who has been deemed worthy of such <del>blessings</del>, and who has betrayed
all that was granted to him, is not worthy to be again renewed; neither2883 is it possible that
<del>Christ</del> should again be crucified afresh: for this is to “put Him to an open shame.”</p>
<p>There is not then any second laver: there is not <del>indeed</del>. And if there is, there is also a
third, and a fourth; for the former one is continually disannulled by the later, and this continually
by another, and so on without end.</p>
<p>“And tasted,” he says, “the good word of God”; and he does not unfold it; “and the
powers of the world to come,” for to live as Angels and to have no need of earthly things,
to know that this is the means of our introduction to the enjoyment of the worlds to come;
this may we learn through the Spirit, and enter into those sacred recesses.</p>
<p>What are “the powers of the world to come”? Life eternal, angelic conversation. Of these
we have already received the earnest through our Faith from the Spirit. Tell me then, if after
having been introduced into a palace, and entrusted with all things therein, thou hadst then
betrayed all, wouldest thou have been entrusted with them again?2884</p>

<note type="footnote">2884 The common texts add τὰ ἐκεῖ, “the things in heaven.” But St. Chrys. is speaking of present privileges

<pb n="770"/>
<p><del>8.</del> What then (you say)? Is there no repentance? There is repentance, but there is no
second baptism: but repentance there is, and it has great force, and is able to set free from
the burden of his sins, if he will, even him that hath been baptized much in sins, and to establish
in safety him who is in danger, even though he should have come unto the very depth
of wickedness. And this is evident from many places. “For,” says one, “doth not he that
falleth rise again? or he that turneth away, doth not he turn back to <del>God</del>?” ( Jer. viii. 4.) It
is possible, if we will, that Christ should be formed in us again: for hear Paul saying, “My
little children of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you.” ( Gal. iv. 19.)
Only let us lay hold on repentance.</p>
<p>For behold the love of God to man! We ought on every ground to have been punished
at the first; in that having received the natural law, and enjoyed innumerable blessings, we
have not acknowledged our Master, and have lived an unclean life. Yet He not only has not
punished us, but has even made us partakers of countless blessings, just as if we had accomplished
great things. Again we fell away, and not even so does He punish us, but has given
medicine of repentance, which is sufficient to put away and blot out all our sins; only if we
knew the nature of the medicine, and how we ought to apply it.</p>
<p>What then is the medicine of Repentance and how is it made up? First, of the condemnation
of our own sins;2885 “For” (it is said) “mine iniquity have I not hid” ( Ps. xxxii. 5 );
and again, “I will confess against myself my lawlessness unto the Lord, and Thou forgavest
the iniquity of my heart.” And “Declare thou at the first thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.”
( Isa. xliii. 26.) And, “The righteous man is an accuser of himself at the first speaking.”
( Prov. xviii. 17 .)</p>
<p>Secondly, of great humbleness of mind: For it is like a golden chain; if one have hold of
the beginning, all will follow. Because if thou confess thy sin as one ought to confess, the
soul is humbled. For conscience turning it on itself2886 causeth it to be subdued.</p>
<p>Other things too must be added to humbleness of mind if it be such as the blessed
David knew, when he said, “A broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.” ( Ps. li.
17.) For that which is broken does not rise up, does not strike, but is ready to be ill-treated
and itself riseth not up. Such is contrition of heart: though it be insulted, though it be evil
entreated, it is quiet, and is not eager for vengeance.</p>
<p>And after humbleness of mind, there is need of intense prayers, of many tears, tears by
day, and tears by night: for, he says, “every night, will I wash my bed, I will water my couch
with my tears. I am weary with my groaning.” ( Ps. vi. 6.) And again, “For I have eaten ashes
as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.” ( Ps. cii. 9.)</p>
<note type="footnote">2885 The common texts add καὶ ἀπὸ ἐξαγορεύσεως, “and [of] from confession.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2886 συστρέφον</note>

<pb n="771"/>
<p>And after prayer thus intense, there is need of much almsgiving: for this it is which especially
gives strength to the medicine of repentance. And as there is a medicine among the
physicians’ helps which receives many herbs, but one is the essential, so also in case of repentance
this is the essential herb, yea, it may be everything. For hear what the Divine
Scripture says, “Give alms, and all things shall be clean.” ( Luke xi. 41 .) And again, “By
alms-giving and acts of faithfulness2887 sins are purged away.” ( Prov. xvi. 6.) And, “Water
will quench a flaming fire, and alms will do away with great sins.” ( Ecclus. iii. 30.)</p>
<p>Next not being angry with any one, not bearing malice; the forgiving all their trespasses.
For, it is said, “Man retaineth wrath against man, and yet seeketh healing from the Lord.”
( Ecclus. xxviii. 3.) “Forgive that ye may be forgiven.” ( Mark xi. 25.)</p>
<p>Also, the converting our brethren from their wandering. For, it is said,2888 “Go thou,
and convert thy brethren, that thy sins may be forgiven thee.” And from one’s being in close
relations with2889 the priests, “and if,” it is said, “a man hath committed sins it shall be forgiven
him.” ( Jas. v. 15.) To stand forward in defense of those who are wronged. Not to retain
anger: to bear all things meekly.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Now then, before you learned that it is possible to have our sins washed away by
means of repentance, were ye not in an agony, because there is no second laver, and were
ye not in despair of yourselves? But now that we have learned by what means repentance
and remission is brought to a successful issue, and that we shall be able entirely to escape,
if we be willing to use it aright, what forgiveness can we possibly obtain, if we do not even
enter on the thought of our sins? since if this were done, all would be accomplished.</p>
<p>For as he who enters the door, is within; so he who reckons up his own evils will also
certainly come to get them cured. But should he say, I am a sinner, without reckoning them
up specifically,2890 and saying, This and this sin have I committed, he will never leave off,
confessing indeed continually, but never caring in earnest for amendment. For should he
have laid down a beginning, all the rest will unquestionably follow too, if only in one point2891
he have shown a beginning: for in every case the beginning and the preliminaries are difficult.
This then let us lay as a foundation, and all will be smooth and easy.</p>

<p>Let us begin therefore, I entreat you, one with making his prayers intense: another with
continual weeping: another with downcast2892 countenance. For not even is this, which is
so small, unprofitable: for “I saw” (it is said) “that he was grieved and went downcast, and
I healed his ways.” ( Isa. lvii. 17, 18.)</p>
<p>But let us all humble our own souls by alms-giving and forgiving our neighbors their
trespasses, by not remembering injuries, nor avenging ourselves. If we continually reflect
on our sins, no external circumstances can make us elated: neither riches, nor power, nor
authority, nor honor; nay, even should we sit in the imperial chariot itself, we shall sigh
bitterly: Since even the blessed David was a King, and yet he said, “Every night I will wash
my bed,” <del>U+0026c.</del> ( Ps. vi. 6 ): and he was not at all hurt by the purple robe and the diadem: he
was not puffed up; for he knew himself to be a man, and inasmuch as his heart had been
made contrite, he went mourning.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> For what are all things human? Ashes and dust, and as it were spray before the
wind; a smoke and a shadow, and a leaf driven here and there; and a flower; a dream, and
a tale, and a fable, wind and air vainly puffed out and wasting away; a feather that hath no
stay, a stream flowing by, or if there be aught of more nothingness than these.</p>
<p>For, tell me, what dost thou esteem great? What dignity thinkest thou to be great? is it
that of the Consul? For the many think no greater dignity than that. He who is not Consul
is not a whit inferior to him who is in so great splendor, who is so greatly admired. Both
one and the other are of the same dignity; both of them alike, after a little while, are no more.</p>
<p>When was he made <del>Consul</del>? For how long a time? tell me: for two days? Nay, this
takes place even in dreams. But that is [only] a dream, you say. And what is this? For (tell
me) what is by day, is it <del>therefore</del> not a dream? Why do we not rather call these things a
dream? For as dreams when the day comes on are proved to be nothing: so these things also,
when the night comes on, are proved to be nothing. For night and day have received each
an equal portion of time, and have equally divided all duration. Therefore as in the day a
person rejoices not in what happened at night, so neither in the night is it possible for him
to reap the fruit of what is done in the day. Thou hast been made Consul? So was I in the
night; only I in the night, thou in the day. And what of this? Not even so hast thou any advantage
over me, except haply its being said, Such an one is Consul, and the pleasure that
springs from the words, gives him the advantage.</p>
<p>I mean something of this kind, for I will express it more plainly: if I say “Such an one
is Consul,” and bestow on him the name, is it not gone as soon as it is spoken? So also are
the things themselves; no sooner doth the Consul appear, than he is no more. But let us
suppose <del>that he is Consul</del> for a year, or two years, or three or four years. Where are they
who were ten times Consul? Nowhere.</p>
<note type="footnote">2892 κατηφεῖν, “seriousness.”</note>

<pb n="773"/>
<p>But Paul is not so. For he was, and also is living continually: he did not live one day,
nor two, nor ten, and twenty, nor thirty; nor ten and twenty, nor yet thirty years—and die.
Even the four hundredth year is now past, and still even yet is he illustrious, yea much more
illustrious than when he was alive. And these things indeed [are] on earth; but the glory of
the saints in heaven what word could set forth?</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you, let us seek this glory; let us pursue after it, that we may attain
it. For this is the true glory. Let us henceforth stand aloof from the things of this life, that
we may find grace and mercy in Christ Jesus our Lord: with whom to the Father, together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor and worship, now and for ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews vi. 7, 8</p>
<p>“For the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God. But if it bear2893 thorns
and briars it is rejected, and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Let us hear the oracles of God with fear, with fear and much trembling. For (it is
said) “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.” ( Ps. ii. 11.) But if
even our joy and our exultation ought to be “with trembling,” of what punishment are we
not worthy, if we listen not with terror to what is said, when the things spoken, as now, are
themselves fearful?</p>
<p>For having said that “it is impossible for those who have fallen away” to be baptized a
second time, and to receive remission through the laver, and having pointed out the awfulness
of the case, he goes on: “for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God.
But if it bear thorns and thistles, it is rejected,2894 and nigh unto cursing; whose end is to
be burned.”</p>
<p>Let us then fear, beloved! This threat is not Paul’s, these words are not of man: they are
of the Holy Ghost, of Christ that speaketh in him. Is there then any one that is clear from
these thorns? And even if we were clear, not even so ought we to be confident, but to fear
and tremble lest at any time thorns should spring up in us. But when we are “thorns and
thistles” through and through, whence (tell me) are we confident? And are becoming supine?
What is it which makes us inert? If “he that thinketh he standeth” ought to fear “lest he fall”;
for (he says) “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall” ( 1 Cor. x. 12 ); he
that falleth, how anxious ought he to be that he may rise up again! If Paul fears, “lest that
by any means, when he had preached to others, he himself should be a castaway” ( 1 Cor.
ix. 27 ); and he who had been so approved is afraid lest he should become disapproved:2895
<note type="footnote">2893 The received version is necessarily altered here: St. Chrysostom’s commentary will be more readily understood
if it is kept in mind that the exact translation would be as below: “the land which hath drunk in,” U+0026c.,
“partaketh of blessing,” U+0026c. “But if it bear thorns and thistles, it is reprobate, and nigh unto a curse, whose end
is for burning.” [There seems to be no need of this slight correction; the present participle of the Greek is even

<pb n="775"/>
what pardon shall we have who are already disapproved, if we have no fear, but fulfill our
Christianity as a custom, and for form’s sake. Let us then fear, beloved: “For the wrath of
God is revealed from heaven.” ( Rom. i. 18.) Let us fear, for it “is revealed” not “against impiety”
only, but “against all unrighteousness.” What is “against all unrighteousness”? [Against
all] both small and great.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> In this passage he intimates the lovingkindness of God towards man: and the
teaching [of the Gospel] he calls “rain”: and what he said above, “when for the time ye ought
to be teachers” ( c. v. 12 ), this he says here also. Indeed in many places the Scripture calls
the teaching “rain.” For (it says) “I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it”
( Isa. v. 6 ), speaking of “the vineyard.” The same which in another place it calls “a famine
of bread, and a thirst of water.” ( Amos viii. 11.) And again, “The river of God is full of waters.”
( Ps. lxv. 9.)</p>
<p>“For land,” he says, “which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it.” Here he shows
that they received and drank in the word, yea and often enjoyed this, and yet even so they
were not profited. For if (he means) thou hadst not been tilled, if thou hadst enjoyed no
rains, the evil would not have been so great. For (it is said) “If I had not come and spoken
unto them they had not had sin.” ( John xv. 22.) But if thou hast often drunk and received
<del>nourishment</del>, wherefore hast thou brought forth other things instead of fruits? For (it is
said) “I waited that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns.” ( Isa. v. 2.)</p>
<p>Thou seest that everywhere the Scripture calleth sins “thorns.” For David also saith, “I
was turned into mourning when a thorn was fixed in me.” ( Ps. xxxii. 4 , so LXX.) For it
does not simply come on us, but is fixed in; and even if but a little of it remain in, even if
we take it not out entirely, that little of itself in like manner causes pain, as in the case of a
thorn. And why do I say, ‘that little of itself’? Even after it has been taken out, it leaves therein
for a long time the pain of the wound. And much care and treatment is necessary, that we
may be perfectly freed from it. For it is not enough merely to take away the sin, it is necessary
also to heal the wounded place.</p>
<p>But I fear however lest the things said apply to us more than to others. “For,” he says,
“the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it.” We are ever drinking, ever
hearing, but “when the sun is risen” ( Matt. xiii. 6 ) we straightway lose our moisture, and
therefore bring forth thorns. What then are the thorns? Let us hear Christ saying, that “the
care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.”
( Matt. xiii. 22.)</p>
<note type="footnote">after testing, as in case of metals: which may take place, as St. Chrys. implies in this passage, either here or
hereafter; either for a time or for eternity.</note>

<p><del>3.</del> “For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,” he says, “and
bringeth forth meet herbs.” Because nothing is so meet as purity of life, nothing so suitable
as the best life, nothing so meet as virtue.</p>
<p>“And bringeth forth” (saith he) “herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth
blessing from God.” Here he says that God is the cause of all things, giving the heathen a
blow, who ascribed the production of fruits to the power of the earth. For (he says) it is not
the hands of the husbandman which stir up the earth to bear fruits, but the command from
God. Therefore he says, “receives blessing from God.”</p>
<p>And see how in speaking of the thorns, he said not, “bringing forth2896 thorns,” nor did
he use this word expressive of what is useful; but what? “Bearing”2897 <del>literally “putting
out”</del> “thorns,” as if one should say, “forcing out,” “throwing out.”</p>
<p>“Rejected” (he says) “and nigh unto cursing.” Oh! how great consolation in this word!
For he said “nigh unto cursing,” not “a curse.” Now he that hath not yet fallen into a curse,
but is come to be near <del>thereto</del>, may also come to be far off <del>therefrom</del>.</p>
<p>And not by this only did he encourage them, but also by what follows. For he did not
say “rejected and nigh unto cursing,” “which shall be burned,” but what? “Whose end is to
be burned,” if he continue <del>such</del> (he means) unto the end. So that, if we cut out and burn
the thorns, we shall be able to enjoy those good things innumerable and to become approved,
and to partake of blessing.</p>
<p>And with good reason did he call sin “a thistle,”2898 saying “that which beareth thorns
and thistles”; for on whatever side you lay hold on it, it wounds and stings, and it is unpleasant
even to look at.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Having therefore sufficiently rebuked them, and alarmed and wounded them, he
in turn heals them, so as not to cast them down too much, and make them supine. For he
that strikes one that is “dull,” makes him more dull. So then he neither flatters them
throughout, lest he should make them supine, nor does he wound them throughout, but
having inserted a little to wound them, he applies much to heal in what follows.</p>
<p>For what does he say? We speak not these things, as having condemned you, nor as
thinking you to be full of thorns, but fearing lest this should come to pass. For it is better to
terrify you by words, that ye may not suffer by the realities. And this is specially of Paul’s
wisdom.</p>
<p>Moreover he did not say, We think, or, we conjecture, or, we expect, or, we hope, but
what? ( Ver. 9 ) “But beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany
salvation, though we thus speak.” Which word he also used in writing to the Galatians:
<note type="footnote">2896 τίκτουσα</note>
<note type="footnote">2897 ἐ κφέρουσα</note>
<note type="footnote">2898 [τρίβολον, “a burr.”]</note>

<pb n="777"/>
“But I am persuaded of you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded.” ( Gal. v.
10.) For in that instance, inasmuch as they were greatly to be condemned, and he could not
praise them from things present, he does it from things future (“that ye will be none otherwise
minded,” he says): he said not, ye are, but “ye will be none otherwise minded.” But here he
encourages them from things present. “We are persuaded better things of you, beloved, and
things that accompany to salvation, though we thus speak.” And since he was not able to
say so much from things present, he confirms his consolation from things past; and says,</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and2899 the love, which ye
have showed toward His name, in that ye have ministered unto the saints and do minister.”
O how did he here restore their spirit, and give them fresh strength, by reminding them of
former things, and bringing them to the necessity of not supposing that God had forgotten.
(For he cannot but sin who is not fully assured concerning his hope, and says that God is
unrighteous. Accordingly he obliged them by all means to look forward to those future
things. For one who despairs of present things, and has given up exerting himself, may be
restored by <del>the prospect of</del> things future.) As he himself also said in writing to the Galatians,
“Ye did run well” ( Gal. v. 7 ): and again, “Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be
yet in vain.” ( Gal. iii. 4.)</p>
<p>And as in this place he puts the praise with the reproof, saying, “When for the time ye
ought to be teachers” ( c. v. 12 ), so also there, “I marvel that ye are so soon removed.” ( Gal.
i. 6.) With the reproof is the praise. For respecting great things we marvel, when they fail.
Thou seest that praise is concealed under the accusation and the blame. Nor does he say
this concerning himself only, but also concerning all. For he said not, I am persuaded, but
“we are persuaded better things of you,” even good things (he means). He says this either
in regard to matters of conduct, or to the recompense. In the next place, having said above,
that it is “rejected and nigh unto a curse,” and that it “shall be for burning,” he says, we do
not by any means speak this of you. “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and
love.” ( Ver. 10.)</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Why then did we say these things? ( Ver. 11, 12 ) “But we desire that everyone of
you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not
slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”</p>
<p>“We desire,” he says, and we do not therefore merely labor for, or even so far as words
go, wish this. But what? “We desire” that ye should hold fast to virtue, not as condemning
your former conduct (he means), but fearing for the future. And he did not say, ‘not as
condemning your former conduct, but your present; for ye have fainted, ye are become too
indolent’; but see how gently he indicated it, and did not wound them.</p>
<note type="footnote">2899 Sav. and Ben. here, and in other places where the text is cited, insert τοῦ κόπου, “the labor of love,” U+0026c.
These words are probably not part of the sacred text. They are not referred to by St. Chrysostom.</note>

<pb n="778"/>
<p>For what does he say? “But we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence
unto the end.” For this is the admirable part of Paul’s wisdom, that he does not expressly
show that they “had” given in, that they “had” become negligent. For when he says, “We
desire that every one of you”—it is as if one should say, I wish thee to be always in earnest;
and such as thou wert before, such to be now also, and for the time to come. For this made
his reproof more gentle and easy to be received.</p>
<p>And he did not say, “I will,” which would have been expressive of the authority of a
teacher, but what is expressive of the affection of a father, and what is more than “willing,”
“we desire.” All but saying, Pardon us, even if we say what is distasteful.</p>
<p>“We desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of
your hope unto the end.” Hope (he means) carries us through: it recovers us again. Be not
wearied out, do not despair, lest your hope be in vain. For he that worketh good hopeth also
good, and never despairs of himself.</p>
<p>“That ye may not become dull.”2900 Still2901 “become”; and yet he said above, “seeing
ye are become dull2902 of hearing.” ( c. v. 11.) Ob serve however how he limited the dullness
to the hearing. And here he hints the very same thing; instead of ‘that ye may not continue
in it,’ he says <del>this</del>. But again he leads on to that future time for which they were not yet
responsible; saying in effect “that ye may not become too slothful”: since for that which is
not yet come we could not be responsible. For he who in regard to the present time is exhorted
to be in earnest, as being remiss, will perhaps become even more slothful, but he who
is exhorted with reference to the future, not so.</p>
<p>“We desire” (he says) “that every one of you.” Great is his affection for them: he cares
equally for great and small; moreover he knows all, and overlooks no one, but shows the
same tender care for each, and equal value for all: from which cause also he the rather persuaded
them to receive what was distasteful in his words.</p>
<p>“That ye be not slothful,” he says. For as inactivity hurts the body, so also inactivity as
to what is good renders the soul more supine and feeble.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> “But followers” (he says) “of them, who through faith and patience inherit the
promises.” And who they are, he tells afterwards. He said before, “Imitate your own former
well-doings.” Then, lest they should say, What? He leads them back to the Patriarch:
bringing before them examples of well-doing indeed from their own history,2903 but of the
<note type="footnote">2900 νωθροὶ. The same word is translated “slothful” and “dull” in these two passages. It means “sluggish,”
“stupid,” “without quickness in perception or energy in action.”</note>

<pb n="779"/>
thought of being forsaken, from the Patriarch; that they might not suppose that they were
disregarded and forsaken as worthy of no account, but might know that it is <del>the portion</del>
of the very noblest men to make the journey of life through trials; and that God has thus
dealt with great and admirable men.</p>
<p>Now we ought (he says) to bear all things with patience: for this also is believing:
whereas if He say that He gives and thou immediately receivest, how hast thou also believed?
Since in that case this is no longer of thy faith, but of Me, the Giver. But if I say that I give,
and give after an hundred years, and thou hast not despaired; then hast thou accounted Me
worthy to be believed, then thou hast the right opinion concerning Me. Thou seest that oftentimes
unbelief arises not from want of hope only, but also from faintheartedness, and
want of patience, not from condemning him who made the promise.</p>
<p>“For God” (he says) “is not unrighteous to forget your love” and the zeal “which ye have
showed toward His Name, in that ye have ministered unto the saints, and do minister.” He
testifies great things of them, not deeds only; but deeds done with alacrity, which he says
also in another place, “and not only so, but they gave themselves also to the Lord and to us.”
( 2 Cor. viii. 5.)</p>
<p>“Which” (he says) “ye have showed toward His Name, in that ye have ministered to the
saints, and do minister.” See how again he soothes them, by adding “and do minister.” Still
even at this time (he says) ye are ministering, and he raises them up by showing that they
had done [what they did] not to them [the saints], but to God. “Which ye have showed” (he
says); and he said not “unto the saints,” but “towards God,” for this is “toward His Name.”
It is for His Name’s sake (he means) that ye have done all. He therefore who has the enjoyment
from you of2904 so great zeal and love, will never despise you nor forget you.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Hearing these things, let us, I beseech you, “minister to the saints.” For every believer
is a saint in that he is a believer. Though he be a person living in the world, he is a saint.
“For” (he says) “the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife
by the husband.” ( 1 Cor. vii. 14.) See how the faith makes the saintship. If then we see even
a secular person in misfortune, let us stretch out a hand [to him]. Let us not be zealous for
those only who dwell in the mountains; they are indeed saints both in manner of life and
in faith; these others however are saints by their faith, and many of them also in manner of
life. Let us not, if we see a monk <del>cast</del> into prison, in that case go in; but if it be a secular
person, refuse to go in. He also is a saint and a brother.</p>
<p>What then (you say) if he be unclean and polluted? Listen to Christ saying, “Judge not
that ye be not judged.” ( Matt. vii. 1.) Do thou act for God’s sake. Nay, what am I saying?
Even if we see a heathen in misfortune, we ought to show kindness to him, and to every
man without exception who is in misfortunes, and much more to a believer who is in the
<note type="footnote">2904 ἀ πολαύων</note>

<pb n="780"/>
world. Listen to Paul, saying, “Do good unto all men, but especially to those who are of the
household of faith.” ( Gal. vi. 10.)</p>
<p>But I know not whence this [notion] has been introduced, or whence this custom hath
prevailed. For he that only seeks after the solitaries, and is willing to do good to them alone,
and with regard to others on the contrary is over-curious in his enquiries, and says, ‘unless
he be worthy,2905 unless he be righteous, unless he work miracles, I stretch out no hand’;
<del>such an one</del> has taken away the greater part of charity,2906 yea and in time he will in turn
destroy the very thing itself. And yet that is charity,2907 <del>which is shown</del> towards sinners,
towards the guilty. For this is charity,2908 not the pitying those who have done well, but
those who have done wrong.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> And that thou mayest understand this, listen to the Parable: “A certain man” (it is
said) “went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves” ( Luke x. 30 , U+0026c.); and
when they had beaten him, they left him by the way-side, having badly bruised him. A certain
Levite came, and when he saw him, he passed by; A priest came, and when he saw him, he
hastened past; a certain Samaritan came, and bestowed great care upon him. For he “bound
up his wounds” ( Luke x. 34 ), dropped oil on them, set him upon his ass, “brought him to
the inn, said to the host, Take care of him” ( Luke x. 35 ); and (observe his great liberality),
“and I,” he says, “will give thee whatsoever thou shalt expend.” Who then is his neighbor?
“He,” it is said, “that showed mercy on him. Go thou then also,” He says, “and do likewise.”
( Luke x. 37 .) And see what a parable He spake. He said not that a Jew did <del>so and so</del> to a
Samaritan, but that a Samaritan showed all that liberality. Having then heard these things,
let us not care only for “those that are of the household of faith” ( Gal. vi. 10 ), and neglect
others. So then also thou, if thou see any one in affliction, be not curious to enquire further.
His being in affliction involves a just claim on thy aid. 2909 For if when thou seest an ass
choking thou raisest him up, and dost not curiously enquire whose he is, much more about
a man one ought not to be over-curious in enquiring whose he is. He is God’s, be he heathen
or be he Jew; since even if he is an unbeliever, still he needs help. For if indeed it had been
committed to thee to enquire and to judge, thou wouldst have well said thus, but, as it is,
<note type="footnote">2905 ἐ ὰ ν μἡ ᾖ ἄξιος, ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ δίκαιος. Mr. Field retains μὴ in these clauses, in accordance with the common
editions, though all the mss. omit the negative in the first clause, and the best mss. in the second also, and it
was not read by Mutianus. If it be omitted, the passage would run thus, “and says, If he be worthy, if he be
righteous [I will help him]. Unless he work miracles I stretch out no hand,” U+0026c.; which seems to give a good
sense.</note>

his misfortune does not suffer thee to search out these things. For if even about men in good
health it is not right to be over-curious, nor to be a busybody in other men’s matters, much
less about those that are in affliction.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But on another view what <del>shall we say</del>? Didst thou see him in prosperity, in high
esteem, that thou shouldst say that he is wicked and worthless? But if thou seest him in affliction,
do not say that he is wicked. For when a man is in high credit, we fairly say these
things; but when he is in calamity, and needs help, it is not right to say that he is wicked.
For this is cruelty, inhumanity, and arrogance. Tell me what was ever more iniquitous than
the Jews. But nevertheless while God punished them, and that justly, yea, very justly, yet He
approved of those who had compassion on them, and those who rejoiced over them He
punished. ( Amos vi. 6.) For “they were not grieved,” it is said, “at the affliction of Joseph.”</p>
<p>And again it is said “Redeem <del>Ransom</del> those who are ready to be slain: spare not.” (
Prov. xxiv. 11.) (He said not, enquire curiously, and learn who he is; and yet, for the most
part, they who are led away to execution are wicked,) for this especially is charity. For he
that doeth good to a friend, doeth it not altogether for God’s sake: but he that <del>doeth good</del>
to one unknown, this man acts purely for God’s sake. “Do not spare” thy money, even if it
be necessary to spend all, yet give.</p>
<p>But we, when we see persons in extreme distress,2910 bewailing themselves, suffering
things more grievous than ten thousand deaths, and oftentimes unjustly, we <del>I say</del> are
sparing of our money, and unsparing of our brethren; we are careful of lifeless things, but
neglect the living soul. And yet Paul says, “in meekness instruct those that oppose themselves,
if peradventure God should give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and
they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him, at
His will.” ( 2 Tim. ii. 25, 26.) “If peradventure,” he says; thou seest of how great long-suffering
the word is full.</p>
<p>Let us also imitate Him, and despair of no one. For the fishermen too, when they have
cast many times <del>suppose it</del>, have not succeeded; but afterwards having cast again, have
gained all. So we also expect that ye will all at once show to us ripe fruit. For the husbandman
too, after he has sown, waits one day or two days, and is a long while in expectation: and all
at once he sees the fruits springing up on every side. This we expect will take place in your
case also by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
and also to the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XI.</head>
<p>Hebrews vi. 13–16</p>
<p>“For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware
by Himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verily swear by
the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Having boldly reflected on the faults of the Hebrews, and sufficiently alarmed them,
he consoles them, first, by praises, and secondly (which also is the stronger ground), by the
<del>thought</del> that they would certainly attain the object of their hope. Moreover he draws his
consolation, not from things future, but again from the past, which indeed would the rather
persuade them. For as in the case of punishment, he alarms them rather by those <del>viz. things
future</del>, so also in the case of the prizes <del>set before them</del>, he encourages them by these <del>viz.
by things past</del>, showing <del>herein</del> God’s way of dealing. And that is, not to bring in what
has been promised immediately, but after a long time. And this He does, both to present
the greatest proof of His power, and also to lead us to Faith, that they who are living in
tribulation without having received the promises, or the rewards, may not faint under their
troubles.</p>
<p>And omitting all <del>the rest</del>, though he had many whom he might have mentioned, he
brought forward Abraham both on account of the dignity of his person, and because this
had occurred in a special way in his case.</p>
<p>And yet at the end of the Epistle he says, that “all these, having seen the promises afar
off, and having embraced them, received them not, that they without us should not be made
perfect.” ( c. xi. 13.) “For when God made promise to Abraham” (he says) “because He could
swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and
multiplying I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
promise.” ( c. xi. 39, 40.) How then does he say at the end <del>of the Epistle</del> that “he received
not the promises,” and here, that “after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise”?
How did he not receive? How did he obtain? He is not speaking of the same things in this
place and in the other, but makes the consolation twofold. God made promises to Abraham,
and after a long space of time He gave the things <del>spoken of</del> in this place, but those others
not yet.</p>
<p>“And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.” Seest thou that the
promise alone did not effect the whole, but the patient waiting as well? Here he alarms them,
showing that oftentimes a promise is thwarted through faintheartedness.2911 And this he
<note type="footnote">2911 ὀ λιγοψυχίαν</note>

<pb n="783"/>
had indeed shown through <del>the instance of</del> the <del>Jewish</del> people: for since they were fainthearted,
therefore they obtained not the promise. But now he shows the contrary by means
of Abraham. Afterwards near the end <del>of the Epistle</del> he proves something more also: <del>viz.</del>
that even though they had patiently endured, they did not obtain; and yet not even so are
they grieved.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “For men verily swear by the greater, and an Oath for confirmation is to them an
end of all strife. But God because He could swear by no greater, sware by Himself.” Well,
who then is He that sware unto Abraham? Is it not the Son ? No, one says. Certainly indeed
it was He: however, I shall not dispute <del>thereon</del>. So when He <del>the Son</del> sweareth the same
oath, “Verily, verily, I say unto you,” is it not plain that it was because He could not swear
by any greater? For as the Father sware, so also the Son sweareth by Himself, saying, “Verily,
verily, I say unto you.” He here reminds them also of the oaths of Christ, which He was
constantly uttering. “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, he that believeth on Me shall never die.”
( John xi. 26.)</p>
<p>What is, “And an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife”? it is instead of,
“by this every doubtful question is solved”: not this, or this, but every one.</p>
<p>God, however, ought to have been believed even without an oath: ( ver. 17 ) “wherein”
(he says) “God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability
of His counsel, confirmed it <del>lit. “mediated”2912</del> by an oath.” In these words he comprehends
also the believers, and therefore mentions this “promise” which was made to us in common
<del>with them</del>. “He mediated” (he says) “by an oath.” Here again he says that the Son was
mediator between men and God.</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible that God should
lie.” What are these two? The speaking and promising; and the adding an oath to the
promise. For since among men that which is <del>confirmed</del> by an oath is thought more worthy
of credit, on this account He added that also.</p>
<p>Seest thou that He regardeth not His own dignity, but how He may persuade men, and
endures to have unworthy things said concerning Himself. That is He wishes to impart full
assurance. And in the case of Abraham indeed <del>the Apostle</del> shows that the whole was of
God, not of his patient endurance, since He was even willing to add an oath, for He by whom
men swear, by Him also God “sware,” that is “by Himself.” They indeed as by one greater,
but He not as by one greater. And yet He did it. For it is not the same thing for man to swear
by himself, as for God. For man has no power over himself. Thou seest then that this is said
not more for Abraham than for ourselves: “that we” (he says) “might have strong consolation,
<note type="footnote">2912 ἐ μεσίτευσεν</note>

<pb n="784"/>
who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us.” Here too again,2913 “after
he had patiently endured he obtained the promise.”</p>
<p>“Now” he means, and he did not say “when2914 He swore.” But what the oath is, he
showed, by speaking of swearing by a greater. But since the race of men is hard of belief, He
condescends to the same <del>things</del> with ourselves. As then for our sake He swears, although
it be unworthy of Him that He should not be believed, so also did <del>the Apostle</del> make that
other statement: “He learned from the things which He suffered” ( c. v. 8 ), because men
think the going through experience more worthy of reliance.</p>
<p>What is “the hope set before us”? From these <del>past events</del> (he says) we conjecture the
future. For if these came to pass after so long a time, so certainly the others will. So that the
things which happened in regard to Abraham give us confidence also concerning the things
to come.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> ( Ver. 19, 20 ) “Which <del>hope</del> we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and
steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil: whither the forerunner is for us
entered, even Jesus, made High Priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.” He shows,
that while we are still in the world, and not yet departed from <del>this</del> life, we are already
among the promises. For through hope we are already in heaven. He said, “Wait; for it shall
surely be.” Afterwards giving them full assurance, he says, “nay rather by hope.”2915 And
he said not, “We are within,” but ‘It hath entered within,’ which was more true and more
persuasive. For as the anchor, dropped from the vessel, does not allow it to be carried about,
even if ten thousand winds agitate it, but being depended upon makes it steady, so also does
hope.</p>
<p>And see how very suitable an image he has discovered: For he said not, Foundation;
which was not suitable; but, “Anchor.” For that which is on the tossing sea, and seems not
to be very firmly fixed, stands on the water as upon land, and is shaken and yet is not shaken.
For in regard to those who are very firm, and philosophic, Christ with good reason made
that statement, saying, “Whosoever hath built his house on a rock.” ( Matt. vii. 24 .) But in
respect of those who are giving way, and who ought to be carried through by hope, Paul
hath suitably set down this. For the surge and the great storm toss the boat; but hope suffers
it not to be carried hither and thither, although winds innumerable agitate it: so that, unless
we had this [hope] we should long ago have been sunk. Nor is it only in things spiritual, but
<note type="footnote">2913 This observation seems to be suggested by the words “the hope set before us” : i.e. this is another instance
of obtaining a future blessing by patient waiting. The next clause bears on the Apostle’s statement that this oath
was made “that we might have consolation,” we, “now,” at this time; not Abraham, to whom the oath was originally
made.</note>
<note type="footnote">2914 ἐ πειδὴ, “at the very time that.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2915 Sav. and Ben. add ἤ δη ἐτύχετε, “ye have already attained it.”</note>

<pb n="785"/>
also in the affairs of this life, that one may find the power of hope great. Whatever it may
be, in merchandise, in husbandry, in a military expedition, unless one sets this before him,
he would not even touch the work. But he said not simply “Anchor,” but “sure and steadfast”
<del>i.e.</del> not shaken. “Which entereth into that within the veil”; instead of ‘which reacheth
through even to heaven.’</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Then after this he led on to Faith also, that there might not only be hope, but a very
true <del>hope</del>. For after the oath he lays down another thing too, even proof by facts, because
“the forerunner is for us entered in, even Jesus.” But a forerunner is a forerunner of some
one, as John was of Christ.</p>
<p>Now he did not simply say, “He is entered in,” but “where He is entered in a forerunner
for us,” as though we also ought to attain. For there is no great interval between the forerunner
and those who follow: otherwise he would not be a forerunner; for the forerunner and
those who follow ought to be in the same road, and to arrive after <del>each other</del>.</p>
<p>“Being made an High Priest forever after the order,” he says, “of Melchisedec.” Here is
also another consolation, if our High Priest is on high, and far better than those among the
Jews, not in the kind <del>of Priesthood</del> only, but also in the place, and the tabernacle, and the
covenant, and the person. And this also is spoken according to the flesh.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Those then, whose High Priest He is, ought to be greatly superior. And as great as
the difference is between Aaron and Christ, so great should it be between us and the Jews.
For see, we have our victim2916 on high, our priest on high, our sacrifice2917 on high: let
us bring such sacrifices as can be offered on that altar, no longer sheep and oxen, no longer
blood and fat. All these things have been done away; and there has been brought in their
stead “the reasonable service.” ( Rom. xii. 1.) But what is “the reasonable service”? The <del>offerings
made</del> through the soul; those made through the spirit. (“God,” it is said, “is a Spirit,
and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth”— John iv. 24 ); things
which have no need of a body, no need of instruments, nor of special places, whereof each
one is himself the Priest, such as, moderation, temperance, mercifulness, enduring illtreatment,
long-suffering, humbleness of mind.</p>
<p>These sacrifices one may see in the Old <del>Testament</del> also, shadowed out beforehand.
“Offer to God,” it is said, “a sacrifice of righteousness” ( Ps. iv. 5 ); “Offer a sacrifice of praise”
( Ps. l. 14 ); and, “a sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me” ( Ps. l. 23 ), and, “the sacrifice of God
is a broken spirit” ( Ps. li. 17 ); and “what doth the Lord require of thee but” to hearken to
Him? ( Mic. vi. 8.) “Burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou hast had no pleasure in: then
I said, Lo I come to do Thy will, O God!” ( Ps. xl. 6, 7 ), and again, “To what purpose do ye
<note type="footnote">2916 ἱ ερεῖον</note>

<pb n="786"/>
bring the incense from Sheba?” ( Jer. vi. 20.) “Take thou away from Me the noise of thy
songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.” ( Amos v. 23.) But instead of these “I will
have mercy and not sacrifice.” ( Hosea vi. 6.) Thou seest with what kind of “sacrifices God
is well pleased.” ( c. xiii. 16.) Thou seest also that already from the first the one class have
given place, and these have come in their stead.</p>
<p>These therefore let us bring, for the other indeed are <del>the offerings</del> of wealth and of
persons who have <del>possessions</del>, but these of virtue: those from without, these from within:
those any chance person even might perform; these only a few. And as much as a man is
superior to a sheep, so much is this sacrifice superior to that; for here thou offerest thy soul
as a victim.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> And other sacrifices also there are, which are indeed whole burnt-offerings, the
bodies of the martyrs: there both soul and body <del>are offered</del>. These have a great savor of a
sweet smell. Thou also art able, if thou wilt, to bring such a sacrifice.</p>
<p>For what, if thou dost not burn thy body in the fire? Yet in a different fire thou canst;
for instance, in that of voluntary poverty, in that of affliction. For to have it in one’s power
to spend one’s days in luxury and expense, and yet to take up a life of toil and bitterness,
and to mortify the body, is not this a whole burnt-offering? Mortify thy body, and crucify
it, and thou shalt thyself also receive the crown of this martyrdom. For what in the other
case the sword accomplishes, that in this case let a willing mind effect. Let not the love of
wealth burn, or possess you, but let this unreasonable appetite itself be consumed and
quenched by the fire of the Spirit; let it be cut in pieces by the sword of the Spirit.</p>
<p>This is an excellent sacrifice, needing no priest but him who brings it. This is an excellent
sacrifice, performed indeed below but forthwith taken up on high. Do we not wonder that
of old time fire came down and consumed all? It is possible now also that fire may come
down far more wonderful than that, and consume all the presented offerings:2918 nay rather,
not consume, but bear them up to heaven. For it does not reduce them to ashes, but offers
them as gifts to God.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Such were the offerings of Cornelius. For (it is said) “thy prayers and thine alms are
come up for a memorial before God.” ( Acts x. 4.) Thou seest a most excellent union. Then
are we heard, when we ourselves also hear the poor who come to us. “He” (it is said) “that
stoppeth his ears that he may not hear the poor” ( Prov. xxi. 13 ), his prayer God will not
hearken to. “Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord will deliver him in
the evil day.” ( Ps. xl. 1.) But what day is evil except that one which is evil to sinners?</p>
<p>What is meant by “he that considereth”? He that understandeth what it is to be a poor
man, that has thoroughly learned his affliction. For he that has learned his affliction, will
certainly and immediately have compassion on him. When thou seest a poor man, do not
<note type="footnote">2918 τὰ προκείμενα</note>

<pb n="787"/>
hurry by, but immediately reflect what thou wouldest have been, hadst thou been he. What
wouldest thou not have wished that all should do for thee? “He that considereth” (he says).
Reflect that he is a free-man like thyself, and shares the same noble birth with thee, and
possesses all things in common with thee; and yet oftentimes he is not on a level even with
thy dogs. On the contrary, while they are satiated, he oftentimes lies, sleeps, hungry, and
the free-man is become less honorable than thy slaves.</p>
<p>But they perform needful services for thee. What are these? Do they serve thee well?
Suppose then I show that this <del>poor man</del> too performs needful services for thee far greater
than they do. For he will stand by thee in the Day of judgment, and will deliver thee from
the fire. What do all thy slaves do like this? When Tabitha died, who raised her up? The
slaves who stood around or the poor? But thou art not even willing to put the free-man on
an equality with thy slaves. The frost is hard, and the poor man is cast out in rags, well-nigh
dead, with his teeth chattering, both by his looks and his air fitted to move thee: and thou
passeth by, warm and full of drink; and how dost thou expect that God should deliver thee
when in misfortune?</p>
<p>And oftentimes thou sayest this too: ‘If it had been myself, and I had found one that
had done many wrong things, I would have forgiven him; and does not God forgive?’ Say
not this. Him that has done thee no wrong, whom thou art able to deliver, him thou neglectest.
How shall He forgive thee, who art sinning against Him? Is not this deserving of hell?</p>
<p>And how amazing! Oftentimes thou adornest with vestments innumerable, of varied
colors and wrought with gold, a dead body, insensible, no longer perceiving the honor;
whilst that which is in pain, and lamenting, and tormented, and racked by hunger and frost,
thou neglectest; and givest more to vainglory, than to the fear of God.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> And would that it stopped here; but immediately accusations are brought against
the applicant. For why does he not work (you say)? And why is he to be maintained in
idleness? But (tell me) is it by working that thou hast what thou hast, didst thou not receive
it as an inheritance from thy fathers? And even if thou dost work, is this a reason why thou
shouldest reproach another? Hearest thou not what Paul saith? For after saying, “He that
worketh not, neither let him eat” ( 2 Thess. iii. 10 ), he says, “But ye be not weary in well
doing.” ( 2 Thess. iii. 13.)</p>
<p>But what say they? He is an impostor.2919 What sayest thou, O man? Callest thou him
an impostor, for the sake of a single loaf or of a garment? But (you say) he will sell it immediately.
And dost thou manage all thy affairs well? But what? Are all poor through idleness?
Is no one so from shipwreck? None from lawsuits? None from being robbed? None from
dangers? None from illness? None from any other difficulties? If however we hear any one
bewailing such evils, and crying out aloud, and looking up naked toward heaven, and with
<note type="footnote">2919 ἐ πιθέτης</note>

<pb n="788"/>
long hair, and clad in rags, at once we call him, The impostor! The deceiver! The swindler!
Art thou not ashamed? Whom dost thou call impostor? Give nothing, and do not accuse
the man.</p>
<p>But (you say) he has means, and pretends. This is a charge against thyself, not against
him. He knows that he has to deal with the cruel, with wild beasts rather than with men,
and that, even if he utter a pitiable story, he attracts no one’s attention: and on this account
he is forced to assume also a more miserable guise, that he may melt thy soul. If we see a
person coming to beg in a respectable dress, This is an impostor (you say), and he comes
in this way that he may be supposed to be of good birth. If we see one in the contrary guise,
him too we reproach. What then are they to do? O the cruelty, O the inhumanity!</p>
<p>And why (you say) do they expose their maimed limbs? Because of thee. If we were
compassionate, they would have no need of these artifices: if they persuaded us at the first
application, they would not have contrived these devices. Who is there so wretched, as to
be willing to cry out so much, as to be willing to behave in an unseemly way, as to be willing
to make public lamentations, with his wife destitute of clothing, with his children, to sprinkle
ashes on [himself]. How much worse than poverty are these things? Yet on account of them
not only are they not pitied, but are even accused by us.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Shall we then still be indignant, because when we pray to God, we are not heard?
Shall we then still be vexed, because when we entreat we do not persuade? Do we not tremble
for fear, my beloved?</p>
<p>But (you say) I have often given. But dost thou not always eat? And dost thou drive
away thy children often begging of thee? O the shamelessness! Dost thou call a poor man
shameless? And thou indeed art not shameless when plundering, but he is shameless when
begging for bread! Considerest thou not how great are the necessities of the belly? Dost not
thou do all things for this? Dost thou not for this neglect things spiritual? Is not heaven set
before thee and the kingdom of heaven? And thou fearing the tyranny of that <del>appetite</del>
endurest all things, and thinkest lightly of that <del>kingdom</del>. This is shamelessness.</p>
<p>Seest thou not old men maimed? But O what trifling! ‘Such an one’ (you say) ‘lends out
so many pieces of gold, and such an one so many, and yet begs.’ You repeat the stories and
trifles of children; for they too are always hearing such stories from their nurses. I am not
persuaded of it. I do not believe this. Far from it. Does a man lend money, and beg when
he has abundance? For what purpose, tell me? And what is more disgraceful than begging?
It were better to die than to beg. Where does our inhumanity stop? What then? Do all lend
money? Are all impostors? Is there no one really poor? “Yea” (you say) “and many.” Why
then dost thou not assist those persons, seeing thou art a strict enquirer into their lives? This
is an excuse and a pretense.</p>

<pb n="789"/>
<p>“Give to every one2920 that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
turn not thou away.” ( Matt. v. 42.) Stretch out thy hand, let it not be closed up. We have
not been constituted examiners into men’s lives, since so we should have compassion on
no one. When thou callest upon God why dost thou say, Remember not my sins? So then,
if that person even be a great sinner, make this allowance in his case also, and do not remember
his sins. It is the season of kindness, not of strict enquiry; of mercy, not of account. He
wishes to be maintained: if thou art willing, give; but if not willing, send him away without
raising doubts.2921 Why art thou wretched and miserable? Why dost thou not even thyself
pity him, and also turnest away those who would? For when such an one hears from thee,
This <del>fellow</del> is a cheat; that a hypocrite; and the other lends out money; he neither gives to
the one nor to the other; for he suspects all to be such. For you know that we easily suspect
evil, but good, not <del>so easily</del>.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> Let us “be merciful,” not simply so, but “as our heavenly Father is.” ( Luke vi. 36.)
He feeds even adulterers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and what shall I say? Those having
every kind of wickedness. For in so large a world there must needs be many such. But nevertheless
He feeds all; He clothes all. No one ever perished of hunger, unless one did so of
his own choice. So let us be merciful. If one be in want and in necessity, help him.</p>
<p>But now we are come to such a degree of unreasonableness, as to act thus not only in
regard to the poor who walk up and down the alleys, but even in the case of men that live
in <del>religious</del> solitude.2922 Such an one is an impostor, you say. Did I not say this at first,
that if we give to all indiscriminately, we shall always be compassionate; but if we begin to
make over-curious enquiries, we shall never be compassionate? What dost thou mean? Is
a man an impostor in order to get a loaf? If indeed he asks for talents of gold and silver, or
costly clothes, or slaves, or anything else of this sort, one might with good reason call him
a swindler. But if he ask none of these things, but only food and shelter, things which are
suited to a philosophic life,2923 tell me, is this the part of a swindler? Cease we from this
unseasonable fondness for meddling, which is Satanic, which is destructive.</p>
<p>For indeed, if a man say that he is on the list of the Clergy, or calls himself a priest, then
busy thyself <del>to enquire</del>, make much ado: since in that case the communicating2924 without
enquiry is not without danger. For the danger is about matters of importance, for thou dost
not give but receivest. But if he want food, make no enquiry.</p>

<p>Enquire, if thou wilt, how Abraham showed hospitality towards all who came to him.
If he had been over-curious about those who fled to him for refuge, he would not have
“entertained angels.” ( c. xiii. 2.) For perhaps not thinking them to be angels, he would have
thrust them too away with the rest. But since he used to receive all, he received even angels.</p>

<head>Homily XII.</head>
<p>Hebrews vii. 1–3</p>
<p>“For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the most High God, who met Abraham returning
from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him: to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
part of all; first being by interpretation King of Righteousness, and after that also King of
Salem, which is, King of Peace, without father, without mother, without genealogy, having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a
Priest continually.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Paul wishing to show the difference between the New and Old <del>Covenant</del>, scatters
it everywhere; and shoots from afar, and noises it abroad,2925 and prepares beforehand. For
at once even from the introduction, he laid down this saying, that “to them indeed He spake
by prophets, but to us by the Son” ( c. i. 1, 2 ), and to them “at sundry times and in divers
manners,” but to us through the Son. Afterwards, having discoursed concerning the Son,
who He was and what He had wrought, and given an exhortation to obey Him, lest we
should suffer the same things as the Jews; and having said that He is “High Priest after the
order of Melchisedec” ( c. vi. 20 ), and having oftentimes wished to enter into <del>the subject
of</del> this difference, and having used much preparatory management; and having rebuked
them as weak, and again soothed and restored them to confidence; then at last he introduces
the discussion on the difference <del>of the two dispensations</del> to ears in their full vigor. For he
who is depressed in spirits would not be a ready hearer. And that you may understand this,
hear the Scripture saying, “They hearkened not to Moses for anguish of spirit.”2926 ( Ex. vi.
9.) Therefore having first cleared away their despondency by many considerations, some
fearful, some more gentle, he then from this point enters upon the discussion of the difference
<del>of the dispensations</del>.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And what does he say? “For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the Most
High God.” And, what is especially noteworthy, he shows the difference to be great by the
Type itself. For as I said, he continually confirms the truth from the Type, from things past,
on account of the weakness of the hearers. “For” (he says) “this Melchisedec, King of Salem,
Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings,
and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all.” Having concisely set down
the whole narrative, he looked at2927 it mystically.</p>
<note type="footnote">2925 διακωδωνίζει</note>
<note type="footnote">2926 ὀ λιγοψυχίαν, “faint-heartedness.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2927 ἐ θεώρησε, “drew out the mystical senses.”</note>

<pb n="792"/>
<p>And first from the name. “First” (he says) “being by interpretation King of righteousness”:
for Sedec means “righteousness”; and Melchi, “King”: Melchisedec, “King of righteousness.”
Seest thou his exactness even in the names? But who is “King of righteousness,” save our
Lord Jesus Christ? “King of righteousness. And after that also King of Salem,” from his city,
“that is, King of Peace,” which again is <del>characteristic</del> of Christ. For He has made us righteous,
and has “made peace” for “things in Heaven and things on earth.” ( Col. i. 20.) What
man is “King of Righteousness and of Peace”? None, save only our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> He then adds another distinction, “Without father, without mother, without genealogy,
having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God,
abideth a Priest continually.” Since then there lay in his way <del>as an objection</del> the <del>words</del>
“Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec,” whereas he [Melchisedec] was
dead, and was not “Priest for ever,” see how he explained it mystically.</p>
<p>‘And who can say this concerning a man?’ I do not assert this in fact (he says); the
meaning is, we do not know when2928 <del>or</del> what father he had, nor what mother, nor when
he received his beginning, nor when he died. And what of this (one says)? For does it follow,
because we do not know it, that he did not die, <del>or</del> had no parents? Thou sayest well: he
both died and had parents. How then <del>was he</del> “without father, without mother”? How
“having neither beginning of days nor end of life”? How? <del>Why</del> from its not being expressed.
2929 And what of this? That as this man is so, from his genealogy not being given,
so is Christ from the very nature of the reality.</p>
<p>See the “without beginning”; see the “without end.” As in case of this man, we know
not either “beginning of days,” or “end of life,” because they have not been written; so we
know <del>them</del> not in the case of Jesus, not because they have not been written, but because
they do not exist. For that indeed is a type,2930 and therefore <del>we say</del> ‘because it is not
written,’ but this is the reality,2931 and therefore <del>we say</del> ‘because it does not exist.’ For as
in regard to the names also (for there “King of Righteousness” and “of Peace” are appellations,
but here the reality) so these too are appellations in that case, in this the reality. How then
hath He a beginning? Thou seest that the Son is “without beginning,”2932 not in respect of
His not having a cause;2933 (for this is impossible: for He has a Father, otherwise how is He
Son?) but in respect of His “not having beginning or end of life.”</p>

<p>“But made like unto the Son of God.” Where is the likeness? That we know not of the
one or of the other either the end or the beginning. Of the one because they are not written;
of the other, because they do not exist. Here is the likeness. But if the likeness were to exist
in all respects, there would no longer be type and reality; but both would be type. <del>Here</del>
then just as in representations2934 <del>by painting or drawing</del>, there is somewhat that is like
and somewhat that is unlike. By means of the lines indeed there is a likeness of features,2935
but when the colors are put on, then the difference is plainly shown, both the likeness and
the unlikeness.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 4. “Now consider” (saith he) “how great this man is to whom even the Patriarch
Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.”2936 Up to this point he has been applying the type:
henceforward he boldly shows him <del>Melchisedec</del> to be more glorious than the Jewish
realities. But if he who bears a type of Christ is so much better not merely than the priests,
but even than the forefather himself of the priests, what should one say of the reality? Thou
seest how super-abundantly he shows the superiority.</p>
<p>“Now consider” (he says) “how great this man is to whom even the Patriarch Abraham
gave a tenth out of the choice portions.” Spoils taken in battle are called “choice portions.”2937
And it cannot be said that he gave them to him as having a part in the war, because (he said)
he met him “returning from the slaughter of the kings,” for he had staid at home (he means),
yet <del>Abraham</del> gave him the first-fruits of his labors.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. “And verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of Priesthood,
have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their
brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.” So great (he would say) is the
superiority of the priesthood, that they who from their ancestors are of the same dignity,
and have the same forefather, are yet far better than the rest. At all events they “receive
tithes” from them. When then one is found, who receives tithes from these very persons,
are not they indeed in the rank of laymen, and he among the Priests?</p>
<p>And not only this; but neither was he of the same dignity with them, but of another
race: so that he would not have given tithes to a stranger unless his dignity had been great.
Astonishing! What has he accomplished? He has made quite clear a greater point than those
relating to faith which he treated in the Epistle to the Romans. For there indeed he declares
Abraham to be the forefather both of our polity and also of the Jewish. But here he is exceed-
<note type="footnote">2934 εἰκόσιν. The comparison is not between the living object and the picture, but between representations
in drawing and in painting; the word εἴκων, as our “likeness,” being applicable to both. The passage is considerably
altered in the common editions so as to avoid an apparent difficulty.</note>

ing bold against him, and shows that the uncircumcised person is far superior. How then
did he show that Levi paid tithes? Abraham (he says) paid them. ‘And how does this concern
us?’ It especially concerns you: for you will not contend that the Levites are superior to Abraham.
( Ver. 6 ) “But he whose descent is not counted from them, received tithes of Abraham.”</p>
<p>And after that he did not simply pass on, but added, “and blessed him that had the
promises.” Inasmuch as throughout, this was regarded with reverence, he shows that
<del>Melchisedec</del> was to be reverenced more than Abraham, from the common judgment of
all men. ( Ver. 7 ) “And without all contradiction,” he says, “the less is blessed of the better,”
i.e. in the opinion of all men it is the inferior that is blessed by the superior. So then the type
of Christ is superior even to “him that had the promises.”</p>
<p>( Ver. 8 ) “And here men that die receive tithes: but there he of whom it is testified that
he liveth.” But lest we should say, Tell us, why goest thou so far back? He says, ( ver. 9 )
“And as I may so say” (and he did well in softening it) “Levi also who receiveth tithes payed
tithes in Abraham.” How? ( Ver. 10 ) “For he was yet in his loins when Melchisedec met
him,” i.e. Levi was in him, although he was not yet born. And he said not the Levites but
Levi.</p>
<p>Hast thou seen the superiority? Hast thou seen how great is the interval between Abraham
and Melchisedec, who bears the type of our High Priest? And he shows that the superiority
had been caused by authority, not necessity. For the one paid the tithe, which indicates
the priest: the other gave the blessing, which indicates the superior. This superiority passes
on also to the descendants.</p>
<p>In a marvelous and triumphant way he cast out the Jewish <del>system</del>. On this account
he said, “Ye are become dull,” ( c. v. 12 ), because he wished to lay these foundations, that
they might not start away. Such is the wisdom of Paul, first preparing them well, he so
leads2938 them into what he wishes. For the human race is hard to persuade, and needs
much attention, even more than plants. Since in that case there is <del>only</del> the nature of material
bodies, and earth, which yields to the hands of the husbandmen: but in this there is
will, which is liable to many alterations, and now prefers this, now that. For it quickly turns
to evil.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Wherefore we ought always to “guard” ourselves, lest at any time we should fall
asleep. For “Lo” (it is said) “he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep” ( Ps. cxxi.
4 ), and “Do not suffer2939 thy foot to be moved.” ( Ps. cxxi. 3.) He did not say, ‘be not
<note type="footnote">2938 ἐ μβάλλει</note>
<note type="footnote">2939 In Psalm cxxi. 3 (cxx. 3, LXX.) where we have “He shall not suffer,” U+0026c., the LXX. have, μὴ δῴης εἰς
σάλον τὸν πόδα σον, μηδὲ νυστάξῃ (Vat.) ὁ φυλάσσων σε, “Lest thou suffer,” U+0026c., and “lest he that keepeth thee
slumber.” St. Chrys. substitutes δῷς for δῴης, making the sense, “Do not suffer,” U+0026c., “and let not him that
keepeth thee slumber.” This he applies to the Christian keeping guard over himself (his words are χρὴ πάντοτε</note>

<pb n="795"/>
moved’ but “do not thou suffer,” U+0026c. The suffering depends then on ourselves, and not on
any other. For if we will stand “steadfast and unmoveable” ( 1 Cor. xv. 58 ), we shall not be
shaken.</p>
<p>What then? Does nothing depend on God? All indeed depends on God, but not so that
our free-will is hindered. ‘If then it depend on God,’ (one says), ‘why does He blame us?’
On this account I said, ‘so that our free-will is not hindered.’ It depends then on us, and on
Him. For we must first choose the good; and then He leads us to His own.2940 He does not
anticipate our choice,2941 lest our free-will should be outraged. But when we have chosen,
then great is the assistance he brings to us.</p>
<p>How is it then that Paul says, “not of him that willeth,” if it depend on ourselves also
“nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.” ( Rom. ix. 16.)</p>
<p>In the first place, he did not introduce it as his own opinion, but inferred it from what
was before him and from what had been put forward2942 <del>in the discussion</del>. For after saying,
“It is written, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on
whom I will have compassion” ( Rom. ix. 15 ), he says, “It follows then2943 that it is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.” “Thou wilt say
then unto me, why doth He yet find fault?” ( Rom. ix. 16, 19.)</p>
<p>And secondly the other explanation may be given, that he speaks of all as His, whose
the greater part is. For it is ours to choose2944 and to wish; but God’s to complete and to
bring to an end. Since therefore the greater part is of Him, he says all is of Him, speaking
according to the custom of men. For so we ourselves also do. I mean for instance: we see a
house well built, and we say the whole is the Architect’s [doing], and yet certainly it is not
all his, but the workmen’s also, and the owner’s, who supplies the materials, and many
others’, but nevertheless since he contributed the greatest share, we call the whole his. So
then <del>it is</del> in this case also. Again, with respect to a number of people, where the many are,
<note type="footnote">φυλάττειν ἑαυτοὺς, μήποτε ἀπονυστάξωμεν): and so he seems to have understood ver. 4 , of the Christian:
that a watchman of Israel ought not to slumber or sleep. The Alex. ms. has νυστάξει in the third verse.</note>

<note type="footnote">2942 προκειμένου … προβληθέντος. The former word is used by St. Chrys. to express the portion of Scripture
on which he is treating: the latter is a received term in the dialectical method of the Greeks to express a
proposition put forward to be argued from, to see what consequences follow from it, with a view of showing
it to be untrue, or determining the sense in which it is true. St. Chrys. means to say that this proposition was
only thus argumentatively inferred by St. Paul.</note>

we say All are: where few, nobody. So also Paul says, “not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.”</p>
<p>And herein he establishes two great truths: one, that we should not be lifted up:2945
even shouldst thou run (he would say), even shouldst thou be very earnest, do not consider
that the well doing2946 is thine own. For if thou obtain not the impulse2947 that is from
above, all is to no purpose. Nevertheless that thou wilt attain that which thou earnestly
strivest after is very evident; so long as thou runnest, so long as thou willest.</p>
<p>He did not then assert this, that we run in vain, but that, if we think the whole to be our
own, if we do not assign the greater part to God, we run in vain. For neither hath God willed
that the whole should be His, lest He should appear to be crowning us without cause: nor
again our’s, lest we should fall away to pride. For if when we have the smaller [share], we
think much of ourselves, what should we do if the whole depended on us?</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Indeed God hath done away many things for the purpose of cutting away our
boastfulness, and still there is the2948 high hand. With how many afflictions hath He encompassed
us, so as to cut away our proud spirit! With how many wild beasts hath He encircled
us! For indeed when some say, ‘why is this?’ ‘Of what use is this?’ They utter these things
against the will of God. He hath placed thee in the midst of so great fear, and yet not even
so art thou lowly-minded; but if thou ever attain a little success, thou reachest to Heaven
itself in pride.</p>
<p>For this cause <del>come</del> rapid changes and reverses; and yet not even so are we instructed.
For this cause are there continual and untimely deaths, but are minded as if we were immortal,
as if we should never die. We plunder, we over-reach, as though we were never to give
account. We build as if we were to abide here always. And not even the word of God daily
sounded into our ears, nor the events themselves instruct us. Not a day, not an hour can be
mentioned, in which we may not see continual funerals. But all in vain: and nothing reaches
our hardness [of heart]: nor are we even able to become better by the calamities of others;
or rather, we are not willing. When we ourselves only are afflicted, then we are subdued,
and yet if God take off His hand, we again lift up our hand: no one considers what is proper
<note type="footnote">2945 In the genuine text here as in some other places, there is no mention of the second point. The longer
text has “one that we should not be lifted up by what we do well: the other that when we do well, we should attribute
to God the cause of our well-doing. Therefore,” U+0026c. Mr. Field thinks that either the thread of the
discourse is broken, and the second point not mentioned, or (which seems more probable) that it is contained
in the words “Nevertheless,” U+0026c. </note>

for man,2949 no one despises the things on earth; no one looks to Heaven. But as swine turn
their heads downwards, stooping towards their belly, wallowing in the mire; so too the great
body of mankind defile themselves with the most intolerable filth, without being conscious
of it.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> For better were it to be defiled with unclean mud than with sins; for he who is defiled
with the one, washes it off in a little time, and becomes like one who had never from the
first fallen into that slough; but he who has fallen into the deep pit of sin has contracted a
defilement that is not cleansed by water, but needs long time, and strict repentance, and
tears and lamentations, and more wailing, and that more fervent, than we show over the
dearest friends. For this defilement attaches to us from without, wherefore we also speedily
put it away; but the other is generated from within, wherefore also we wash it off with difficulty,
and cleanse ourselves from it. “For from the heart” (it is said) “proceed evil thoughts,
fornications, adulteries, thefts, false witnesses.” ( Matt. xv. 19.) Wherefore also the Prophet
said, “Create in me a clean heart, O God.” ( Ps. li. 10.) And another, “Wash thine heart from
wickedness, O Jerusalem.” ( Jer. iv. 14.) (Thou seest that it is both our <del>work</del> and God’s.)
And again, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” ( Matt. v. 8.)</p>
<p>Let us become clean to the utmost of our power. Let us wipe away our sins. And how
to wipe them away, the prophet teaches, saying, “Wash you, make you clean, put away your
wickedness from your souls, before Mine eyes.” ( Isa. i. 16.) What is “before Mine eyes”?
Because some seem to be free from wickedness, but only to men, while to God they are
manifest as being “whited sepulchers.” Therefore He says, so put them away as I see. “Learn
to do well, seek judgment, do justice for the poor and lowly.” “Come now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as scarlet, I will make you white as snow,
and if they be as crimson, I will make you white as wool.” ( Isa. i. 17, 18.) Thou seest that
we must first cleanse ourselves, and then God cleanses us. For having said first, “Wash you,
make you clean,” He then added “I will make you white.”</p>
<p>Let no one then, <del>even</del> of those who are come to the extremest wickedness, despair of
himself. For (He says) even if thou hast passed into the habit, yea and almost into the nature
of wickedness itself, be not afraid. Therefore taking <del>the instance of</del> colors that are not superficial
but almost of the substance of the materials, He said that He would bring them
into the opposite state. For He did not simply say that He would “wash” us, but that He
would “make” us “white, as snow and as wool,” in order to hold out good hopes before us.

wronged. These good deeds let us pursue after, and we shall be able also, by the grace of
God, to attain to the blessings to come: which may we all be counted worthy of, in Christ

<head>Homily XIII.</head>
<p>Hebrews vii. 11–14</p>
<p>“If therefore perfection were by2950 the Levitical priesthood; (for under it the people have received
the law’2951 ) what further need was there that another priest should arise after
the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood
being changed, there is2952 made of necessity a change also of the law. For He of whom
these things are spoken, pertained to another tribe, of2953 which no man gave attendance
at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake
nothing concerning priests.”2954</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “If therefore” (he says) “perfection were by the Levitical priesthood.” Having spoken
concerning Melchisedec, and shown how much superior he was to Abraham, and having
set forth the great difference between them, he begins from this point forward to prove the
wide difference as to the covenant itself, and how the one is imperfect and the other perfect.
However he does not even yet enter on the matters themselves, but first contends on the
ground of the priesthood, and the tabernacle. For these things would be more easily received
by the unbelieving, when the proof was derived from things already allowed, and believed.</p>
<p>He had shown that Melchisedec was greatly superior both to Levi and to Abraham, being
to them in the rank of the priests. Again he argues from a different point. What then is this?
Why (he says) did he not say, “after the order of Aaron”? And observe, I pray you, the great
superiority <del>of his argument</del>. For from the very circumstance which naturally excluded His
priesthood, viz. that He was not “after the order of Aaron,” from that he establishes Him,
and excludes the others. For this is the very thing that I say (he declares); why has He “not
been made after the order of Aaron”?</p>
<p>And the <del>saying</del> “what further need” has much emphasis. For if Christ had been “after
the order of Melchisedec” according to the flesh, and then afterwards the law had been introduced,
and all that pertained to Aaron, one might reasonably say that the latter as being
more perfect, annulled the former, seeing that it had come in after it. But if Christ comes

later, and takes a different type, as that of His priesthood, it is evident that it is because those
were imperfect. For (he would say) let us suppose for argument’s sake, that all has been
fulfilled, and that there is nothing imperfect in the priesthood. “What need” was there in
that case that He should be called “after the order of Melchisedec and not after the order of
Aaron”? Why did He set aside Aaron, and introduce a different priesthood, that of
Melchisedec? “If then perfection,” that is the perfection of the things themselves, of the
doctrines, of life, 2955 “had been by the Levitical priesthood.”</p>
<p>And observe how he goes forward on his path. He had said that <del>He was</del> “after the order
of Melchisedec,” implying that the [priesthood] “after the order of Melchisedec” is superior:
for <del>he was</del>2956 far superior. Afterwards he shows this from the time also, in that He was
after Aaron; evidently as being better.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And what is the meaning of what follows? “For” (he says) “under <del>or “upon”</del> it the
people have received the Law <del>or “have been legislated for”</del>.”2957 What is “under it” <del>U+0026c.</del>?
Ordereth itself2958 by it; through it does all things. You cannot say that it was given to others,
“the people under it have received the law,” that is, have used it, and did use it. You cannot
say indeed that it was perfect, it did not govern the people; “they have been legislated for
upon it,” that is, they used it.</p>
<p>What need was there then of another priesthood? “For the priesthood being changed,
there is of necessity a change of the law also.” But if there must be another priest, or rather
another priesthood, there must needs be also another law. This is for those who say, What
need was there of a new Covenant? For he could indeed have alleged a testimony from
prophecy also. “This is the covenant which I made with your fathers” <del>U+0026c.</del>. ( c. viii. 10.)
But for the present he contends on the ground of the priesthood. And observe, how he says
this from the first. He said, “According to the order of Melchisedec.” By this he excluded
the order of Aaron. For he would not have said “After the order of Melchisedec,” if the
other had been better. If therefore another priesthood has been brought in, there must be
also <del>another</del> Covenant; for neither is it possible that there should be a priest, without a
covenant and laws and ordinances, nor that having received a different priesthood He should
use the former <del>covenant</del>.</p>
<p>In the next place, as to the ground of objection: “How could He be a priest if He were
not a Levite?” Having overthrown this by what had been said above, he does not even think
it worth answering, but introduces it in passing. I said (he means) that the priesthood was

changed, therefore also the Covenant is. And it was changed not only in its character,2959
or in its ordinances, but also in its tribe. For of necessity <del>it must be changed</del> in its tribe
also. How? “For the priesthood being changed <del>or “transferred”</del>,” from tribe to tribe, from
the sacerdotal to the regal <del>tribe</del>, that the same might be both regal and sacerdotal.</p>
<p>And observe the mystery. First it was royal, and then it is become sacerdotal: so therefore
also in regard to Christ: for King indeed He always was, but has become Priest from the
time that He assumed the Flesh, that He offered the sacrifice. Thou seest the change, and
the very things which were ground of objection these he introduces, as though the natural
order of things required them. “For” (he says) “He of whom these things are spoken pertained
to another tribe.” I myself also say it, I know that this tribe <del>of Judah</del> had nothing of
priesthood. For there is a transferring.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Yea and I am showing another difference also (he would say): not only from the
tribe, nor yet only from the Person, nor from the character [of the Priesthood], nor from
the covenant, but also from the type itself. ( Ver. 16 ) “Who was made <del>“became” so</del>, not
according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless
life. He became” (he says) “a priest not according to the law of a carnal commandment”:
for that law was in many respects unlawful.2960</p>
<p>What is, “of a carnal commandment”? Circumcise the flesh, it says; anoint the flesh;
wash the flesh; purify the flesh; shave the flesh; bind upon the flesh;2961 cherish the flesh;
rest as to the flesh. And again its blessings, what are they? Long life for the flesh; milk and
honey for the flesh; peace for the flesh; luxury for the flesh. From this law Aaron received
the priesthood; Melchisedec however not so.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. “And it is yet far more evident, if after the similitude of Melchisedec there
ariseth another priest.” What is evident? The interval between the two priesthoods, the difference;
how much superior He is “who was made not according to the law of a carnal
commandment.” (Who? Melchisedec? Nay; but Christ.) “But according to the power of an
endless2962 life. For He testifieth, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec”;
that is, not for a time, nor having any limit, “but according to the power of an endless life,”
that is, by means of power, by means of “endless life.”</p>
<p>And yet this does not follow after, “who was made not according to the law of a carnal
commandment”: for what would follow would be to say, “but according to that of a spiritual
one.” However by “carnal,” he implied temporary. As he says also in another place, carnal
ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.” ( c. ix. 10.)</p>

<p>“According to the power of life,” that is, because He lives by His own power.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> He had said, that there is also a change of law, and up to this point he has shown it;
henceforward he enquires into the cause, that which above all gives full assurance to men’s
minds, <del>I mean</del> the knowing the cause thoroughly; and it leads us more to faith2963 when
we have learned also the cause, and the principle according to which <del>the thing</del> comes to
pass.</p>
<p>Ver. 18. “For there is verily” (he says) “a disannulling of the commandment going before,
for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.” Here the Heretics2964 press on. But listen
attentively. He did not say “for the evil,” nor, “for the viciousness,” but “for the weakness
and unprofitableness <del>thereof</del>,” yea and in other places also he shows the weakness; as when
he says “In that it was weak through the flesh.” ( Rom. viii. 3.) <del>The law</del> itself then is not
weak, but we.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “For the Law made nothing perfect.” What is, “make nothing perfect”? Made
no man perfect, being disobeyed. And besides, even if it had been listened to, it would not
have made one perfect and virtuous. But as yet he does not say this here, but that it had no
strength: and with good reason. For written precepts were there set down, Do this and Do
not that, being enjoined only, and not giving power within.2965 But “the Hope” is not such.</p>
<p>What is “a disannulling”? A casting out. A “disannulling” is a disannulling of things
which are of force. So that he implied, that it <del>once</del> was of force, but henceforward was of
no account, since it accomplished nothing. Was the Law then of no use? It was indeed of
use; and of great use: but to make men perfect it was of no use. For in this respect he says,
“The Law made nothing perfect.” All were figures, all shadows; circumcision, sacrifice,
sabbath. There fore they could not reach through the soul, wherefore they pass away and
gradually withdraw. “But the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw nigh unto
God.”</p>
<p><del>5.</del> ( Ver. 20 ) “And forasmuch as not without the taking of an oath.”2966 Thou seest
that the matter of the oath becomes necessary for him here. Accordingly for this reason he
previously treated much <del>hereon</del>, how that God swore; and swore for the sake of [<del>our</del>
fuller assurance.</p>
<p>“But the bringing in of a better hope.” For that system also had a hope, but not such as
this. For they hoped that, if they were well pleasing <del>to God</del>, they should possess the land,
that they should suffer nothing fearful. But in this <del>dispensation</del> we hope that, if we are
well pleasing [to God], we shall possess not earth, but heaven; or rather (which is far better

than this) we hope to stand near to God, to come unto the very throne of the Father, to
minister unto Him with the Angels. And see how he introduces these things by little and
little. For above he says “which entereth into that within the veil”, ( c. vi. 19 ), but here, “by
which we draw nigh unto God.”</p>
<p>“And inasmuch as not without an oath.” What is “And inasmuch as not without an
oath”? That is, Behold another difference also. And these things were not merely promised
(he says). “For those priests were made without an oath,” ( ver. 21, 22 ) “but This with an
oath, by Him that said unto Him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou art Priest for
ever after the order of Melchisedec.2967 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better
covenant.”2968 He lays down two points of difference, that it hath no end as the <del>covenant</del>
of the Law had;2969 and this he proves from <del>its being</del> Christ who exercises <del>the priesthood</del>;
for he says “according to the power of an endless life.” And he proves it also from the oath,
because “He swore,” U+0026c., and from the fact; for if the other was cast out, because it was weak,
this stands firm, because it is powerful. He proves it also from the priest. How? Because He
is One <del>only</del>; and there would not have been One <del>only</del>, unless He had been immortal.
For as there were many priests, because they were mortal, so <del>here is</del> The One, because He
is immortal. “By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant,” inasmuch as He
sware to Him that He should always be <del>Priest</del>; which He would not have done, if He were
not living.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> ( Ver. 25 ) “Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come unto
God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.” Thou seest that he says
this in respect of that which is according to the flesh. For when He <del>appears</del> as Priest, then
He also intercedes. Wherefore also when Paul says, “who also maketh intercession for us”
( Rom. viii. 34 ), he hints the same thing; the High Priest maketh intercession. For He “that
raiseth the dead as He will, and quickeneth them,” ( John v. 21 ), and that “even as the
Father” [doth], how <del>is it that</del> when there is need to save, He “maketh intercession”? ( John
v. 22.) He that hath “all judgment,” how <del>is it that</del> He “maketh intercession”? He that
“sendeth His angels” ( Matt. xiii. 41, 42 ), that they may “cast” some into “the furnace,” and
save others, how <del>is it that</del> He “maketh intercession”? Wherefore (he says) “He is able also
to save.” For this cause then He saves, because He dies not. Inasmuch as “He ever liveth,”
<note type="footnote">2967 [The words “after the order of Melchisedec” are in the text of St. Chrys. and in the Textus Rec. They are

He hath (he means) no successor: And if He have no successor, He is able to aid all men.
For there <del>under the Law</del> indeed, the High Priest although he were worthy of admiration
during the time in which he was <del>High Priest</del> (as Samuel for instance, and any other such),
but, after this, no longer; for they were dead. But here it is not so, but “He” saves “to the
uttermost.”2970</p>
<p>What is “to the uttermost”? He hints at some mystery. Not here2971 only (he says) but
there2972 also He saves them that “come unto God by Him.” How does He save? “In that
He ever liveth” (he says) “to make intercession for them.” Thou seest the humiliation? Thou
seest the manhood? For he says not, that He obtained this, by making intercession once for
all, but continually, and whensoever it may be needful to intercede for them.</p>
<p>“To the uttermost.” What is it? Not for a time only, but there also in the future life.
‘Does He then always need to pray? Yet how can <del>this</del> be reasonable? Even righteous men
have oftentimes accomplished all by one entreaty, and is He always praying? Why then is
He throned with <del>the Father</del>?’ Thou seest that it is a condescension. The meaning is: Be
not afraid, nor say, Yea, He loves us indeed, and He has confidence towards the Father, but
He cannot live always. For He doth live alway.</p>

<del>one from the other</del>, but leaving <del>you</del> to suppose2974 what is suitable.) Didst thou
mark the difference of the High Priest? He has summed up what was said before, “in all
points tempted like as we are yet without sin.” ( c. iv. 15.) “For” (he says) “such an High
Priest also became us, who is holy, harmless.” “Harmless”: what is it? Without wickedness:

may be well to give his words and also the two Greek texts corresponding to them, as an evidence that the text
which he had was of the short and simple form now restored in Mr. Field’s edition. “In interpretatione quoque
Epistolæ ad Hebræos, Sermone xiv, de eo quod scriptum est, Sicut consummatio per Leviticum sacerdotium erat,

quisquam de Deo dicat, et non erubescit dicens, quia Deus non est callidus, neque dolosus. De eo vero qui

is, <del>He is</del> not crafty. Could any one say this concerning God? And is one not ashamed to
say that God is not crafty, nor deceitful? Concerning Him, however, in respect of the Flesh,
it might be reasonable <del>to say it</del>. “Holy, undefiled.” This too would any one say concerning
God? For has He a nature capable of defilement? “Separate from sinners.”</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Does then this alone show the difference, or does the sacrifice itself also? How? (
Ver. 27 ) “He needeth not” (he says) “daily, as the High Priest,2976 to offer up sacrifices for
his sins, for this He did once for all, when He offered up Himself.” “This,” what? Here what
follows sounds a prelude concerning the exceeding greatness of the spiritual sacrifice and
the interval <del>between them</del>. He has mentioned the point of the priest; he has mentioned
that of the faith; he has mentioned that of the Covenant; not entirely indeed, still he has
mentioned it. In this place what follows is a prelude concerning the sacrifice itself. Do not
then, having heard that He is a priest, suppose that He is always executing the priest’s office.
For He executed it once, and thenceforward “sat down.” ( c. x. 12.) Lest thou suppose that
He is standing on high, and is a minister, he shows that the matter is <del>part</del> of a dispensation
<del>or economy</del>. For as He became a servant, so also <del>He became</del> a Priest and a Minister. But
as after becoming a servant, He did not continue a servant, so also, having become a Minister,
He did not continue a Minister. For it belongs not to a minister to sit, but to stand.</p>
<p>This then he hints at here, and also the greatness of the sacrifice, if being <del>but</del> one, and
having been offered up once only, it affected that which all <del>the rest</del> were unable to do. But
he does not yet <del>treat</del> of these points.</p>
<p>“For this He did,” he says. “This”; what? “For” (he says) “it is of necessity that this <del>Man</del>
have somewhat also to offer” ( c. viii. 3 ); not for Himself; for how did He offer Himself?
But for the people. What sayest thou? And is He able to do this? Yea (he says). “For the Law
maketh men high priests, which have infirmity.” ( c. vii. 28.) And doth He not need to offer
for Himself? No, he says. For, that you may not suppose that the <del>words, “this”</del> “He did
once for all,” are said respecting Himself also, hear what he says: “For the law maketh men
high priests, which have infirmity.” On this account they both offer continually, and for

or oftentimes for others?</p>
<p>“But the word of the oath which was since the Law <del>maketh</del> the Son who has been
consecrated for evermore.” “Consecrated”:2977 what is that? Paul does not set down the
common terms of contradistinction;2978 for after saying “having Infirmity,” he did not say
“the Son” who is mighty, but “consecrated”:2979 i.e. mighty, as one might say. Thou seest
that the name Son is used in contradistinction to that of servant. And by “infirmity” he
means either sin or death.</p>
<p>What is, “for evermore”? Not now only without sin but always. If then He is perfect, if
He never sins, if He lives always, why shall He offer many sacrifices for us? But for the
present he does not insist strongly on this point: but what he does strongly insist upon is,
His not offering on His own behalf.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Since then we have such an High Priest, let us imitate Him: let us walk in His footsteps.
There is no other sacrifice: one alone has cleansed us, and after this, fire and hell. For
indeed on this account he repeats it over and over, saying, “one Priest,” “one Sacrifice,” lest
any one supposing that there are many <del>sacrifices</del> should sin without fear. Let us then, as
many as have been counted worthy of The Seal, 2980 as many as have enjoyed The Sacrifice,
as many as have partaken of the immortal Table, continue to guard our noble birth and our
dignity for falling away is not without danger.</p>
<p>And as many as have not yet been counted worthy these <del>privileges</del>, let not these either
be confident on that account. For when a person goes on in sin, with the view of receiving
holy baptism at the last gasp, oftentimes he will not obtain it. And, believe me, it is not to
terrify you that I say what I am going to say. I have myself known many persons, to whom
this has happened, who in expectation indeed of the enlightening2981 sinned much, and on
the day of their death went away empty. For God gave us baptism for this cause, that He
might do away our sins, not that He might increase our sins. Whereas if any man have employed
it as a security for sinning more, it becomes a cause of negligence. For if there had
been no Washing, they would have lived more warily, as not having <del>the means of</del> forgive-

ness. Thou seest that we are the ones who cause it to be said “Let us do evil, that good may
come.” ( Rom. iii. 8.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, I exhort you also who are uninitiated, be sober. Let no man follow after
virtue as an hireling, no man as a senseless2982 person, no man as after a heavy and burdensome
thing. Let us pursue it then with a ready mind, and with joy. For if there were no reward
laid up, ought we not to be good? But however, at least with a reward, let us become good.
And how is this anything else than a disgrace and a very great condemnation? Unless thou
give me a reward (says one), I do not become self-controlled. Then am I bold to say something:
thou wilt never be self-controlled, no not even when thou livest with self-control, if
thou dost it for a reward. Thou esteemest not virtue at all, if thou dost not love it. But on
account of our great weakness, God was willing that for a time it should be practiced even
for reward, yet not even so do we pursue it.</p>
<p>But let us suppose, if you will, that a man dies, after having done innumerable evil things,
having also been counted worthy of baptism (which however I think does not readily happen),
tell me, how will he depart thither? Not indeed called to account for the deeds he had done,
but yet without confidence;2983 as is reasonable. For when after living a hundred years, he
has no good work to show,2984 but only that he has not sinned, or rather not even this, but
that he was saved by grace2985 only, and when he sees others crowned, in splendor, and
highly approved: even if he fall not into hell, tell me, will he endure his despondency?</p>
<p><del>10.</del> But to make the matter clear by an example, Suppose there are two soldiers, and
that one of them steals, injures, overreaches, and that the other does none of these things,
but acts the part of a brave man, does important things well, sets up trophies in war, stains
his right hand with blood; then when the time arrives, suppose that (from the same rank in
which the thief also was) he is at once conducted to the imperial throne and the purple; but
suppose that the other remains there where he was, and merely of the royal kindness does
not pay the penalty of his deeds, let him however be in the last place, and let him be stationed
under the King. Tell me, will he be able to endure his despair when he sees him who was
<del>ranked</del> with himself ascended even to the very highest dignities, and made thus glorious,
and master of the world, while he himself still remains below, and has not even been freed
from punishment with honor, but through the grace and kindness of the King? For even
should the King forgive him, and release him from the charges against him, still he will live
in shame; for surely not even will others admire him: since in such forgiveness, we admire

not those who receive the gifts, but those who bestow them. And as much as the gifts are
greater, so much the more are they ashamed who receive them, when their transgressions
are great.</p>
<p>With what eyes then will such an one be able to look on those who are in the King’s
courts, when they exhibit their sweatings out of number and their wounds, whilst he has
nothing to show, but has his salvation itself of the mere loving-kindness of God? For as if
one were to beg off a murderer, a thief, an adulterer, when he was going to be arrested, and
were to command him to stay at the porch of the King’s palace, he will not afterwards be
able to look any man in the face, although he has been set free from punishment: so too
surely is this man’s case.</p>
<p>For do not, I beseech you, suppose that because it is called a palace,2986 therefore all
attain the same things. For if here in Kings’ courts there is the Prefect, and all who are about
the King, and also those who are in very inferior stations, and occupy the place of what are
called Decani2987 (though the interval be so great between the Prefect and the Decanus)
much more shall this be so in the royal court above.</p>
<p>And this I say not of myself. For Paul layeth down another difference greater even than
these. For (he says) as many differences as there are between the sun and the moon and the
stars and the very smallest star, so many also between those in the kingdom <del>of Heaven</del>.
And that the difference between the sun and the smallest star is far greater than that between
the Decanus (as he is called) and the Prefect, is evident to all. For while the sun shines upon
all the world at once, and makes it bright, and hides the moon and the stars, the other often
does not appear, not even in the dark. For there are many of the stars which we do not see.
When then we see others become suns, and we have the rank of the very smallest stars,
which are not even visible, what comfort shall we have?</p>
<p>Let us not, I beseech you, let us not be so slothful, not so inert, let us not barter away
the salvation of God for an easy life, but let us make merchandise of it, and increase it. For
even if one be a Catechumen, still he knows Christ, still he understands the Faith, still he is
a hearer of the divine oracles, still he is not far from the knowledge; he knows the will of his
Lord. Wherefore does he procrastinate? wherefore does he delay and postpone? Nothing is
better than a good life whether here or there, whether in case of the Enlightened or of the
Catechumens,</p>

and be chaste. Is this difficult? How? when many, not Christians only but heathens also,
live chastely without a wife. That which the heathen surpasses2988 for vainglory, thou dost
not even keep for the fear of God.</p>
<p>Give (He says) to the poor out of what thou hast. Is this burdensome? But in this case
also heathen condemn us who for vainglory only have emptied out their whole possessions.</p>
<p>Use not filthy communication. Is this difficult? For if it had not been enjoined, ought
we not to have done right in this, to avoid appearing degraded? For that the contrary conduct
is troublesome, I mean the using filthy communication, is manifest from the fact that the
soul is ashamed and blushes if it have been led to say any such thing and would not unless
perhaps it were drunk. For when sitting in a public place, even if thou doest it at home, why
dost thou not do it there? Because of those that are present. Why dost thou not readily do
the same thing before thy wife? That thou mayest not insult her. So then thou dost it not,
lest thou shouldest insult thy wife; and dost thou not blush at insulting God? For He is
everywhere present, and heareth all things.</p>
<p>Be not drunken, He says. For this very thing of itself, is it not a chastisement? He did
not say, Put thy body on the rack, but what? Do not give it free rein2989 so as to take away
the authority of the mind: on the contrary “make not provision for the lusts thereof.” ( Rom.
xiii. 14.)</p>
<p>Do not (He says) seize by violence what is not thine own; do not overreach; do not forswear
thyself. What labors do these things require! what sweatings!</p>
<p>Speak evil of no man (He says) nor accuse falsely. The contrary indeed is a labor. For
when thou hast spoken ill of another, immediately thou art in danger, in suspicion, <del>saying</del>
Did he of whom I spake, hear? whether he be great or small. For should he be a great man,
immediately thou wilt be indeed in danger; but if small, he will requite thee with as much,
or rather with what is far more grievous; for he will say evil of thee in a greater degree. We
are enjoined nothing difficult, nothing burdensome, if we have the will. And if we have not
the will, even the easiest things will appear burdensome to us. What is easier than eating?
but from great effeminacy many feel disgust even at this, and I hear many say, that it is
weariness even to eat. None of these things is wearisome if thou hast but the will. For
everything depends on the will after the grace from above. Let us will good things that we
may attain also to the good things eternal, in Christ Jesus our Lord, whom to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews viii. 1, 2</p>
<p>“Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an High Priest; who
is set down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens: a minister of the
sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Paul mixes the lowly things with the lofty, ever imitating his Master, so that the
lowly become the path to the lofty, and through the former we are led to the latter, and when
we are amid the great things we learn that these <del>lowly ones</del> were a condescension. This
accordingly he does here also. After declaring that “He offered up Himself,” and showing
Him to be a “High Priest,” what does he say? “Now of the things which we have spoken this
is the sum: we have such an High Priest who is set down on the right hand of the throne of
the majesty.” And yet this is not <del>the office</del> of a Priest, but of Him whom the Priest should
serve.</p>
<p>“A minister of the sanctuary,” not simply a minister, but “a minister of the sanctuary.
And of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.” Thou seest the condescension.
Did he not a little before make a separation,2990 saying: “Are they not all ministering
spirits?” ( supra, i. 14 ) and therefore (he says) it is not said to them, “Sit thou on my right
hand,” ( supra, i. 13 ) for He that sitteth is not a minister. How is it then that it is here said,
“a minister,” and “a minister of the Sanctuary”? for he means here the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>See how he raised up the minds of the believing Jews. For as they would be apt to imagine
that we have no such tabernacle <del>as they had</del>, see here (he says) is the Priest, Great, yea,
much greater than the other, and who has offered a more wonderful sacrifice. But is not all
this mere talk? is it not a boast, and merely said to win over our minds? on this account he
established it first from the oath, and afterwards also from “the tabernacle.” For this difference
too was manifest: but the Apostle thinks of another also, “which” (he says) “the Lord pitched
<del>or “made firm”</del> and not man.” Where are they who say that the heaven whirls around?2991
where are they who declare that it is spherical? for both of these notions are overthrown
here.</p>
<p>“Now” (he says) “of the things which we have spoken this is the sum.” By “the sum” is
always meant what is most important. Again he brings down his discourse; having said what
is lofty, henceforward he speaks fearlessly.</p>

Chrysostom’s opinion, but it does not appear in this passage.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="811"/>
<p><del>2.</del> In the next place that thou mayest understand that he used the word “minister” of
the manhood, observe how he again indicates it: “For” ( ver. 3 ) (he says) “every high priest
is ordained to offer both gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
somewhat also to offer.”</p>
<p>Do not now, because thou hearest that He sitteth, suppose that His being called High
Priest is mere idle talk.2992 For the former, viz. His sitting, belongs to the dignity of the
Godhead,2993 but this to His great lovingkindness, and His tender care for us. On this account
he repeatedly urges2994 this very thing, and dwells more upon it: for he feared lest the other
<del>truth</del> should overthrow it.2995 Therefore he again brings down his discourse to this: since
some were enquiring why He died. He was a Priest. But there is no Priest without a sacrifice.
It is necessary then that He also should have a sacrifice.</p>
<p>And in another way; Having said that He is on high, he affirms and proves that He is a
Priest from every consideration, from Melchisedec, from the oath, from offering sacrifice.
From this he also frames another and necessary syllogism. “For if” (he says) “He had been
on earth, He would not be a Priest, seeing that there are priests who offer the gifts according
to the Law.” If then He is a Priest (as He really is), we must seek some other place for Him.
“For if He were” indeed “on earth, He should not be a priest.” For how <del>could He be</del>? He
offered no sacrifice, He ministered not in the Priest’s office. And with good reason, for there
were the priests. Moreover he shows, that it was impossible that <del>He</del> should be a priest
upon earth. For how <del>could He be</del>? There was no rising up against <del>the appointed Priests</del>,
he means.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Here we must apply our minds attentively, and consider the Apostolic wisdom; for
again he shows the difference of the Priesthood. “Who” (he says) “serve unto the example2996
and shadow of heavenly things.”</p>
<p>What are the heavenly things he speaks of here? The spiritual things. For although they
are done on earth, yet nevertheless they are worthy of the Heavens. For when our Lord Jesus
Christ lies slain2997 <del>as a sacrifice</del>, when the Spirit is with us,2998 when He who sitteth on
the right hand of the Father is here,2999 when sons are made by the Washing, when they
are fellow-citizens of those in Heaven, when we have a country, and a city, and citizenship

there, when we are strangers to things here, how can all these be other than “heavenly
things”? But what! Are not our Hymns heavenly? Do not we also who are below utter in
concert with them the same things which the divine choirs of bodiless powers sing above?
Is not the altar also heavenly? How? It hath nothing carnal, all spiritual things become the
offerings.3000 The sacrifice does not disperse into ashes, or into smoke, or into steamy savor,
it makes the things placed there bright and splendid. How again can the rites which we celebrate
be other than heavenly? For when He says, “Whose soever sins ye retain they are retained,
whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted” ( John xx. 23 ) when they have the
keys of heaven, how can all be other than heavenly?</p>
<p>“Who” (he says) “serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
admonished of God,3001 when he was about to make the tabernacle, for see, saith He, that
thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.” Inasmuch as
our hearing is less ready of apprehension than our sight (for the things which we hear we
do not in such wise lay up in our soul, as those which we see with our very eyes), He showed
him all. Either then he means this by “the example and shadow,” or else he <del>speaks</del> of the
Temple. For, he went on to say, “See” (His words are), that “thou make all things according
to the pattern3002 showed to thee in the mount.” Was it then only what concerned the furniture
of the temple that he saw, or was it also what related to the sacrifices, and all the rest?
Nay, one would not be wrong in saying even this; for The Church is heavenly, and is nothing
else than Heaven.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> ( Ver. 6 ) “But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry,3003 by how much
also He is the Mediator of a better covenant.” Thou seest (he means) how much better is
the one ministration than the other, if one be an example and type, and the other truth
<del>reality</del>. But this did not profit the hearers, nor cheer them. Therefore he says what especially
cheered them: “Which was established upon better promises.” Having raised them up by
speaking of the place, and the priest, and the sacrifice, he then sets forth also the wide difference
of the covenant, having also said before that it was “weak and unprofitable.” (See Heb.
vii. 18.)</p>
<p>And observe what safeguards he lays down, when intending to find fault with it. For in
the former place after saying, “according to the power of an endless life” ( Heb. vii. 16 ), he

then said that “there is a disannulling of the commandment going before” ( Heb. vii. 18 );
and then after that, he set forth something great, saying, “by which we draw nigh unto God.”
( Heb. vii. 19.) And in this place, after leading us up into Heaven, and showing that instead
of the temple, we have Heaven, and that those things were types of ours, and having by these
means exalted the Ministration <del>of the New Covenant</del>, he then proceeds suitably to exalt
the priesthood.</p>
<p>But (as I said) he sets down that which especially cheers them, in the words, “Which
was established upon better promises.” Whence does appear? In that this the one was cast
out, and the other introduced in its place: for it is therefore of force because it is better. For
as he says, “If perfection were by” it, “what further need was there, that another priest should
rise, after the order of Melchisedec?” ( Heb. vii. 11 ); so also here he used the same syllogism,
saying ( ver. 7 ) “For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been
sought for the second”; that is, if it made men “faultless.” For it is because he is speaking of
this that he did not say, “But finding fault with” it, but ( ver. 8, 9 ) “But finding fault with
them, He saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I
made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the
land of Egypt: because they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded them not, saith
the Lord.”</p>
<p>Yea, verily. And whence does it appear that <del>the first Covenant</del> came to an end? He
showed it indeed also from the Priest, but now he shows more clearly by express words that
it has been cast out.</p>
<p>But how is it “upon better promises”? For how, tell me, can earth and heaven be equal?
But do thou consider,3004 how he speaks of promises there <del>in that other covenant</del> also,
that thou mayest not bring this charge against it. For there also, he says “a better hope, by
which we draw nigh unto God” ( Heb. vii. 19 ), showing that a Hope was there also; and in
this place “better promises,” hinting that there also He had made promises.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as they were forever making objections, he says, “Behold! the days come,
saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house
of Judah.” He is not speaking of any old Covenant: for, that they might not assert this, he
determined the time also. Thus he did not say simply, “according to the covenant which I
made with their fathers,” lest thou shouldest say <del>it was</del> the one made with Abraham, or
that with Noah: but he declares what <del>covenant it was</del>, “not according to the covenant
which I made with their fathers” in the Exodus. Wherefore he added also, “in the day that
I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not
in My covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.” Thou seest that the evils begin

first from ourselves (“they” themselves first, saith he, “continued not in <del>the “covenant”</del>”)
and the negligence is from ourselves, but the good things from Him; I mean the <del>acts</del> of
bounty. He here introduces, as it were, an apology showing the cause why He forsakes them.</p>

Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put3005 My laws into their mind, and write them
in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people.” Thus He says
this concerning the New <del>covenant</del> because His words are “not according to the covenant
which I covenanted.”</p>
<p>But what other difference is there beside this?3006 Now if any person should say that
“the difference is not in this respect, but in respect to its being put into their hearts; He
makes no mention of any difference of ordinances, but points out the mode of its being
given: for no longer” (he says) “shall the covenant be in writings, but in hearts;” let the Jew
in that case show that this was ever carried into effect; but he could not, for it was made a
second time in writings after the return from Babylon. But I show that the Apostles received
nothing in writing, but received <del>it</del> in their hearts through the Holy Ghost. Wherefore also
Christ said, “When He cometh, He will bring all things to your remembrance, and He shall
teach you.” ( John xiv. 26.)</p>
<p><del>6.</del> ( Ver. 11, 12 ) “And they shall not teach” (he says) “every man his neighbor,3007
and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know Me from the least to
the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more.” Behold also another sign. “From the least even to the
greatest of them” (he says) “they shall know Me, and they shall not say, Know the Lord.”
When hath this been fulfilled save now? For our <del>religion</del>3008 is manifest: but theirs <del>i.e.
the Jews’</del> was not manifest, but had been shut up in a corner.</p>
<p><del>A covenant</del> is then said to be “new,” when it is different and shows some advantage
over the old. “Nay surely,” says one,3009 “it is new also when part of it has been taken away,
<note type="footnote">3005 “give.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3006 That is, besides the covenant being in itself a new one, different from the Mosaic, there is also, he says,
the difference in the mode of giving it, the one being written, the other put into the heart. The Jew is supposed

be given into the heart, and that this was fulfilled by the reformation of the people: as for instance after the
Captivity.</note>

and part not. For instance, when an old house is ready to fall down, if a person leaving the
whole, has patched up the foundation, straightway we say, he has made it new, when he has
taken some parts away, and brought others into their place. For even the heaven also is thus
called ‘new,’3010 when it is no longer ‘of brass,’ but gives rain;3011 and the earth likewise is
new when it is not un fruitful, not when it has been changed; and the house is likewise new,

of another system in place of the old, (i) as a repaired house is said to be new, and (ii) according to his
interpretation, as the Heavens are new, when after long drought they again give rain. St. Chrys. replies. i. That
after the Captivity the Covenant was still, as of old, unfruitful. ii. That this interpretation of the “new heaven”
is incorrect. iii. That the Prophecy distinctly foretells a substitution. The common editions have changed the
character of the passage by substituting ἄ λλως δὲ καινὴ for καινὴ two lines above, and καινὴ δὲ καὶ αὕτη τ.

<note type="footnote">3011 The Verona edition, one Catena, the mss. which Mr. Field usually follows, and the Latin versions of
Mutianus and the later translator, all give the text which is here translated: ὁ ταν μηκέτι χαλκοῦς ᾖ, ἀλλ̓ ὑετὸν
διδῷ· ὅταν μὴ ἄκαρπος, οὐχ ὁταν μεταβληθῇ, οὐχ ὅταν τὰ μὲν αὐτοῦ ἐξαιρεθῇ, τὰ δὲ μένῃ. Mr. Field says that
he has nolens volens admitted into the text the “amended” readings of the common editions, ὅ ταν μηκέτι χ. ᾖ.
ἀ. ὑ. διδῷ, καὶ ἡ γῆ ὁμοιως καινὴ, ὅταν μὴ ἀ. ᾖ, οὐχ ὅταν μεταβληθῆ, καὶ οἶκος οὕτω καινὸς ὅταν τὰ μὲν κ. λ.
“when it is no longer of brass, but gives rain: [and the earth in like manner is new,] when it is not unfruitful, not
when it has been changed: [and in this sense the house is new], when portions of it have been,” U+0026c. There does
not however appear to be any need for this: on the contrary, while the old text is simple and intelligible, the
additions bring in matters which are out of place. [The other Catena, however, that of Niketas, Archbishop
of Heraklea, one of Mr. Field’s valuable authorities, has the bracketed bits.] The words ὅ ταν μὴ ἄκαρπος apply
naturally to the heaven, when it does not supply the moisture necessary for producing fruit. This argument from
the “new heaven” is alleged by the objector as distinct from that of the “new house” : it is an instance, he would
say, of the word “new” being applied, when there was neither change nor substitution, as St. Chrys. interprets
the prophecy: nor even partial alteration as in the analogy of the “new house” ; but only a renewal of fertilizing
action which had been previously suspended. On the other hand the introduction of “the new earth” by the interpolator
is out of place: inasmuch as unfruitful ground would represent the people not the Law; neither does
St. Chrys. in the refutation which follows refer at all to this point of “new earth.” The introduction of the “house”
is simply needless repetition. [It has seemed better to follow in the translation Field’s text than to follow the
alterations of the English edition—both because the passage is thus much clearer, and because this is professedly
a translation of Field’s text, and his critical sagacity must be considered on such a point of higher value.—F.G.]</note>

<p>If then I show that that covenant had become “Old” in this respect, that it yielded no
fruit? And that thou mayest know this exactly, read what Haggai says, what Zechariah, what
the Messenger,3013 when the return from the Captivity had not yet fully taken place; and
what Esdras charges. How then did <del>the people</del> receive him?3014 And how no man enquired
of the Lord, inasmuch as they <del>the priests</del> themselves also transgressed, and knew it not
even themselves?3015 Dost thou see how thy <del>interpretation</del> is broken down,3016 whilst I
maintain my own: that this <del>covenant</del> must be called “New” in the proper sense of the
word?</p>
<p>And besides, I do not concede that the words “the heaven shall be new” ( Isa. lxv. 17 ),
were spoken concerning this. For why, when saying in Deuteronomy “the heaven shall be
of brass,” did he not set down this in the contrasted passage,3017 “but if ye hearken, it shall
be new.”</p>
<p>And further on this account He says that He will give “another Covenant, because they
did not continue in the first.” This I show by what he says (“For what the law could not do
in that it was weak through the flesh,” Rom. viii. 3 ; and again, “Why tempt ye God, to put
a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”
Acts xv. 10.) But “they did not continue therein,” he says.
Here he shows that <del>God</del> counts us worthy of greater and of spiritual <del>privileges</del>: for
it is said “their sound went out into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world.”
( Ps. xix. 5; Rom. x. 18.) That is <del>the meaning of</del> “they shall not say each man to his neighbor,
Know the Lord.” And again, “the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as
much water to cover the seas.” ( Isa. xi. 9 .)</p>
<p><del>7.</del> “In calling it new” (he says), “He hath made the first old: but that which decayeth
and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.” See what was hidden, how he hath laid open the
very mind of the prophet! He honored the law, and was not willing to call it “old” in express
terms: but nevertheless, this he did call it. For if the former had been new, he would not
have called this which came afterwards “new” also. So that by granting something more and

“Quomodo corripuerunt eum?” Mr. Field thinks that neither reading gives a suitable meaning. If the reading
adopted by Mr. F. and followed in the translation be the true one, it must be supposed that St. Chrys. had in
mind the condition in which Ezra, or perhaps Nehemiah, found the Jews. The words τί δὲ ῎Εσδρας ἐγκαλεῖ ;
seem more appropriate to Nehemiah than to Ezra: and the reception of Nehemiah on his second visit to Jerusalem
may have been the circumstance of which the orator was thinking.</note>

different, he declares that “it was waxen old.” Therefore it is done away and is perishing,
and no longer exists.</p>
<p>Having taken boldness from the prophet, he attacks it more suitably,3018 showing that
our <del>dispensation</del> is now flourishing. That is, he showed that <del>the other</del> was old: then
taking up the word “old,” and adding of himself another <del>circumstance</del>, the <del>characteristic</del>
of old age, he took up what was omitted by the others, and says “ready to vanish away.”</p>
<p>The New then has not simply caused the old to cease, but because it had become aged,
as it was not <del>any longer</del> useful. On this account he said, “for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof” ( Heb. vii. 18 ), and, “the law made nothing perfect” ( Heb. vii. 19 ); and
that “if the first had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.”
( Heb. viii. 7.) And “faultless”; that is, useful; not as though it <del>the old Covenant</del> was obnoxious
to any charges, but as not being sufficient. He used a familiar form of speech. As if one
should say, the house is not faultless, that is, it has some defect, it is decayed: the garment
is not faultless, that is, it is coming to pieces. He does not therefore here speak of it as evil,
but only as having some fault and deficiency.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> So then we also are new, or rather we were made new, but now are become old;
therefore we are “near to vanishing away,” and to destruction. Let us scrape off3019 this old
age. It is indeed no longer possible to do it by Washing, but by repentance it is possible here
<del>in this life</del>.3020 If there be in us anything old, let us cast it off; if any “wrinkle,” if any stain,
if any “spot,” let us wash it away and become fair ( Eph. v. 27 ): that “the King may desire
our beauty.” ( Ps. xlv. 11.)</p>
<p>It is possible even for him who has fallen into the extremest deformity3021 to recover
that beauty of which David says that the King shall desire thy beauty. “Hearken, O daughter,
and consider; forget also thine own people and thy father’s house: so shall the King greatly
desire thy beauty.” ( Ps. xlv. 10, 11.) And yet forgetting doth not produce beauty. Yea, beauty
is of the soul. What sort of forgetting? That of sins. For he is speaking about the Church

<del>of</del> those that sacrificed to idols; for from such was it gathered.</p>
<p>And he said not, “Go not after them,” but what is more, Do not admit them into thy
mind; which he says also in another place, “I will not mention their names through my lips.”
( Ps. xvi. 4.) And again, “That my mouth may not talk of the deeds of men.” ( Ps. xvii. 3, 4.)
As yet is this no great virtue; nay, rather, it is indeed great, but not such as this <del>which is
here spoken of</del>. For what does he say there? He says not; “Talk not of the things of men,
neither speak of the things of thy fathers”; but, neither remember them, nor admit them
into thy mind. Thou seest to how great a distance he would have us keep away from
wickedness. For he that remembers not <del>a matter</del> will not think of it, and he that does not
think, will not speak of it: and he that does not speak of it, will not do it. Seest thou from
how many paths he hath walled us off? by what great intervals he hath removed us, even to
a very great <del>distance</del>?</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Let us then also “hearken and forget” our own evils. I do not say our sins, for (He
says) “Remember thou first, and I will not remember.” ( Isa. xliii. 26, 25 , LXX.) I mean for
instance, Let us no longer remember rapacity, but even restore the former <del>plunder</del>. This
is to forget wickedness, and to cast out the thought of rapacity, and never at any time to
admit it, but to wipe away also the things already done amiss.</p>
<p>Whence may the forgetfulness of wickedness come to us? From the remembrance of
good things, from the remembrance of God. If we continually remember God, we cannot
remember those things also. For (he says) “When I remembered Thee upon my bed, I
thought upon Thee in the morning dawn.” ( Ps. lxiii. 6.) We ought then to have God always
in remembrance, but then especially, when thought is undisturbed, when by means of that
remembrance <del>a man</del> is able to condemn himself, when he can retain <del>things</del> in memory.
For in the daytime indeed, if we do remember, other cares and troubles entering in, drive
the thought out again: but in the night it is possible to remember continually, when the soul
is calm and at rest; when it is in the haven, and under a serene sky. “The things which you
say in your hearts be ye grieved for on your beds,” he says. ( Ps. iv. 4 , LXX.) For it were indeed
right to retain this remembrance through the day also. But inasmuch as you are always full
of cares, and distracted amidst the things of this life, at least then remember God on your
bed; at the morning dawn meditate upon Him.</p>
<p>If at the morning dawn we meditate on these things, we shall go forth to our business
with much security. If we have first made God propitious by prayer3022 and supplication,
going forth thus we shall have no enemy. Or if thou shouldest, thou wilt laugh him to scorn,
having God propitious. There is war in the market place; the affairs of every day are a fight,
they are a tempest and a storm. We therefore need arms: and prayer is a great weapon. We
<note type="footnote">3022 ἐ ντεύξει</note>

<pb n="819"/>
need favorable winds; we need to learn everything, so as to go through the length of the day
without shipwrecks and without wounds. For every single day the rocks are many, and oftentimes
the boat strikes and is sunk. Therefore have we especially need of prayer early and
by night.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> Many of you have often beheld the Olympic games: and not only have beheld but
have been zealous partisans and admirers of the combatants, one of this <del>combatant</del>, one
of that. You know then that both during the days of the contests, and during those nights,
all night long the herald3023 thinks of nothing else, has no other anxiety, than that the
combatant should not disgrace himself when he goes forth. For those who sit by the trumpeter
admonish him not to speak to any one, that he may not spend his breath and get laughed
at. If therefore he who is about to strive before men, uses such forethought, much more will
it befit us to be continually thoughtful, and careful, since our whole life is a contest. Let
every night then be a vigil, 3024 and let us be careful that when we go out in the day we do
not make ourselves ridiculous. And would it were only making ourselves ridiculous. But
now the Judge of the contest is seated on the right hand of the Father, hearkening diligently
that we utter not any false note, anything out of tune. For He is not the Judge of actions
only, but of words also. Let us keep our vigil,3025 beloved; we also have those that are eager
for our success, if we will. Near each one of us Angels are sitting; and yet we snore through
the whole night. And would it were only this. But many do even many licentious things,
some indeed going to the very brothels,3026 and others making their own houses places of
whoredom by taking courtesans thither. Yes most certainly. For is it not so? They care well
for their contest. Others are drunken and speak amiss;3027 others make an uproar. Others
keep evil vigil through the night weaving, and worse than those who sleep, schemes of deceit;
others by calculating usury; others by bruising themselves with cares, and doing anything
rather than what is suited to the contest. Wherefore, I exhort you, let us lay aside all <del>other</del>
things, and look to one only, how we may obtain the prize, <del>how we may</del> be crowned with
the Chaplet; let us do all by which we shall be able to attain to the promised blessings. Which
may we all attain in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father and also to the Holy
Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews ix. 1–5</p>
<p>“Then verily the first <del>covenant</del> had also ordinances of divine service, and a3028 worldly
Sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the Candlestick, and
the Table, and the Shew-bread, which is called the Sanctuary. And after the second veil,
the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer and the Ark
of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold: wherein was the golden pot that had3029
manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant: and over it the
Cherubim of glory, shadowing the Mercy-seat: of which we cannot now speak particularly.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> He has shown from the Priest, from the Priesthood, from the Covenant, that that
<del>dispensation</del> was to have an end. From this point he shows it from the fashion of the tabernacle
itself. How? This, he says, <del>was</del> the “Holy”3030 and the “Holy of Holies.”3031 The
holy place then is a symbol of the former period (for there all things are done by means of
sacrifices); but the Holy of Holies of this that is now present.
And by the Holy of Holies he means Heaven; and by the veil, Heaven, and the Flesh3032
“entereth3033 into that within the veil”: that is to say, “through the veil of His flesh.” (Supra,
vi. 19; Heb. x. 20.)</p>
<p>And it were well to speak of this passage, taking it up from the beginning. What then
does he say? “Then verily the first had also” (the first what? “The Covenant”). “Ordinances
of Divine service.” What are “ordinances”? symbols or rights. Then;3034 as (he means) it

<note type="footnote">3033 This passage is translated [in the English edition] as if there was a point between τὴν σάρκα and
εἰσερχομένην : and as if in the next clause τουτέστι was a part of the citation, being put by St. Chrys. before
the words διὰ τοῦ καταπετάσματος, instead of after them, as in Heb. x. 20. St. Chrys. says that “the veil” represents
both Heaven and “the Flesh” of our Lord; and cites the two places where it is so interpreted by the Apostle, vi.
19, x. 20. See below [4], p. 440. [The simple translation of the Greek (as given in the text) seems far better than
this curious modification. The clause τὴν σάρκα εἰσερχομένην εἰς τὸ ἐσώτ. τ. καταπετ. is closely connected
together, and it is hardly tolerable to separate σάρκα from the participle agreeing with it. There is no “which”

<note type="footnote">3034 τότε. Mr. Field seems to think that the Expositor read τότε in the sacred text: though, as he observes,

has not now. He shows that it had already given place, for (he says) it had at that time; so
that now, although it stood, it is not.</p>
<p>“And the worldly Sanctuary.” He calls it “worldly,” inasmuch as it was permitted to all
to tread it, and in the same house the place was manifest where the priests stood, where the
Jews, the Proselytes, the Grecians, the Nazarites. Since, therefore even Gentiles were permitted
to tread it, he calls it “worldly.” For surely the Jews were not “the world.”</p>
<p>“For” (he says) “there was a tabernacle made; the first, which is called holy, wherein was
the Candlestick, and the Table, and the Shew-bread.” These things are symbols of the world.</p>
<p>“And after the second veil” (There was then not one veil <del>only</del>, but there was a veil
without also) “the tabernacle, which is called holy of holies.” Observe how everywhere he
calls it a tabernacle in regard of <del>God’s</del> encamping there.3035</p>
<p>“Which had” (he says) “a golden Censer, and the ark of the Covenant overlaid round
about with gold: wherein was the golden pot that held the manna, and Aaron’s rod that
budded, and the tables of the covenant.” All these things were venerable and conspicuous
memorials of the Jewish obstinacy; “and the tables of the covenant” (for they brake them)
“And the manna” (for they murmured; and therefore handing on the memory thereof to
posterity, He commanded it to be laid up in a golden pot). “And Aaron’s rod that budded.
And over it, the Cherubim of glory.” What is “the Cherubim of glory”? He either means
“the glorious,” or those which are under God.3036 “Shadowing the mercy-seat.”</p>
<p>But in another point of view also he extols these things in his discourse, in order to show
that those which come after them are greater. “Of which” (he says) “we cannot now speak
particularly.” In these words he hints that these were not merely what was seen, but were a
sort of enigmas.3037 “Of which” (he says) “we cannot now speak particularly,” perhaps because
they needed a long discourse.</p>

theirs than <del>ours</del> for whom they prophesied.3038</p>

without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people.”3040 Thou
seest that the types were already laid down beforehand? for, lest they should say, “how is
there <del>but</del> one sacrifice?” he shows that this was so from the beginning, since at least the
more holy and the awful <del>sacrifice</del> was <del>but</del> one. And how did the High Priest offer once

for the business was not so great.) He signifies that there shall be a sacrifice, not consumed
by fire, but rather distinguished by blood. For inasmuch as he called the Cross a sacrifice,
though it had neither fire, nor logs, nor was offered many times, but had been offered in
blood once for all; he shows that the ancient sacrifice also was of this kind, was offered “once
for all” in blood.</p>
<p>“Which he offers for himself;” again, “for himself; and for the errors of the people.” He
said not “sins”; but “errors,” that they might not be high-minded. For even if thou hast not
sinned intentionally, yet unintentionally thou hast erred,3041 and from this no man is pure.</p>
<p>And everywhere <del>he adds</del> the “for himself,” showing that Christ is much greater. For
if He be separated from our sins, how did He “offer for Himself”? Why then saidst thou
these things (one says)? Because this is <del>a mark</del> of One that is superior.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Thus far there is no speculation.3042 But from this point he philosophizes3043 and
says, ( ver. 8 ) “The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the Holiest of all was not
yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing.” For this cause (he says)
have these things been thus “ordained,” that we might learn that “the Holy of Holies,” that
is, Heaven, is as yet inaccessible. Let us not then think (he says) that because we do not enter
them, they have no existence: inasmuch as neither did we enter the Most Holy <del>place</del>.</p>

coming of Christ, it is no longer a time present: For how <del>could it be</del>, having arrived, and
being ended?</p>
<p>There is too something else which he indicates, when he says this, “which <del>was</del> a figure
for the time then present,” that is, became the Type. “In which3046 were offered both gifts
and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the
conscience.” Thou seest now what is <del>the meaning of</del> “The Law made nothing perfect,” (
Heb. vii. 19 ,) and “If that first <del>covenant</del> had been faultless.” ( Heb. viii. 7.) How? “As
pertaining to the conscience.” For the sacrifices did not put away3047 the defilement from
the soul, but still were concerned with the body: “after the law of a carnal commandment.”
( Heb. vii. 16.) For certainly they could not put away3048 adultery, nor murder, nor sacrilege.
Seest thou? Thou hast eaten this, Thou hast not eaten that, which are matters of indifference.
<del>“Which stood</del> only in meats and drinks, and divers washings.” “Thou hast drunk this,”
he says: and yet nothing has been ordained concerning drink, but he said this, treating them
as trifles.3049</p>
<p>Ver. 10. “And <del>in</del> divers washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the
time of reformation.”3050 For this is the righteousness of the flesh. Here he depreciates the
sacrifices, showing that they had no efficacy, and that they existed “till the time of reformation,”
that is, they waited for the time that reformeth all things.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 11. “But Christ being come an High Priest of good things that are come3051
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands.” Here he means the flesh.
And well did he say, “greater and more perfect,” since God The Word and all the power of
The Spirit dwells therein; “For God giveth not the Spirit by measure <del>unto Him</del>.” ( John
iii. 34.) And “more perfect,” as being both unblamable, and setting right greater things.</p>
<p>“That is, not of this creation.” See how <del>it was</del> “greater.” For it would not have been
“of the Spirit” ( Matt. i. 20 ), if man had constructed it. Nor yet is it “of this creation”; that
is, not of these created things, but spiritual, of3052 the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Seest thou how he calls the body tabernacle and veil and heaven.3053 “By a greater and
more perfect tabernacle. Through the veil, that is, His flesh.” ( Heb. x. 20.) And again, “into
that within the veil.” ( Heb. vi. 19.) And again, “entering into3054 the Holy of Holies, to appear
before the face of God.” ( Heb. ix. 24.) Why then doth he this? According as one thing or a
different one is signified. I mean for instance, the Heaven is a veil, for as a veil it walls off
the Holy of Holies; the flesh [is a veil] hiding the Godhead;3055 and the tabernacle likewise
holding the Godhead. Again, Heaven <del>is</del> a tabernacle: for the Priest is there within.</p>
<p>“But Christ” (he says) “being come an High Priest”: he did not say, “become,” but “being
come,” that is, having come for this very purpose, not having been successor to another. He
did not come first and then become <del>High Priest</del>, but came and became at the same time.3056
And he did not say “being come an High Priest” of things which are sacrificed, but “of good
things that are come,” as if his discourse had not power to put the whole before us.</p>
<p>Ver. 12. “Neither by the blood,” he says, “of goats and calves” (All things are changed)
“but by His own Blood” (he says) “He entered in once for all3057 into the Holy Place.” See
thus he called Heaven. “Once for all” (he says) “He entered into the Holy Place, having obtained
eternal redemption.” And this <del>expression</del> “having obtained,” was <del>expressive</del> of
things very difficult, and that are beyond expectation, how by one entering in, He “obtained
everlasting redemption.”</p>

<note type="footnote">3053 A slight alteration of Mr. Field’s text seems needed here. The text of the Homily which he gives in
accordance with all the authorities is: ὁ ρᾷς πῶς καὶ σκηνὴν καὶ καταπέτασμα καὶ οὐρανὸν τὸ σῶμα καλεῖ.
But there is no appearance that the Apostle called Christ’s body heaven, nor do any of the texts cited show
it. If however, we introduce καὶ before τὸ σῶμα, or substitute it for τὸ, we have a good sense, in accordance
with the four texts cited by St Chrys. and the explanations which he afterwards gives. [The criticism of the
English editor is not without some force; yet it seems best to adhere to the text of St. Chrys., as is here done.
The proposed alteration does not remove the difficulty, which is merely negative. The rendering in the English
edition is “he calls heaven and the body both tabernacle and veil.” But τὸ σῶμα should be the subject and σκηνὴν
καὶ καταπέτασμα καὶ οὐρανόν predicates.—F.G.]</note>

made as if the pointing was τὰ ἅγια· καταπέτασμα ἡ σὰρξ, κρύπτουσα τὴν θ. Otherwise we must supply ἡ σὰρξ

<p>Ver. 13, 14. “For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the Blood of
Christ, who through the Holy3058 Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your
conscience from dead works, to serve the living God.”</p>
<p>For (he says) if “the blood of bulls” is able to purify the flesh, much rather shall the
Blood of Christ wipe away the defilement of the soul. For that thou mayest not suppose
when thou hearest <del>the word</del>“sanctifieth,” that it is some great thing, he marks out3059
and shows the difference between each of these purifyings, and how the one of them is high
and the other low. And says it is <del>so</del> with good reason, since that is “the blood of bulls,”
and this “the Blood of Christ.”</p>
<p>Nor was he content with the name, but he sets forth also the manner of the offering.
“Who” (he says) “through the Holy3060 Spirit offered Himself without spot to God,” that
is, the victim was without blemish, pure from sins. For this is <del>the meaning of</del> “through
the Holy Spirit,” not through fire, nor through any other things.</p>
<p>“Shall purge your conscience” (he says) “from dead works.” And well said he “from
dead works”; if any man touched a dead body, he was polluted; and here, if any man touch
a “dead work,” he is defiled through his conscience. “To serve” (he says) “the Living and
true God.” Here he declares that it is not <del>possible</del> while one has “dead works to serve the
Living and true God,” for they are both dead and false; and with good reason <del>he says this</del>.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Let no man then enter in here with “dead works.” For if it was not fit that one should
enter in who had touched a dead body, much more one that hath “dead works”: for this is
the most grievous pollution. And “dead works” are, all which have not life, which breathe
forth an ill odor. For as a dead body is useful to none of the senses, but is even annoying to
those who come near it, so sin also at once strikes the reasoning faculty,3061 and does not
allow the understanding itself to be calm, but disturbs and troubles it.</p>
<p>And it is said too that a plague at its very commencement corrupts3062 the living bodies;
such also is sin. It differs in nothing from a plague, not <del>indeed</del> corrupting the air first, and
then the bodies, but darting at once into the soul. Seest thou not how persons affected with
the plague, are inflamed: how they writhe about, how they are full of an ill scent, how disfigured
are their countenances: how wholly unclean they are? Such are they also that sin,

though they see it not. For, tell me, is not he who is possessed by the desire of riches or carnal
lust, worse than any one that is in a fever? Is he not more unclean than all these, when he
does and submits to all shameless things?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> For what is baser than a man who is in love with money? Whatever things women
that are harlots or on the stage refuse not to do neither does he <del>refuse</del>. Rather it is likely
that they would refuse <del>to do</del> a thing, rather than he. He even submits to do things fit for
slaves, flattering those whom he ought not; again he is overbearing where he ought not to
be, being inconsistent in every respect. He will sit by flattering wicked people, and oftentimes
depraved old men, that are of much poorer and meaner condition than himself; and will be
insolent and overbearing to others that are good and in all respects virtuous. Thou seest in
both respects the baseness, the shamelessness: he is both humble beyond measure, and
boastful.</p>
<p>Harlots however stand in front of their house, and the charge against them is that they
sell their body for money: yet, one may say, poverty and hunger compel them (although at
the most this is no sufficient excuse: for they might gain a livelihood by work). But the
covetous man stands, not before his house, but before the midst of the city, making over to
the devil not his body but his soul; so that he <del>the devil</del> is in his company, and goes in unto
him, as verily to a harlot: and having satisfied all his lusts departs; and all the city sees it, not
two or three persons only.</p>
<p>And this again is the peculiarity of harlots, that they are his who gives the gold. Even if
he be a slave or a gladiator,3063 or any person whatever, yet if he offers their hire, they receive
him. But the free, even should they be more noble than all, they do not accept without the
money. These men also do the same. They turn away right thoughts when they bring no
money; but they associate with the abominable, and actually with those that fight with wild
beasts,3064 for the sake of the gold, and associate with them shamelessly and destroy the
beauty of the soul. For as those women are naturally of odious appearance3065 and black,
and awkward and gross, and formless and ill-shaped, and in all respects disgusting, such do
the souls of these men become, not able to conceal their deformity by their outward paint-

word μόναχος had been at a very early period written by some copyists for μονομάχος (Mutianus has monachus
), and the interpolator misapprehending the drift of the passage had inserted κἂν ἐλεύθερος. Mr. Field many
years ago in earlier volumes of his edition, suggested the true reading here, as also the word θηριομάχοις (
bestialibus Mut.) just below, for which θεομάχοις had been substituted in the common texts. Both conjectures
are now confirmed by ms. authority. The gladiators, especially the bestiarii, who fought with wild beasts, were
regarded as a most degraded class.</note>

in their feigning.</p>
<p>For that shamelessness makes harlots, hear the prophet saying, “Thou wert shameless
towards all; thou hadst a harlot’s countenance.” ( Jer. iii. 3.) This may be said to the covetous
also: “Thou wert shameless towards all,” not towards these or those, but “towards all.” How?
Such an one respects neither father, nor son, nor wife, nor friend, nor brother, nor benefactor,
nor absolutely any one. And why do I say friend, and brother, and father? He respects not
God Himself, but all <del>we believe</del> seems to him a fable; and he laughs, intoxicated by his
great lust, and not even admitting into his ears any of the things which might profit him.</p>
<p>But O! their absurdity! and then what things they say! “Woe to thee, O Mammon, and
to him that has thee not.” At this I am torn to pieces with indignation: for woe to those who
say these things, though they say them in jest. For tell me, has not God uttered such a threat
as this, saying, “Ye cannot serve two masters”? ( Matt. vi. 24.) And dost thou set at nought3068
the threat? Does not Paul say that it is Idolatry, and does he not call “the covetous man an
Idolater”? ( Eph. v. 5.)</p>

who are on the stage. This has overthrown, this has cast down everything. Our affairs,3069
both our business3070 and our politeness, are turned into laughing; there is nothing steady,
nothing grave. I say not these things to men of the world only; but I know those whom I
am hinting at. For the Church has been filled with laughter. Whatever clever thing one may
say, immediately there is laughter among those present: and the marvelous thing is that
many do not leave off laughing even during the very time of the prayer.</p>
<p>Everywhere the devil leads the dance,3071 he has entered into all, is master of all. Christ
is dishonored, is thrust aside; the Church is made no account of. Do ye not hear Paul saying,
Let “filthiness and foolish talking and jesting” ( Eph. v. 4 ) be put away from you? He places
“jesting” along with “filthiness,” and dost thou laugh? What is “foolish talking”? that which
has nothing profitable. And dost thou, a solitary, laugh at all and relax thy countenance?
thou that art crucified? thou that art a mourner? tell me, dost thou laugh? Where dost thou
hear of Christ doing this? Nowhere: but that He was sad indeed oftentimes. For even when
He looked on Jerusalem, He wept; and when He thought on the Traitor He was troubled;
and when He was about to raise Lazarus, He wept; and dost thou laugh? If he who grieves

tribulation, of bruising and bringing matter <del>the body</del>, of conflicts and sweatings, and dost
thou laugh? Dost not thou see how Sarah was rebuked? dost thou not hear Christ saying,
“Woe to them that laugh, for they shall weep”? ( Luke vi. 25.) Thou chantest these things
every day, for, tell me, what dost thou say? “I have laughed?” By no means; but what? “I
labored in my groaning.” ( Ps. vi. 6.)</p>
<p>But perchance there are some persons so dissolute and silly as even during this very
rebuke to laugh, because forsooth we thus discourse about laughter. For indeed such is their
derangement, such their madness, that it does not feel the rebuke.</p>
<p>The Priest of God is Standing, offering up the prayer of all: and art thou laughing, having
no fears? And while he is offering up the prayers in trembling for thee, dost thou despise
all? Hearest thou not the Scripture saying, “Woe, ye despisers!” (cf. Acts xiii. 41 from Hab.
i. 5 ); dost thou not shudder? dost thou not humble thyself? Even when thou enterest a
royal palace, thou orderest thyself in dress, and look, and gait, and all other respects: and
here where there is the true Palace, and things like those of heaven, dost thou laugh? Thou
indeed, I know, seest <del>them</del> not, but hear thou that there are angels present everywhere,

Powers.</p>
<p>This my discourse is addressed to women also, who in the presence of their husbands
indeed do not dare readily to do this, and even if they do it, it is not at all times, but during
a season of relaxation, but here they do it always. Tell me, O woman, dost thou cover thine
head and laugh, sitting in the Church? Didst thou come in here to make confession of sins,
to fall down before God, to entreat and to supplicate for the transgressions thou hast
wretchedly committed, and dost thou do this with laughter? How then wilt thou be able to
propitiate Him?</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But (one says) what harm is there in laughter? There is no harm in laughter; the
harm is when it is beyond measure, and out of season. Laughter has been implanted in us,
that when we see our friends after a long time, we may laugh; that when we see any persons
downcast and fearful, we may relieve them by our smile; not that we should burst out violently3072
and be always laughing. Laughter has been implanted in our soul, that the soul
may sometimes be refreshed, not that it may be quite relaxed. For carnal desire also is implanted
in us, and yet it is not by any means necessary that because it is implanted in us,
therefore we should use it, or use it immoderately: but we should hold it in subjection, and
not say, Because it is implanted in us, let us use it.</p>

“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” ( Eccles. i. 2.) It is not I that say it, but he who had had the

then after all these things? “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” ( Eccles. xii. 8.)</p>
<p>Let us mourn therefore, beloved, let us mourn in order that we may laugh indeed, that
we may rejoice indeed in the time of unmixed joy. For with this joy <del>here</del> grief is altogether
mingled: and never is it possible to find it pure. But that is simple and undeceiving joy: it
has nothing treacherous, nor any admixture. In that joy let us delight ourselves; that let us
pursue after. And it is not possible to obtain this in any other way, than by choosing here
not what is pleasant, but what is profitable, and being willing to be afflicted a little, and
bearing all things with thanksgiving. For thus we shall be able to attain even to the Kingdom
of Heaven, of which may we all be counted worthy, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to
the Father be glory, together with the Holy Ghost, now and for ever and world without end.

<head>Homily XVI.</head>
<p>Hebrews ix. 15–23</p>
<p>“And for this cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death for the
redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called
might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance. For where a testament is, there must
also of necessity be the death of the testator.3074 For a testament is of force after men are
dead,3075 otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. Whereupon3076
neither the first <del>testament</del> was dedicated3077 without blood.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> It was probable that many of those who were more weakly would especially distrust
the promises of Christ because He had died. Paul accordingly out of a superabundance introduced
this illustration,3078 deriving it from common custom. Of what kind is it? He says,
“indeed, on this very account we ought to be of good courage.” On what account? Because
testaments are established and obtain their force when those who have made them are not
living, but dead. “And for this cause,” he says, “He is the Mediator of the New Testament.”
A Testament is made towards the last day, <del>the day</del> of death.</p>
<p>And a testament is of this character: It makes some heirs, and some disinherited. So in
this case also: “I will that where I am,” Christ says, “they also may be.” ( John xvii. 24.) And
again of the disinherited, hear Him saying, “I pray not for” all, “but for them that believe
on Me through their word.” ( John xvii. 20.) Again, a testament has relation both to the
testator, and to the legatees; so that they have some things to receive, and some to do. So
also in this case. For after having made promises innumerable, He demands also something
from them, saying, “a new commandment I give unto you.” ( John xiii. 34.) Again, a testament
ought to have witnesses. Hear Him again saying, “I am one that bear witness of Myself, and
He that sent Me beareth witness of Me.” ( John viii. 18.) And again, “He shall testify of Me”
<note type="footnote">3074 “of him that made it.”</note>

<note type="footnote">3077 “inaugurated.” [ἐ γκεκαίνισται. It cannot be denied that the word in the classics bears both the closely
related meanings of inaugurate and consecrate. The English editor has adopted the former throughout this
homily; but as the common meaning in the LXX. is consecrate, and as the common name of the festival of the
dedication of the restored temple was ἐ γκαίνια, it seems better to keep to the word adopted both by the A.V.
and the Revision.—F.G.]</note>

ye witness before God.”3079</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “And for this cause” (he says) “He is the Mediator of the New Testament.” What is
a “Mediator”? A mediator is not lord of the thing of which he is mediator, but the thing
belongs to one person, and the mediator is another: as for instance, the mediator of a marriage
is not the bridegroom, but one who aids him who is about to be married. So then also here:
The Son became Mediator between the Father and us. The Father willed not to leave us this
inheritance, but was wroth against us, and was displeased <del>with us</del> as being estranged <del>from
Him</del>; He accordingly became Mediator between us and Him, and prevailed with Him.</p>
<p>And what then? How did He become Mediator? He brought words from <del>Him</del> and
brought <del>them to us</del>, conveying over3080 what came from the Father to us, and adding His
own death thereto. We had offended: we ought to have died: He died for us and made us
worthy of the Testament. By this is the Testament secure, in that henceforward it is not
made for the unworthy. At the beginning indeed, He made His dispositions as a father for
sons; but after we had become unworthy, there was no longer need of a testament, but of
punishment.</p>
<p>Why then (he would say) dost thou think upon the law? For it placed us in a condition
of so great sin, that we could never have been saved, if our Lord had not died for us;3081 the
law would not have had power, for it is weak.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> And he established this no longer from common custom only, but also from what
happened under the old <del>Testament</del>: which especially influenced them. There was no one
who died there: how then could that <del>Testament</del> be firm? In the same way (he says). How?
For blood was there also, as there is blood here. And if it was not the blood of the Christ,
do not be surprised; for it was a type. “Whereupon,” he says, “neither was the first <del>Testament</del>
dedicated without blood.”</p>

<p>What is “was dedicated”? was confirmed, was ratified. The word “whereupon”3082
means “for this cause.” It was needful that the symbol of the Testament should be also that
of death.</p>
<p>For why (tell me) is the book of the testament sprinkled? ( Ver. 19, 20 ) “For” (he says)
“when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the
blood of calves, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself
and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto
you.” Tell me then why is the book of the testament sprinkled, and also the people, except
on account of the precious blood, figured from the first? Why “with hyssop”? It is close and
retentive.3083 And why the “water”? It shows forth also the cleansing by water. And why
the “wool”? this also <del>was used</del>, that the blood might be retained. In this place blood and
water show forth the same thing,3084 for baptism is His passion.3085</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 21, 22. “Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the
vessels of the ministry. And almost3086 all things are by the law purged with blood, and
without shedding of blood is no remission.” Why the “almost”? why did he qualify it? Because
those <del>ordinances</del> were not a perfect purification, nor a perfect remission, but half-complete
and in a very small degree. But in this case He says, “This is the blood3087 of the New Testament,
which is shed for you, for the remission of sins.” ( Matt. xxvi. 28.)</p>
<p>Where then is “the book”? He purified their minds. They themselves then were the
books of the New Testament. But where are “the vessels of the ministry”? They are themselves.
And where is “the tabernacle”? Again, they are; for “I will dwell in them,” He says, “and
walk in them.” ( 2 Cor. vi. 16.)</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But they were not sprinkled with “scarlet wool,” nor yet “with hyssop.” Why was
this? Because the cleansing was not bodily but spiritual, and the blood was spiritual. How?
It flowed not from the body of irrational animals, but from the Body prepared by the Spirit.
With this blood not Moses but Christ sprinkled us, through the word which was spoken;
“This is the blood of the New Testament, for the remission of sins.” This word, instead of
hyssop, having been dipped in the blood, sprinkles all. And there indeed the body was

cleansed outwardly, for the purifying was bodily; but here, since the purifying is spiritual,
it entereth into the soul, and cleanseth it, not being simply sprinkled over, but gushing forth
in our souls. The initiated understand what is said. And in their case indeed one sprinkled
just the surface; but he who was sprinkled washed it off again; for surely he did not go about
continually stained with blood. But in the case of the soul it is not so, but the blood is mixed
with its very substance, making it vigorous and pure, and leading it to the very unapproachable
beauty.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Henceforward then he shows that His death is the cause not only of confirmation,
but also of purification. For inasmuch as death was thought to be an odious thing, and especially
that of the cross, he says that it purified, even a precious purification, and in regard
to greater things. Therefore the sacrifices preceded, because of this blood. Therefore the
lambs; everything was for this cause.</p>
<p>Ver. 23. “It was therefore necessary that the Patterns”3088 (he says) “of the things in the
heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices
than these.”</p>
<p>And how are they “patterns3089 of things in the heavens”? And what does he mean now
by “the things in the heavens”? Is it Heaven? Or is it the Angels? None of these, but what is
ours.3090 It follows then that our things are in Heaven, and heavenly things are ours, even
though they be accomplished on earth; since although angels are on earth, yet they are called
Heavenly. And the Cherubim appeared on earth, but yet are heavenly. And why do I say
“appeared”? nay rather they dwell on earth, as indeed in Paradise: but this is nothing; for
they are heavenly.3091 And, “Our conversation is in Heaven” ( Philip. iii. 20 ), and yet we
live here.</p>
<p>“But these are the heavenly things,” that is, the philosophy which exists amongst us;
those who have been called thereto.3092</p>
<p>“With better sacrifices than these.” What is “better” is better than something [else] that
is good. Therefore “the patterns also of things in the heavens” have become good; for not

even the patterns were evil: else the things whereof they are patterns would also have been
evil.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> If then we are heavenly, and have obtained such a sacrifice,3093 let us fear. Let us
no longer continue on the earth; for even now it is possible for him that wishes it, not to be
on the earth. For to be and not to be on the earth is the effect of moral disposition and choice.
For instance; God is said to be in Heaven. Wherefore? not because He is confined by
space,3094 far from it, nor as having left the earth destitute of His presence, but by His relation
to and intimacy with3095 the Angels. If then we also are near to God, we are in Heaven. For
what care I about Heaven when I see the Lord of Heaven, when I myself am become a
Heaven? “For,” He says, “We will come,” I and the Father, “and will make our abode with
him.” ( John xiv. 23.)</p>
<p>Let us then make our soul a Heaven. The heaven is naturally bright; for not even in a
storm does it become black, for it does not itself change its appearance, but the clouds run
together and cover it. Heaven has the Sun; we also have the Sun of Righteousness. I said it
is possible to become a Heaven; and I see that it is possible to become even better than
Heaven. How? when we have the Lord of the Sun. Heaven is throughout pure and without
spot; it changes not either in a storm or in the night. Neither let us then be so influenced
either by tribulations or by “the wiles of the devil” ( Eph. vi. 11 ), but let us continue spotless
and pure. Heaven is high and far from the earth. Let us also effect this <del>as regards ourselves</del>;
let us withdraw ourselves from the earth, and exalt ourselves to that height, and remove
ourselves far from the earth. Heaven is higher than the rains and the storms, and is reached
by none of them. This we also can do, if we will.</p>
<p>It does appear to be, but is not really so affected. Neither then let us be affected, even if
we appear to be so. For as in a storm, most men know not the beauty of <del>heaven,</del> but think
that it is changed, while philosophers know that it is not affected at all, so with regard to
ourselves also in afflictions; most men think that we are changed with them, and that affliction
has touched our very heart, but philosophers know that it has not touched us.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Let us then become heaven, let us mount up to that height, and so we shall see men
differing nothing from ants. I do not speak of the poor only, nor the many, but even if there
be a general there, even if the emperor be there, we shall not distinguish the emperor, nor

translated “possession” or “reality,” it would give an excellent sense and one well in accordance with the context.—

the private person. We shall not know what is gold, or what is silver, or what is silken or
purple raiment: we shall see all things as if they were flies, if we be seated in that height.
There is no tumult there, no disturbance, nor clamor.</p>
<p>And how is it possible (one says) for him who walks on the earth, to be raised up to that
height? I do not tell it thee in words, but I show thee in fact those who have attained to that
height. Who then are they?</p>
<p>I mean such as Paul, who being on earth, spent their lives in heaven. But why do I say
“in heaven”? They were higher than the Heaven, yea than the other heaven, and mounted
up to God Himself. For, “who” (he says) “shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?” ( Rom.
viii. 35.) And again, “while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen.” ( 2 Cor. iv. 18.) Seest thou that he did not even see the things here? But to
show thee that he was higher than the heavens, hear him saying himself, “For I am persuaded
that neither death, or life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,
nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ.” ( Rom. viii. 38,
39.)</p>
<p>Seest thou how thought, hurrying past all things, made him higher not than this creation
only, not than these heavens, but even <del>than any other also</del> if any other there were? Hast
thou seen the elevation of his mind? Hast thou seen what the tent-maker became, because
he had the will, he who had spent his whole life in the market-place?</p>
<p><del>9.</del> For there is no hindrance, no not any, but that we may rise above all men, if we
have the will. For if we are so successful in arts that are beyond the reach of the generality,
much more in that which does not require so great labor.</p>
<p>For, tell me, what is more difficult than to walk along a tight rope, as if on level ground,
and when walking on high to dress and undress, as if sitting on a couch? Does not the performance
seem to us to be so frightful, that we are not even willing to look at it, but are terrified
and tremble at the very sight? And tell me, what is more difficult than to hold a pole
upon your face, and when you have put up a child upon it, to perform innumerable feats
and delight the spectators? And what is more difficult than to play at ball3096 with swords?
And tell me what is harder than thoroughly to search out the bottom of the sea? And one
might mention innumerable other arts.</p>
<p>But easier than all these, if we have the will, is virtue, and the going up into Heaven. For
here it is only necessary to have the will, and all <del>the rest</del> follows. For we may not say, I am
unable, neither accuse the Creator. For if He made us unable, and then commands, it is an
accusation against Himself.</p>

<pb n="836"/>
<p><del>10.</del> How is it then (some one says) that many are not able? How is it then that many
are not willing? For, if they be willing, all will be able. Therefore also Paul says, “I would
that all men were even as I myself” ( 1 Cor. vii. 7 ), since he knew that all were able to be as
himself. For he would not have said this, if it had been impossible. Dost thou wish to become
<del>such</del>? only lay hold on the beginning.</p>
<p>Tell me now, in the case of any arts, when we wish to attain them, are we content with
wishing, or do we also engage with the things themselves?3097 As for instance, one wishes
to become a pilot; he does not say, I wish, and content himself with that, but he also puts
his hand to the work. He wishes to become a merchant; he does not merely say, I wish, but
he also puts his hand to the work. Again he wishes to travel abroad, and he does not say, I
wish, but he puts his hand to the work. In everything then, wishing alone is not sufficient,
but work must also be added; and when thou wishest to mount up to heaven, dost thou
merely say, “I wish”?</p>
<p>How then (he says) saidst thou that willing is sufficient? <del>I meant</del> willing joined with
deeds, the laying hold on the thing itself, the laboring. For we have God working with us,
and acting with us. Only let us make our choice, only let us apply ourselves to the matter as
to work, only let us think earnestly about it, only let us lay it to heart, and all follows. But if
we sleep on, and as we snore expect to enter into heaven, how shall we be able to obtain the
heavenly inheritance?</p>
<p>Let us therefore be willing, I exhort you, let us be willing. Why do we carry on all our
traffic with reference to the present life, which to-morrow we shall leave? Let us choose then
that Virtue which will suffice us through all eternity: wherein we shall be continually, and
shall enjoy the everlasting good things; which may we all attain, in Christ Jesus our Lord,
with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, power, honor, now and for
ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews ix. 24–26</p>
<p>“For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures3098 of
the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor yet that
He should offer Himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the Holy Place every year
with blood of others, for then must He often have suffered since the foundation of the
world. But now, once,3099 in the end of the world hath He appeared to put away3100 sin
by the sacrifice of Himself.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The Jews greatly prided themselves on the temple and the tabernacle. Wherefore
they said, “The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord.” ( Jer.
vii. 4.) For nowhere else in the earth was such a temple constructed as this, either for costliness,
or beauty, or anything else. For God who ordained it, commanded that it should be
made with great magnificence, because they also were more attracted and urged on by material
things. For it had bricks of gold in the walls; and any one who wishes may learn this
in the second <del>book</del> of Kings, and in Ezekiel, and how many talents of gold were then expended.</p>
<p>But the second <del>temple</del> was a more glorious building, both on account of its beauty,
and in all other respects. Nor was it reverenced for this reason only, but also from its being
One. For they were wont to resort thither from the uttermost parts of the earth, whether
from Babylon or from Ethiopia. And Luke shows this when he says in the Acts: “There were
dwelling” there “Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in
Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the
parts of Libya about Cyrene.” ( Acts ii. 5, 9, 10.) They then who lived in all parts of the world
assembled there, and the fame of the temple was great.</p>
<p>What then does Paul do? What <del>he did</del> in regard to the sacrifices, that also he does
here. For as there he set against <del>them</del> the death of Christ, so here also he sets the whole
heaven against the temple.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And not by this alone did he point out the difference, but also by adding that The
Priest is nearer to God: for he says, “to appear in the presence3101 of God.” So that he made

the matter august, not only by the <del>consideration of</del> heaven, but also by <del>that of Christ’s</del>
entering in <del>there</del>. For not merely through symbols as here, but He sees God Himself there.</p>
<p>Seest thou that condescension through the lowly things have been said throughout?
Why dost thou then any longer wonder that He intercedes there, where He places Himself
as a High Priest? “Nor yet, that He should offer Himself often, as the High Priest.”</p>
<p>“For Christ is not entered into the Holy Places made with hands” (he says) “which are
the figures3102 of the True.” (These then are true; and those are figures,3103 for the temple
too has been so arranged,3104 as the Heaven of Heavens.)</p>
<p>What sayest thou? He who is everywhere present, and who filleth all things, doth not
He “appear”3105 unless He enter into Heaven? Thou seest that all these things pertain to
the flesh.</p>
<p>“To appear,” he says, “in the presence of God for us.” What is “for us”? He went up (he
means) with a sacrifice which had power to propitiate the Father. Wherefore (tell me)? Was
He an enemy? The angels were enemies, He was not an enemy. For that the Angels were
enemies, hear what he says, “He made peace as to things on earth and things in Heaven.”3106
( Col. i. 20.) So that He also “entered into Heaven, now to appear in the presence of God
for us.” He “now appeareth,” but “for us.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the
Holy place every year with blood of others.” Seest Thou how many are the differences? The
“often” for the “once”; “the blood of others,” for “His own.”3107 Great is the distance. He is
Himself then both victim and Priest and sacrifice. For if it had not been so, and it had been
necessary to offer many sacrifices, He must have been many times crucified. “For then,” he
says, “He must often have suffered since the foundation of the world.”</p>
<p>In this place he has also veiled over3108 something. “But now once more in the end of
the world.” Why “at the end of the world”? After the many sins. If therefore, it had taken
place at the beginning, then no one would have believed; and He must not die a second

time, all would have been useless. But since later, there were many transgressions, with
reason He then appeared: which he expresses in another place also, “Where sin abounded,
grace did much more abound. But now once in the end of the world, hath He appeared to
put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.” ( Rom. v. 20.)</p>
<p><del>4.</del> ( Ver. 27 ) “And as it is appointed3109 unto men once to die, but after this, the
Judgment.” He next says also why He died once <del>only</del>: because He became a ransom by
one death. “It had been appointed” (he says) “unto men once to die.” This then is <del>the
meaning of</del> “He died once,”3110 for all.3111 (What then? Do we no longer die that death?
We do indeed die, but we do not continue in it: which is not to die at all. For the tyranny of
death, and death indeed, is when he who dies is never more allowed to return to life. But
when after dying is living, and that a better life, this is not death, but sleep.) Since then death
was to have possession of all, therefore He died that He might deliver us.</p>
<p>Ver. 28. “So Christ was once3112 offered.” By whom offered? evidently by Himself. Here
he says that He is not Priest only, but Victim also, and what is sacrificed.3113 On this account
are <del>the words</del> “was offered.” “Was once offered” (he says) “to bear3114 the sins of many.”
Why “of many,” and not “of all”? Because not all believed. For He died indeed for all, that
is His part: for that death was a counterbalance3115 against the destruction of all men. But
He did not bear the sins of all men, because they were not willing.</p>
<p>And what is <del>the meaning of</del> “He bare the sins”? Just as in the Oblation we bear up our
sins and say, “Whether we have sinned voluntarily or involuntarily, do Thou forgive,”3116
that is, we make mention of them first, and then ask for their forgiveness. So also was it
done here. Where has Christ done this? Hear Himself saying, “And for their sakes I sanctify3117
Myself.” ( John xvii. 19.) Lo! He bore the sins. He took them from men, and bore

that He might forgive them.</p>
<p>“Unto them that look for Him shall He appear” (he says) “the second time without sin
unto salvation.” What is “without sin”? it is as much as to say, He sinneth not. For neither
did He die as owing the debt of death, nor yet because of sin. But how “shall He appear”?
To punish, you say. He did not however say this, but what was cheering; “shall He appear
unto them that look for Him, without sin unto salvation.” So that for the time to come they
no longer need sacrifices to save themselves, but to do this by deeds.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> ( Chap. x. 1.) “For” (he says) “the Law having a shadow of the good things to come,
not the very image of the things”; i.e. not the very reality. For as in painting, so long as one
<del>only</del> draws the outlines, it is a sort of “shadow” but when one has added the bright paints
and laid in the colors, then it becomes “an image.” Something of this kind also was the Law.</p>
<p>“For” (he says) “the Law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image
of the things,” i.e. of the sacrifice, of the remission: “can never by those sacrifices3118 with3119
which they offered continually make the comers thereunto perfect.” ( Ver. 2–9 ) “For then
would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once purged, should
have had no more conscience of sins? But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again
made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
away sins. Wherefore when He cometh into the world, He saith, Sacrifice and offering Thou
wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared Me. In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin
Thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo! I come, in the volume of the book it is written
of Me, to do Thy will, O God. Above when He said, Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings,
and <del>offering</del> for sin Thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein, which are
offered by the Law, then He said, Lo! I come to do Thy will, O God! He taketh away the first
that He may establish the second.”</p>
<p>Thou seest again the superabundance <del>of his proofs</del>? This sacrifice (he says) is one;
whereas the others were many: therefore they had no strength, because they were many.
For, tell me, what need of many, if one had been sufficient? so that their being many, and
offered “continually,” proves that they [the worshipers] were never made clean. For as a
medicine, when it is powerful and productive of health, and able to remove the disease entirely,
effects all after one application; as, therefore, if being once applied it accomplishes
the whole, it proves its own strength in being no more applied, and this is its business, to
be no more applied; whereas if it is applied continually, this is a plain proof of its not having
strength. For it is the excellence of a medicine to be applied once, and not often. So is it in

this case also. Why forsooth are they continually cured with the “same sacrifices”? For if
they were set free from all their sins, the sacrifices would not have gone on being offered
every day. For they had been appointed to be continually offered in behalf of the whole
people, both in the evening and in the day. So that there was an arraignment of sins, and
not a release from sins; an arraignment of weakness, not an exhibition of strength. For because
the first had no strength, another also was offered: and since this effected nothing, again
another; so that it was an evidence of sins. The “offering” indeed then, was an evidence of
sins, the “continually,” an evidence of weakness. But with regard to Christ, it was the contrary:
He was “once offered.” The types3120 therefore contain the figure only, not the power; just
as in images, the image has the figure of the man, not the power. So that the reality and the
type have <del>somewhat</del> in common with one another. For the figure exists equally in both,
but not the power. So too also is it in respect of Heaven and of the tabernacle, for the figure
was equal: for there was the Holy of Holies, but the power and the other things were not
the same.</p>
<p>What is, “He hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself”?3121 What is
this “putting away”? it is making contemptible. For sin has no longer any boldness; for it is
made of no effect in that when it ought to have demanded3122 punishment, it did not demand
it: that is, it suffered violence: when it expected to destroy all men, then it was itself destroyed.</p>
<p>“He hath appeared by the sacrifice of Himself” (he says), that is, “He hath appeared,”
unto God, and drawn near <del>unto Him</del>. For do not <del>think</del> because the High Priest was wont
to do this oftentimes in the year.<gap reason=" omitted"/>3123 So that henceforward this is done in vain, although
it is done; for what need is there of medicines where there are no wounds? On this account
He ordained offerings “continually,” because of their want of power, and that a remembrance
of sins might be made.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> What then? do not we offer every day? We offer indeed, but making a remembrance
of His death, and this3124 <del>remembrance</del> is one and not many. How is it one, and not many?

Inasmuch as that3125 <del>Sacrifice</del> was once for all offered, <del>and</del> carried into the Holy of
Holies. This is a figure of that <del>sacrifice</del> and this remembrance of that.3126 For we always
offer the same,3127 not one sheep now and to-morrow another, but always the same thing:3128
so that the sacrifice is one. And yet by this reasoning, since the offering is made in many
places, are there many Christs? but Christ is one everywhere, being complete here and
complete there also, one Body. As then while offered in many places, He is one body and
not many bodies; so also <del>He is</del> one sacrifice. He is our High Priest, who offered the sacrifice
that cleanses us. That we offer now also, which was then offered, which cannot be exhausted.
This is done in remembrance of what was then done. For (saith He) “do this in remembrance
of Me.” ( Luke xxii. 19.) It is not another sacrifice, as the High Priest, but we offer3129 always
the same, or rather we perform a remembrance of a Sacrifice.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> But since I have mentioned this sacrifice, I wish to say a little in reference to you
who have been initiated; little in quantity, but possessing great force and profit, for it is not
our own, but the words of Divine Spirit. What then is it? Many partake of this sacrifice once
in the whole year, others twice; others many times. Our word then is to all; not to those only
who are here, but to those also who are settled in the desert.3130 For they partake once in
the year, and often indeed at intervals of two years.</p>
<p>What then? which shall we approve? those <del>who receive</del> once <del>in the year</del>? those who
<del>receive</del> many times? those who <del>receive</del> few times? Neither those <del>who receive</del> once, nor
those <del>who receive</del> often, nor those <del>who receive</del> seldom, but those <del>who come</del> with a
pure conscience, from a pure heart, with an irreproachable life. Let such draw near continually;
but those who are not such, not even once. Why, you will ask? Because they receive to
themselves judgment, yea and condemnation, and punishment, and vengeance. And do not
wonder. For as food, nourishing by nature, if received by a person without appetite, ruins
and corrupts all [the system], and becomes an occasion of disease, so surely is it also with
respect to the awful mysteries. Dost thou feast at a spiritual table, a royal table, and again
pollute thy mouth with mire? Dost thou anoint thyself with sweet ointment, and again fill
thyself with ill savors?</p>
<p>Tell me, I beseech thee, when after a year thou partakest of the Communion, dost thou
think that the Forty Days3131 are sufficient for thee for the purifying of the sins of all that

time? And again, when a week has passed, dost thou give thyself up to the former things?
Tell me now, if when thou hast been well for forty days after a long illness, thou shouldest
again give thyself up to the food which caused the sickness, hast thou not lost thy former
labor too? For if natural things are changed, much more those which depend on choice. As
for instance, by nature we see, and naturally we have healthy eyes; but oftentimes from a
bad habit <del>of body</del> our power of vision is injured. If then natural things are changed, much
more those of choice. Thou assignest forty days for the health of the soul, or perhaps not
even forty, and dost thou expect to propitiate God? Tell me, art thou in sport?</p>
<p>These things I say, not as forbidding you the one and annual coming, but as wishing
you to draw near continually.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> These things have been given to the holy. This the Deacon also proclaims when he
calls on the holy;3132 even by this call searching the faults of all. For as in a flock, where
many sheep indeed are in good health, but many are full of the scab, it is needful that these
should be separated from the healthy; so also in the Church: since some sheep are healthy,
and some diseased, by this voice he separates the one from the other, the priest <del>I mean</del>
going round on all sides by this most awful cry, and calling and drawing on3133 the holy.
For it is not possible that a man should know the things of his neighbor, (for “what man,”
he says, “knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?”— 1 Cor. ii.
11 ): he utters this voice after the whole sacrifice has been completed, that no person should
come to the spiritual fountain carelessly and in a chance way. For in the case of the flock
also (for nothing prevents us from again using the same example), the sickly ones we shut
up within, and keep them in the dark, and give them different food, not permitting them
to partake either of pure air, or of simple grass, or of the fountain without [the fold]. In this
case then also this voice is instead of fetters.</p>
<p>Thou canst not say, ‘I did not know, I was not aware that danger attends the matter.’
Nay surely Paul too especially testified this. But wilt thou say, ‘I never read it’? This is not
an apology, but even an accusation. Dost thou come into the Church every day and yet art
ignorant of this?</p>
<p>However, that thou mayest not have even this excuse to offer, for this cause, with a loud
voice, with an awful cry, like some herald lifting up his hand on high, standing aloft, conspicuous
to all, and after that awful silence crying out aloud, he invites some, and some he
forbids, not doing this with his hand, but with his tongue more distinctly than with his hand.
For that voice, falling on our ears, just like a hand, thrusts away and casts out some, and
introduces and presents others.</p>
<note type="footnote">3132 After the Oblation was made and before the Communion the deacon proclaimed τὰ ἅγια τοῖς ἁγίοις,
“The Holy things for the holy.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3133 ἕ λκων</note>

<pb n="844"/>
<p>Tell me then, I beseech <del>you</del>, in the Olympic games does not the herald stand, calling
out with loud and uplifted voice, saying, “Does any one accuse this man? Is he a slave? Is
he a thief? Is he one of wicked manners?” And yet, those contests for prizes are not of the
soul nor yet of good morals, but of strength and the body. If then where there is exercise of
bodies, much examination is made about character, how much rather here, where the soul
is alone the combatant. Our herald then even now stands, not holding each person by the
head, and drawing him forward, but holding all together by the head within; he does not
set against them other accusers, but themselves against themselves. For he says not, “Does
any one accuse this man?” but what? “If any man accuse himself.” For when he says, The
Holy things for the holy, he means this: “If any is not holy, let him not draw near.”</p>
<p>He does not simply say, “free from sins,” but, “holy.” For it is not merely freedom from
sins which makes a man holy, but also the presence of the Spirit, and the wealth of good
works. I do not merely wish (he says) that you should be delivered from the mire, but also
that you should be bright and beautiful. For if the Babylonian King, when he made choice
of the youths from the captives, chose out those who were beautiful in form, and of fair
countenance: much more is it needful that we, when we stand by the royal table, should be
beautiful in form, <del>I mean</del> that of the soul, having adornment of gold, our robe pure, our
shoes royal, the face of our soul well-formed, the golden ornament put around it, even the
girdle of truth. Let such an one as this draw near, and touch the royal cups.</p>
<p>But if any man clothed in rags, filthy, squalid, wish to enter in to the royal table, consider
how much he will suffer, the forty days not being sufficient to wash away the offenses which
have been committed in all the time. For if hell is not sufficient, although it be eternal (for
therefore also it is eternal), much more this short time. For we have not shown a strong repentance,
but a weak.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Eunuchs especially ought to stand by the King: by eunuchs, I mean those who are
clear in their mind, having no wrinkle nor spot, lofty in mind, having the eye of the soul
gentle and quick-sighted, active and sharp, not sleepy nor supine; full of much freedom,
and yet far from impudence and overboldness, wakeful, healthful, neither very gloomy and
downcast, nor yet dissolute and soft.</p>
<p>This eye we have it in our own power to create, and to make it quicksighted and beautiful.
For when we direct it, not to the smoke nor to the dust (for such are all human things), but
to the delicate breeze, to the light air, to things heavenly and high, and full of much calmness
and purity, and of much delight, we shall speedily restore it, and shall invigorate it, as it
luxuriates in such contemplation. Hast thou seen covetousness and great wealth? do not
thou lift up thine eye thereto. The thing is mire, it is smoke, an evil vapor, darkness, and
great distress and suffocating cares. Hast thou seen a man cultivating righteousness, content
with his own, and having abundant space for recreation, having anxieties, not fixing his
thoughts on things here? Set <del>thine eye</del> there, and lift <del>it</del> up on high; and thou wilt make

<pb n="845"/>
it far the most beautiful, and more splendid, feasting it not with the flowers of the earth, but
with those of virtue, with temperance, moderation, and all the rest. For nothing so troubles
the eye as an evil conscience (“Mine eye,” it is said, “was troubled by reason of anger”— Ps.
vi. 7 ); nothing so darkens it. Set it free from this injury, and thou wilt make it vigorous and
strong, ever nourished with good hopes.</p>
<p>And may we all make both it and also the other energies of the soul, such as Christ desires,
that being made worthy of the Head who is set over us, we may depart thither where
He wishes. For He saith, “I will that where I am, they also may be with Me, that they may
behold My glory.” ( John xvii. 24.) Which may we all enjoy in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XVIII.</head>
<p>Hebrews x. 8–13</p>
<p>“Above when He said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings, and <del>offering</del> for sin, Thou
wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure <del>therein</del>, which are offered by3134 the Law, then
said He, Lo! I come to do Thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that He may establish
the second. By the which will we are3135 sanctified, by the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ, once for all.3136 And every Priest standeth daily ministering, and offering oftentimes
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this <del>man</del> after He had offered
one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting
till His enemies be made His footstool.”3137</p>
<p><del>1.</del> In what has gone before he had shown that the sacrifices were unavailing for perfect
purification, and were a type, and greatly defective. Since then there was this objection to
his argument, If they are types, how is it that, after the truth is come, they have not ceased,
nor given place, but are still performed? he here accordingly labors at this very point,
showing that they are no longer performed, even as a figure, for God does not accept them.
And this again he shows not from the New <del>Testament</del>, but from the prophets, bringing
forward from times of old the strongest testimony, that it <del>the old system</del> comes to an end,
and ceases, and that they do all in vain, “alway resisting the Holy Ghost.” ( Acts vii. 51.)
And he shows over and above that they cease not now <del>only</del>, but at the very coming of
the Messiah, nay rather, even before His coming: and how it was that Christ did not abolish
them at the last, but they were abolished first, and then He came; first they were made to
cease, and then He appeared. That they might not say, Even without this sacrifice, and by
means of those, we could have been well pleasing unto God, He waited for these sacrifices
to be convicted <del>of weakness</del>, and then He appeared; for (He says) “sacrifice and offering
Thou wouldest not.” Hereby He took all away; and having spoken generally, He says also
particularly, “In burnt-offerings and <del>sacrifice</del> for sin Thou hadst no pleasure.” But “the
offering” was everything except the sacrifice. “Then said I, Lo! I come.” Of whom was this
spoken? of none other than the Christ.</p>
<p>Here he does not blame those who offer, showing that it is not because of their
wickednesses that He does not accept them, as He says elsewhere, but because the thing itself
has been convicted for the future and shown to have no strength, nor any suitableness to
<note type="footnote">3134 “according to.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3135 “have been.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3136 ἐ φάπαξ</note>

<pb n="847"/>
the times.3138 What then has this to do with the “sacrifices” being offered “oftentimes”? Not
only from their being “oftentimes” <del>offered</del> (he means) is it manifest that they are weak,
and that they effected nothing; but also from God’s not accepting them, as being unprofitable
and useless. And in another place it is said, “If Thou hadst desired sacrifice I would have
given it.” ( Ps. li. 16.) Therefore by this also he makes it plain that He does not desire it.
Therefore sacrifices are not God’s will, but the abolition of sacrifices. Wherefore they sacrifice
contrary to His will.</p>
<p>What is “To do Thy will”? To give up Myself, He means: This is the will of God. “By
which Will we are sanctified.” Or he even means something still further, that the sacrifices
do not make men clean, but the Will of God. Therefore to offer sacrifice is not the will of
God.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> And why dost thou wonder that it is not the will of God now, when it was not His
will even from the beginning? For “who,” saith He, “hath required this at your hands?” (
Isa. i. 12.)</p>
<p>How then did He Himself enjoin it? In condescension. For as Paul says, “I would3139
that all men were even as I myself” ( 1 Cor. vii. 7 ), in respect of continence, and again says,
“I will3140 that the younger women marry, bear children” ( 1 Tim. v. 14 ); and lays down
two wills, yet the two are not his own, although he commands; but the one indeed is his
own, and therefore he lays it down without reasons; while the other is not his own, though
he wishes it, and therefore it is added with a reason. For having previously accused them,
because “they had waxed wanton against Christ” ( 1 Tim. v. 11 ), he then says, “I will that
the younger women marry, bear children.” ( 1 Tim. v. 14.) So in this place also it was not
His leading will that the sacrifices should be offered. For, as He says, “I wish not the death
of the sinner, as that he should turn unto [Me] and live” ( Ezek. xxxiii. 11 ): and in another
place He says that He not only wished, but even desired3141 this: and yet these are contrary
to each other: for intense wishing is desire. How then dost Thou “not wish”? how dost Thou
in another place “desire,” which is a sign of vehement wishing? So is it in this case also.</p>
<p>“By the which will we are sanctified,” he says. How sanctified? “by the offering of the
Body of Jesus Christ once for all.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice.”
(To stand therefore is a sign of ministering; accordingly to sit, is a sign of being
ministered unto.) “But this <del>man</del> after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat

down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till His enemies be made His
footstool.” ( Ver. 14, 15 ) “For by one offering He hath perfected forever them that are
sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us.” He had said that those <del>sacrifices</del>
are not offered; he reasoned from what is written, <del>and</del> from what is not written;3142
moreover also he put forward the prophetic word which says, “sacrifice and offering Thou
wouldest not.” He had said that He had forgiven their sins. Again this also He proves from
the testimony of what is written, for “the Holy Ghost” (he says) “is a witness to us: for after
that He had said,” ( ver. 16–18 ) “This is the covenant, that I will make with them, after those
days, saith the Lord: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,
and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is
there is no more offering for sin.” So then He forgave their sins, when He gave the Covenant,
and He gave the Covenant by sacrifice. If therefore He forgave the sins through the one
sacrifice, there is no longer need of a second.</p>
<p>“He sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting.” Why the delay?
“that His enemies be put under His feet. For by one offering He hath perfected for ever them
that are sanctified.” But perhaps some one might say; Wherefore did He not put them under
at once? For the sake of the faithful who should afterwards be brought forth and born.
Whence then <del>does it appear</del> that they shall be put under? By the saying “He sat down.”
He called to mind again that testimony which saith, “until I put the enemies under His feet.”
(See above, i. 13.) But His enemies are the Jews. Then since he had said, “Till His enemies
be put under His feet,” and they <del>these enemies3143</del> were vehemently urgent, therefore he
introduces all his discourse concerning faith after this. But who are the enemies? All unbelievers:
the dæmons. And intimating the greatness of their subjection, he said not “are subjected,”
but “are put under His feet.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Let us not therefore be of <del>the number of</del> His enemies. For not they alone are enemies,
the unbelievers and Jews, but those also who are full of unclean living. “For the carnal
mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be.” (
Rom. viii. 7.) What then (you say)? this is not a ground of blame. Nay rather, it is very much
a ground of blame. For the wicked man as long as he is wicked, cannot be subject <del>to God’s
law</del>; he can however change and become good.</p>
<p>Let us then cast out carnal minds. But what are carnal? Whatever makes the body
flourish and do well, but injures the soul: as for instance, wealth, luxury, glory (all these
<note type="footnote">3142 That is from other arguments than the words of the Old Testament.</note>

things are of the flesh), carnal love. Let us not then love gain, but ever follow after poverty:
for this is a great good.</p>
<p>But (you say) it makes one humble and of little account. <del>True:</del> for we have need of
this, for it benefits us much. “Poverty” (it is said) “humbles a man.” ( Prov. x. 4 , LXX.) And
again Christ <del>says</del>, “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” ( Matt. v. 3.) Dost thou then grieve because
thou art upon a path leading to virtue? Dost thou not know that this gives us great confidence?</p>
<p>But, one says, “the wisdom of the poor man is despised.” ( Eccles. ix. 16.) And again
another says, “Give me neither riches nor poverty” ( Prov. xxx. 8 ), and, “Deliver me from
the furnace of poverty.”3144 (See Isa. xlviii. 10.) And again, if riches and poverty are from
the Lord, how can either poverty or riches be an evil? Why then were these things said?
They were said under3145 the Old <del>Covenant</del>, where there was much account made of
wealth, where there was great contempt of poverty, where the one was a curse and the other
a blessing. But now it is no longer so.</p>
<p>But wilt thou hear the praises of poverty? Christ sought after it, and saith, “But the Son
of Man hath not where to lay His head.” ( Matt. viii. 20.) And again He said to His disciples,
“Provide3146 neither gold, nor silver, nor two coats.” ( Matt. x. 9, 10.) And Paul in writing
said, “As having nothing and yet possessing all things.” ( 2 Cor. vi. 10.) And Peter said to
him who was lame from his birth, “Silver and gold have I none.” ( Acts iii. 6.) Yea and under
the Old <del>Covenant</del> itself, where wealth was held in admiration, who were the admired?
Was not Elijah, who had nothing save the sheepskin? Was not Elisha? Was not John?</p>
<p>Let no man then be humiliated on account of his poverty: It is not poverty which humiliates,
but wealth, which compels us to have need of many, and forces us to be under obligations
to many?</p>
<p>And what could be poorer than Jacob (tell me), who said, “If the Lord give me bread to
eat, and raiment to put on”? ( Gen. xxviii. 20.) Were Elijah and John then wanting in boldness?
3147 Did not the one reprove Ahab, and the other Herod? The latter said, “It is not
lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife.” ( Mark vi. 18.) And Elias said to Ahab with
boldness, “It is not I that trouble Israel, but thou and thy father’s house.” ( 1 Kings xviii. 18.)
Thou seest that this especially produces boldness; poverty <del>I mean</del>? For while the rich man
is a slave, being subject to loss, and in the power of every one wishing to do him hurt, he
who has nothing, fears not confiscation, nor fine. So, if poverty had made men wanting in
boldness Christ would not have sent His disciples with poverty to a work requiring great
<note type="footnote">3144 The words of the LXX. are “He took me out of the furnace of poverty.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3145 or “in,” ἐ ν</note>
<note type="footnote">3146 or “get.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3147 ἀ παρρησίαστοι</note>

<pb n="850"/>
boldness. For the poor man is very strong, and has nothing wherefrom he may be wronged
or evil entreated. But the rich man is assailable on every side: just in the same way as one
would easily catch a man who was dragging many long ropes after him, whereas one could
not readily lay hold on a naked man. So here also it falls out in the case of the rich man:
slaves, gold, lands, affairs innumerable, innumerable cares, difficult circumstances, necessities,
make him an easy prey to all.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Let no man then henceforth esteem poverty a cause of disgrace. For if virtue be
there, all the wealth of the world is neither clay, nor even a mote in comparison of it. This
then let us follow after, if we would enter into the kingdom of heaven. For, He saith, “Sell
that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven.” ( Matt. xix.
21.) And again, “It is hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.” ( Matt. xix.
23.) Dost thou see that even if we have it not, we ought to draw it to us? So great a good is
Poverty. For it guides us by the hand, as it were, on the path which leads to Heaven, it is an
anointing for the combat, an exercise great and admirable, a tranquil haven.</p>
<p>But (you say) I have need of many <del>things</del>, and am unwilling to receive a favor from
any. Nevertheless, even in this respect the rich man is inferior to thee; for thou perhaps
askest the favor for thy support, but he shamelessly <del>asks</del> for ten thousand things for covetousness’
sake. So that it is the rich that are in need of many <del>persons</del>, yea oftentimes those
who are unworthy of them. For instance, they often stand in need of those who are in the
rank of soldiers, or of slaves: but the poor man has no need even of the Emperor himself,
and if he should need him, he is admired because he has brought himself down to this, when
he might have been rich.</p>
<p>Let no man then accuse poverty as being the cause of innumerable evils, nor let him
contradict Christ, who declared it to be the perfection of virtue, saying, “If thou wilt be
perfect.” ( Matt. xix. 21.) For this He both uttered in His words, and showed by His acts,
and taught by His disciples. Let us therefore follow after poverty, it is the greatest good to
the sober-minded.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of those who hear me, avoid it as a thing of ill omen. I do not doubt it.3148
For this disease is great among most men, and such is the tyranny of wealth, that they cannot
even as far as words endure the renunciation of it, but avoid it as of ill omen. Far be this
from the Christian’s soul: for nothing is richer than he who chooses poverty of his own accord,
and with a ready mind.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> How? I will tell you, and if you please, I will prove that he who chooses poverty of
his own accord is richer even than the king himself. For he indeed needs many <del>things</del>, and
is in anxiety, and fears lest the supplies for the army should fail him; but the other has enough
of everything, and fears about nothing, and if he fears, it is not about so great matters. Who

then, tell me, is the rich man? he who is daily asking, and earnestly laboring to gather much
together, and fears lest at any time he should fall short, or he who gathers nothing together,
and is in great abundance and hath need of no one? For it is virtue and the fear of God, and
not possessions which give confidence. For these even enslave. For it is said, “Gifts and
presents blind the eyes of the wise, and like a muzzle on the mouth turn away reproofs.” (
Ecclus. xx. 29.)</p>
<p>Consider how the poor man Peter chastised the rich Ananias. Was not the one rich and
the other poor? But behold the one speaking with authority and saying, “Tell me whether
ye sold the land for so much” ( Acts v. 8 ), and the other saying with submission, “Yea, for
so much.” And who (you say) will grant to me to be as Peter? It is open to thee to be as Peter
if thou wilt; cast away what thou hast. “Disperse, give to the poor” ( Ps. cxii. 9 ), follow
Christ, and thou shalt be such as he. How? he (you say) wrought miracles. Is it this then,
tell me, which made Peter an object of admiration, or the boldness which arose from his
manner of life? Dost thou not hear Christ saying, “Rejoice not because the devils are subject
unto you; If thou wilt be perfect <del>U+0026c</del>.” ( Luke x. 20.) Hear what Peter says: “Silver and gold
have I none, but what I have I give thee.” ( Acts iii. 6.) If any man have silver and gold, he
hath not those other gifts.</p>
<p>Why is it then, you say, that many have neither the one nor the other? Because they are
not voluntarily poor: since they who are voluntarily poor have all good things. For although
they do not raise up the dead nor the lame, yet, what is greater than all; they have confidence
towards God. They will hear in that day that blessed voice, “Come, ye blessed of My Father,”
(what can be better than this?) “inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world: for I was an hungered and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave Me drink:
I was a stranger and ye took Me in: I was naked and ye clothed Me: I was sick and in prison
and ye visited Me. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”
( Matt. xxv. 34–36.) Let us then flee from covetousness, that we may attain to the kingdom
[of Heaven]. Let us feed the poor, that we may feed Christ: that we may become fellow-heirs
with Him in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost,
be glory, power, honor, now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews x. 19–23</p>
<p>“Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new
and living way which He hath consecrated 3149 for us, through the Veil, that is to say, His
flesh, and having an High Priest3150 over the house of God, let us draw near with a true
heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and
our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession3151 of our hope without
wavering.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
by a new and living way which He hath consecrated for us.” Having shown the difference
of the High Priest, and of the sacrifices, and of the tabernacle, and of the Covenant, and of
the promise, and that the difference is great, since those are temporal, but these eternal,
those “near to vanishing away,” these permanent, those powerless, these perfect, those figures,
these reality, for (he says) “not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according
to the power of an endless life.” ( c. vii. 16.) And “Thou art a Priest for ever.” ( c. v. 6.) Behold
the continuance of the Priest. And concerning the Covenant, That (he says) is old (for “that
which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away”— c. viii. 13 ), but this is new; and
has remission of sins, while that [has] nothing of the kind: for (he says) “the Law made
nothing perfect.” ( c. vii. 19.) And again, “sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not.” ( c. x.
5.) That is made with hands, while this is “not made with hands” ( c. ix. 11 ): that “has the
blood of goats” ( c. ix. 12 ), this of the Lord ; that has the Priest “standing,” this “sitting.”
Since therefore all those are inferior and these greater, therefore he says, “Having therefore,
brethren, boldness.”</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “Boldness”: from whence? As sins (he means) produce shame, so the having all
things forgiven us, and being made fellow-heirs, and enjoying so great Love, <del>produces</del>
boldness.</p>
<p>“For the entrance into the holiest.” What does he mean here by “entrance”? Heaven,
and the access to spiritual things.</p>
<p>“Which he hath inaugurated,”3152 that is, which He prepared, and which He began; for
the beginning of using is thenceforth called the inaugurating; which He prepared (he means)
and by which He Himself passed.</p>
<note type="footnote">3149 “new made” or “inaugurated.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3150 “a great Priest.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3151 “confession.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3152 ἐ νεκαίνισε, “consecrated.”</note>

<pb n="853"/>
<p>“A new and living way.” Here He expresses “the full assurance of hope.” “New,” he says.
He is anxious to show that we have all things greater; since now the gates of Heaven have
been opened, which was not done even for Abraham. “A new and living way,” he says, for
the first was a way of death, leading to Hades, but this of life. And yet he did not say, “of
life,” but called it “living,” (the ordinances, that is,) that which abideth.3153</p>
<p>“Through the veil” (he says) “of His flesh.” For this flesh first cut that way, by this He
inaugurated it <del>the way</del> by which He walked. And with good reason did he call <del>the flesh</del>
“a veil.”3154 For when it was lifted up on high, then the things in heaven appeared.</p>
<p>“Let us draw near” (he says) “with a true heart.” To what should we “draw near”? To
the holy things, the faith, the spiritual service. “With a true heart, in full assurance of faith,”
since nothing is seen; neither the priest henceforward, nor the sacrifice, nor the altar. And
yet neither was that priest visible, but stood within, and they all without, the whole people.
But here not only has this taken place, that the priest has entered into the holy of holies, but
that we also enter in. Therefore he says, “in full assurance of faith.” For it is possible for the
doubter to believe in one way, as there are even now many who say, that of some there is a
resurrection and of others not. But this is not faith. “In full assurance of faith” (he says); for
we ought to believe as concerning things that we see, nay, even much more; for “here” it is
possible to be deceived in the things that are seen, but there not: “here” we trust to the senses,
but there to the Spirit.</p>
<p>“Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.” He shows that not faith only,
but a virtuous life also is required, and the consciousness to ourselves of nothing evil. Since
the holy of holies does not receive “with full assurance” those who are not thus disposed.
For they are holy, and the holy of holies; but here no profane person enters. They were
sprinkled as to the body, we as to the conscience, so that we may even now be sprinkled
over with virtue itself. “And having our body washed with pure water.” Here he speaks of
the Washing, which no longer cleanses the bodies, but the soul.</p>
<p>“For He is faithful that promised.” “That promised” what? That we are to depart thither
and enter into the kingdom. Be then in nothing over-curious, nor demand reasonings. Our
<del>religion</del>3155 needs faith.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> ( Ver. 24, 25 ) “And” (he says) “let us consider one another to provoke unto love
and to good works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
<note type="footnote">3153 ἀ λλὰ ζῶσαν αὐτὴν ἐκάλεσε· τουτέστι, τὰ προστάγματα, τὴν μένουσαν. This is the reading of all the

some is, but exhorting3156 one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.”
And again in other places, “The Lord is at hand; be careful for nothing.” ( Philip. iv. 5, 6.)
“For now is our salvation nearer: Henceforth the time is short.” ( Rom. xiii. 11.)</p>
<p>What is, “not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together”? ( 1 Cor. vii. 29.) He knew
that much strength arises from being together and assembling together. “For where two or
three” (it is said) “are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them” (
Matt. xviii. 20 ); and again, “That they may be One, as we” also are ( John xvii. 11 ); and,
“They had all one heart and <del>one</del> soul.” ( Acts iv. 32.) And not this only, but also because
love is increased by the gathering <del>of ourselves</del> together; and love being increased, of necessity
the things of God must follow also. “And earnest prayer” (it is said) was “made by” the
people. ( Acts xii. 5.) “As the manner of some is.” Here he not only exhorted, but also blamed
<del>them</del>.</p>
<p>“And let us consider one another,” he says, “to provoke unto3157 love and to good
works.” He knew that this also arises from “gathering together.” For as “iron sharpeneth
iron” ( Prov. xvii.17 ), so also association increases love. For if a stone rubbed against a stone
sends forth fire, how much more soul mingled with soul! But not unto emulation (he says)
but “unto the sharpening of love.” What is “unto the sharpening of love”? Unto the loving
and being loved more. “And of good works”; that so they might acquire zeal. For if doing
has greater force for instruction than speaking, ye also have in your number many teachers,
who effect this by their deeds.</p>
<p>What is “let us draw near with a true heart”? That is, without hypocrisy; for “woe be to
a fearful heart, and faint hands” ( Ecclus. ii. 12 ): let there be (he means) no falsehood among
us; let us not say one thing and think another; for this is falsehood; neither let us be fainthearted,
for this is not <del>a mark</del> of a “true heart.” Faintheartedness comes from not believing.
But how shall this be? If we fully assure ourselves through faith.</p>
<p>“Having our hearts sprinkled”: why did he not say “having been purified”? <del>Because</del>
he wished to point out the difference of the sprinklings: the one he says is of God, the other
our own. For the washing and sprinkling the conscience is of God; but “the drawing near
with” truth and “in full assurance of faith” is our own. Then he also gives strength to their
faith from the truth of Him that promised.</p>
<p>What is “and having our bodies washed with pure water”? With water which makes
pure; or which has no blood.</p>
<note type="footnote">3156 or, “encouraging.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3157 εἰς παροξυσμὸν, “to the sharpening” or “exciting of.”</note>

<pb n="855"/>
<p>Then he adds the perfect thing, love. “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves togeth-
er,” which some (he says) do, and divide the assemblies.3158 For “a brother helped by a
brother is as a strong city.” ( Prov. xviii. 19 , LXX.)</p>
<p>“But let us consider one another to provoke unto love.” What is, “let us consider one
another”? For instance if any be virtuous, let us imitate him, let us look on him so as to love
and to be loved. For from Love good works proceed. For the assembling is a great good:
since it makes love more warm; and out of love all good things arise. For nothing is good
which is not done through love.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> This then let us “confirm”3159 towards each other. “For love is the fulfilling of the
law.” ( Rom. xiii. 10.) We have no need of labors or of sweatings if we love one another. It
is a pathway leading of itself towards virtue. For as on the highway, if any man find the beginning,
he is guided by it, and has no need of one to take him by the hand; so is it also in
regard to Love: only lay hold on the beginning, and at once thou art guided and directed by
it. “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor” ( Rom. xiii. 10 ); “thinketh no evil.” ( 1 Cor. xiii. 5.)
Let each man consider with himself, how he is disposed toward himself. He does not envy
himself; he wishes all good things for himself; he prefers himself before all; he is willing to
do all things for himself. If then we were so disposed towards others also, all grievous things
are brought to an end; there is no enmity; there is no covetousness: for who would choose
to overreach himself? No man; but on the contrary we shall possess all things in common,
and shall not cease assembling ourselves together. And if we do this, the remembrance of
injuries would have no place: for who would choose to remember injuries against himself?
Who would choose to be angry with himself? Do we not make allowances for ourselves most
of all? If we were thus disposed towards our neighbors also, there will never be any remembrance
of injuries.</p>
<p>And how is it possible (you say) that one should so love his neighbor as himself? If
others had not done this, you might well think it impossible: but if they have done it, it is
plain that from indolence it is not done by ourselves.</p>
<p>And besides, Christ enjoins nothing impossible, seeing that many have even gone beyond
His commands. Who has done this? Paul, Peter, all the company of the Saints. Nay, indeed
if I say that they loved their neighbors, I say no great matter: they so loved their enemies as
no man would love those who were likeminded with himself. For who would choose for the
sake of those likeminded, to go away into Hell. when he was about to depart unto a kingdom?
No man. But Paul chose this for the sake of his enemies, for those who stoned him, those
who scourged him. What pardon then will there be for us, what excuse, if we shall not show
<note type="footnote">3158 [The English edition here inserts, “This he forbids them [to do],” from τοῦτο αὐτοῖς ἀπαγορεύει of the
Benedictine text, supported by some mss., but omitted by Mr. Field.—F.G.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3159 See 2 Cor. ii. 8</note>

<pb n="856"/>
towards our friends even the very smallest portion of that love which Paul showed towards
his enemies?</p>
<p>And before him too, the blessed Moses was willing to be blotted out of God’s book for
the sake of his enemies who had stoned him. David also when he saw those who had stood
up against him slain, saith, “I, the shepherd, have sinned, but these, what have they done?”
(See 2 Sam. xxiv. 17.) And when he had Saul in his hands, he would not slay him, but saved
him; and this when he himself would be in danger. But if these things were done under the
Old <del>Covenant</del> what excuse shall we have who live under the New, and do not attain even
to the same measure with them? For if, “unless our righteousness exceed that of the Scribes
and Pharisees, we shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven” ( Matt. v. 20 ), how shall we
enter in when we have even less than they?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> “Love your enemies,” He says. ( Matt. v. 44.) Love thou therefore thy enemy: for
thou art doing good not to him, but to thyself. How? Thou art becoming like God. He, if he
be beloved of thee, hath no great gain, for he is beloved by a fellow-slave; but thou, if thou
love thy fellow-slave, hast gained much, for thou art becoming like God. Seest thou that
thou art doing a kindness not to him but to thyself? For He appoints the prize not for him,
but for thee.</p>
<p>What then if he be evil (you say)? So much the greater is the reward. Even for his
wickedness thou oughtest to feel grateful to him: even should he be evil after receiving ten
thousand kindnesses. For if he were not exceedingly evil, thy reward would not have been
exceedingly increased; so that the reason <del>thou assignest</del> for not loving him, the saying that
he is evil, is the very reason for loving him. Take away the contestant and thou takest away
the opportunity for the crowns. Seest thou not the athletes, how they exercise when they
have filled the bags with sand? But there is no need for thee to practice this. Life is full of
things that exercise thee, and make thee strong. Seest thou not the trees too, the more they
are shaken by the winds, so much the more do they become stronger and firmer? We then.
if we be long-suffering, shall also become strong. For it is said, “a man who is long-suffering
abounds in wisdom, but he that is of a little soul is strongly foolish.” ( Prov. xiv. 29.) Seest
thou how great is his commendation of the one, seest thou how great his censure of the
other? “Strongly foolish,” i.e. very <del>foolish</del>. Let us not then be faint-hearted3160 one towards
another: for this does not rise from enmity, but from having a small soul. As if the soul be
strong, it will endure all things easily, and nothing will be able to sink it, but will lead it into
tranquil havens. To which may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor,
now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews x. 26, 27</p>
<p>“For if we sin willfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no
more3161 sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation3162
which shall devour the adversaries.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Trees which have been planted, and have had the advantage of all other care, and
the hands and the labors of the cultivator, and yet yield no return for the labors, are pulled
up by the roots, and handed over to the fire. So somewhat of this kind takes place also in
the case of our Illumination.3163 For when Christ has planted us, and we have enjoyed the
watering of the Spirit, and then show no fruit; fire, even that of Hell, awaits us, and flame
unquenchable.</p>
<p>Paul therefore having exhorted them to love and to bringing forth the fruit of good
works, and having urged them from the kindlier <del>considerations</del> (What are these? That we
have an entrance into the holy of holies, “the new way which He hath inaugurated for us.”—
c. x. 20 ), does the same again from the more gloomy ones, speaking thus. For having said,
“not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting3164
one another, and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching” ( c. x. 25 ), this
being sufficient for consolation, he added, “For if we sin willfully after we have received the
knowledge of the truth.” There is need, he means, of good works, yea, very great need, “For
if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no
more sacrifice for sins.” Thou wast cleansed; thou wast set free from the charges against
thee, thou hast become a son. If then thou return to thy former vomit, there awaits thee on
the other hand excommunication and fire and whatever such things there are. For there is
no second sacrifice.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> At this place we are again assailed by those who take away repentance,3165 and by
those who delay to come to baptism. The one saying, that it is not safe for them to come to
baptism, since there is no second remission: And the other asserting that it is not safe to
impart the mysteries3166 to those who have sinned, if there is no second remission.</p>
<note type="footnote">3161 οὐκέτι</note>
<note type="footnote">3162 lit. “indignation of fire.”</note>

<pb n="858"/>
<p>What shall we say then to them both? That he does not take away repentance, nor the
propitiation through repentance, nor does he thrust away and cast down with despair the
fallen. He is not thus an enemy of our salvation; but what? He takes away the second
Washing. For he did not say, no more3167 is there repentance, or no more is there remission,
but “no more” is there a “sacrifice,” that is, there is no more a second Cross.3168 For this is
what he means by sacrifice. “For by one sacrifice,” he says, “He hath perfected forever them
that are sanctified” ( c. x. 14 ); not like the Jewish <del>rites.</del>. For this reason he has treated so
much throughout concerning the Sacrifice, that it is one, even one; not wishing to show this
only, that herein it differed from the Jewish <del>rites</del>, but also to make <del>men</del> more steadfast,
so that they might no longer expect another sacrifice according to the Jewish law.</p>
<p>“For,” saith he, “if we sin willfully.” See how he is disposed to pardon. He says, “if we
sin willfully,” so that there is pardon for those <del>who sin</del> not willfully. “After the knowledge
of the truth”: He either means, of Christ, or of all doctrines. “There remaineth no more
sacrifice for sins,” but what? “A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation
which shall devour the adversaries.” By “Adversaries” he means not the unbelievers, but
those also who do what is against virtue; or <del>else he means</del> that the same fire shall receive
them of the household also, which <del>receives</del> “the adversaries.” Then expressing its devouring
nature, he says, as if giving it life, “fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.”
For as a wild beast when irritated and very fierce and savage, would not rest till it could lay
hold on some one and eat him up; so also that fire, like one goaded by indignation, whatever
it can lay hold of does not let go, but devours and tears it to pieces.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Next he adds also the reason of the threat, that it is on good grounds, that it is just;
for this contributes to confidence, when we show that it is just.</p>
<p>For, he says, ( ver. 28 ) “He that hath despised Moses’ law dies without mercy, under
two or three witnesses.” “Without mercy,” he says; so that there is no pardon, no pity there
although the law is of Moses; for he ordained the most of it.</p>
<p>What is “under two or three”? If two or three bore witness, he means, they immediately
suffered punishment.</p>
<p>If then under the Old <del>Covenant</del>, when the law of Moses is set at nought, there is so
great punishment, ( ver. 29 ) “Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood
of the covenant an unholy <del>a common</del> thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of
grace?”</p>
<p>And how does a man “tread under foot the Son of God”? When partaking of Him in
the mysteries (he would say) he has wrought sin, has he not trodden Him under foot? Has
<note type="footnote">3167 οὐκέτι</note>
<note type="footnote">3168 Compare Hom. ix. [5], p. 410.</note>

<pb n="859"/>
he not despised Him? For just as we make no account of those who are trodden under foot,
so also, they who sin have made no account of Christ; and so they have sinned. Thou art3169
become the Body of Christ, and givest thou thyself to the devil, so that he treads thee under
foot.</p>
<p>“And accounted the blood a common thing,” he says. What is “common”? It is “unclean,”
or the having nothing beyond other things.</p>
<p>“And done despite unto the Spirit of grace.” For he that accepts not a benefit, does
despite to the benefactor. He made thee a son: and thou wishest to become a slave. He came
to dwell with thee, and thou bringest in wicked imaginations to Him. Christ wished to stay
with thee: and thou treadest Him down by surfeiting, by drunkenness.</p>
<p>Let us listen, whoever partake of the mysteries unworthily: let us listen, whoever approach
that Table unworthily. “Give not” (He says) “that which is holy unto the dogs, lest in time
they trample them under their feet” ( Matt. vii. 6 ), that is, lest they despise, lest they repudiate
<del>them</del>. Yet he did not say this, but what was more fearful than this. For he constrains their
souls by what is fearful. For this also is adapted to convert, no less than consolation. And at
the same time he shows both the difference, and the chastisement, and sets forth the judgment
upon them, as though it were an evident matter. “Of how much sorer punishment, suppose
ye, shall he be thought worthy?” Here also he appears to me to hint at the mysteries.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Next he adds testimony, saying, ( ver. 31, 30 ) “It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the Living God.” “For” it is written: “Vengeance <del>belongeth</del> unto Me, I will recompense,
saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.” “Let us fall,” it is said,
“into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.” ( Ecclus. ii. 18.3170) But if ye
repent not, ye shall “fall into the hands of” God: that is fearful: it is nothing, to “fall into the
hands of men.” When, he means, we see any man punished here, let us not be terrified at
the things present, but shudder at the things to come. “For according to His mercy, so is
His wrath.”3171 And, “His indignation will rest upon sinners.” ( Ecclus. v. 6.)</p>
<p>At the same time too he hints at something else. For “Vengeance <del>belongeth</del> unto Me,”
he says, “I will recompense.” This is said in regard to their enemies, who are doing evil, not
to those who are suffering evil. Here he is consoling them too, all but saying, God abideth
for ever and liveth, so that even if they receive not <del>their reward</del> now, they will receive it
hereafter. They ought to groan, not we: for we indeed shall fall into their hands, but they

into the hands of God. For neither is it the sufferer who suffers the ill, but he that does it;
nor is it he who receives a benefit that is benefited, but the benefactor.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Knowing then these things, let us be patient as to suffering evil, forward as to
kindnesses. And this will be, if we think lightly of wealth and honor. He that hath stripped
himself of those affections, is of all men most generous, and more wealthy even than he who
wears the purple. Seest thou not how many evils come through money? I do not say how
many through covetousness, but merely by our attachment to these things. For instance, if
a man has lost his money, he leads a life more wretched than any death. Why grievest thou,
O man? why weepest thou? Because God has delivered Thee from excessive watching? Because
thou dost not sit trembling and fearful? Again, if any one chain thee to a treasure,
commanding thee to sit there perpetually, and to keep watch for other people’s goods, thou
art grieved, thou art disgusted; and dost thou, after thou hast bound thyself with most
grievous chains, grieve when thou art delivered from the slavery? Truly sorrows and joys
are <del>matters</del> of fancy.3172 For we guard them as if we had another’s.</p>
<p>Now my discourse is for the women. A woman often has a garment woven with gold,
and this she shakes, wraps up in linen, keeps with care, trembles for it, and has no enjoyment
of it. For either she dies, or she becomes a widow. Or, even if none of these things happen,
yet from fear lest wearing it out by continual use, she should deprive herself of it, she deprives
herself of it in another way, by sparing it. But she passes it on [you say] to another. But
neither is this clear: and even if she should pass it on, the other again will also use it in the
same way. And if any one will search their houses, he will find that the most costly garments
and other choice things, are tended with special honor, as if they were living masters. For
she does not use them habitually, but fears and trembles, driving away moths and the other
things that are wont to eat them, and laying most of them in perfumes and spices, nor permitting
all persons to be counted worthy of the sight of them, but oftentimes carefully putting
them in order herself with her husband.</p>
<p>Tell me: did not Paul with reason call covetousness “idolatry”? ( Col. iii. 5.) For these
show as great honor to their garments, their gold, as they to their idols.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> How long shall we stir up the mire? How long shall we be fixed to the clay and the
brickmaking? For as they toiled for the King of the Egyptians, so do we also toil for the
devil, and are scourged with far more grievous stripes. For by how much the soul surpasses
the body, by so much does anxiety the weals of scourging. We are scourged every day, we
are full of fear, in anxiety, in trembling. But if we will groan, if we will look up to God, He
sendeth to us, not Moses, nor Aaron, but His own Word, and compunction. When this
<del>word</del> has come, and taken hold of our souls, He will free from the bitter slavery, He will
bring us forth out of Egypt, from unprofitable and vain zeal, from slavery which brings no
<note type="footnote">3172 προληψεως [preoccupation.—F.G.].</note>

<pb n="861"/>
gain. For they indeed went forth after having at least received golden <del>ornaments</del>, the wages
for building, but we <del>receive</del> nothing: and would it were nothing. For indeed we also receive,
not golden ornaments, but the evils of Egypt, sins and chastisements and punishments.</p>
<p>Let us then learn to be made use of, let us learn to be spitefully treated; this is the part
of a Christian. Let us think lightly of golden raiment, let us think lightly of money, that we
may not think lightly of our salvation. Let us think lightly of money and not think lightly
of the soul. For this is chastised, this is punished: those things remain here, but the soul departeth
yonder. Why, tell me, dost thou cut thyself to pieces, without perceiving it?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> These things I say to the overreaching. And it is well to say also to those who are
overreached. Bear their overreachings generously; they are ruining themselves, not you.
You indeed they defraud of your money, but they strip themselves of the good will and help
of God. And he that is stripped of that, though he clothe himself with the whole wealth of
the world, is of all men most poor: and so he who is the poorest of all, if he have this, is the
wealthiest of all. For “the Lord” (it is said) “is my shepherd, and I shall lack nothing.” ( Ps.
xxiii. 1.)</p>
<p>Tell me now, if thou hadst had a husband, a great and admirable man, who thoroughly
loved thee and cared for thee, and then knewest that he would live always, and not die before
thee, and would give thee all things to enjoy in security, as thine own: wouldst thou then
have wished to possess anything? Even if thou hadst been stripped of all, wouldst thou not
have thought thyself the richer for this?</p>
<p>Why then dost thou grieve? Because thou hast no property? But consider that thou hast
had the occasion of sin taken away. But is it because thou hadst [property] and hast been
deprived of it? But thou hast acquired the good will of God. And how have I acquired it
(you say)? He has said, “Wherefore do ye not rather suffer wrong?” ( 1 Cor. vi. 7.) He hath
said, “Blessed are they who bear all things with thankfulness.” 3173 Consider therefore how
great good will thou wilt enjoy, if thou showest forth those things by <del>thy</del> works. For one
thing only is required from us, “in all things to give thanks” to God, and <del>then</del> we have all
things in abundance. I mean, for instance: hast thou lost ten thousand pounds of gold?
Forthwith give thanks unto God, and thou hast acquired ten times ten thousand, by that
word and thanksgiving.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> For tell me when dost thou account Job blessed? When he had so many camels, and
flocks, and herds, or when he uttered that saying: “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken
away”? ( Job i. 21.) Therefore also the devil causes us losses, not that he may take away our
goods only, for he knows that is nothing, but that through them he may compel us to utter
some blasphemy. So in the case of the blessed Job too, he did not strive after this only, to
<note type="footnote">3173 It does not appear what passage of Scripture St. Chrys referred to: the altered text has, “He hath said: ‘
In everything give thanks. ’ He hath said, ‘ Blessed are the poor in spirit. ’”</note>

<pb n="862"/>
make him poor, but also to make him a blasphemer. At any rate, when he had stripped him
of every thing, observe what he says to him through his wife, “Say some word against the
Lord, and die.” ( Job ii. 9.) And yet, O accursed one, thou hadst stripped him of everything.
‘But’ (he says) ‘this is not what I was striving for; for I have not yet accomplished that for
which I did all. I was striving to deprive him of God’s help: for this cause I deprived him of
his goods too. This is what I wish, that other is nothing. If this be not gained, he not only
has not been injured at all, but has even been benefited.’ Thou seest that even that wicked
demon knows how great is the loss in this matter?</p>
<p>And see him plotting the treachery through the wife. Hear this, ye husbands, as many
as have wives that are fond of money, and compel you to blaspheme God. Call Job to mind.
But let us see, if it please you, his great moderation, how he silenced her. “Wherefore” (he
says) “hast thou spoken as one of the foolish women [speaketh]?” ( Job ii. 10.) Of a truth
“evil communications corrupt good manners” ( 1 Cor. xv. 33 ), at all times indeed, but
particularly in calamities: then they who give evil advice have strength. For if the soul is
even of itself prone to impatience, how much more, when there is also an adviser. Is it not
thrust into a pit? A wife is a great good, as also a great evil. For because a wife is a great
<del>good</del>, observe from what point he <del>Satan</del> wishes to break through the strong wall. ‘The
depriving him of his property’ (he says) ‘did not take him; the loss has produced no great
effect.’ Therefore he says, ‘If indeed he will curse thee to thy face.’ ( Job ii. 5.) You see
whither he was aspiring.3174</p>
<p>If then we bear <del>losses</del> thankfully, we shall recover even these things; and if we should
not recover them, our reward will be greater. For when he had wrestled nobly, then God
restored to him these things also. When He had shown the devil, that it is not for these
things that he serves Him, then He restored them also to him.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> For such is He. When God sees that we are not riveted to things of this life, then
He gives them to us. When He sees that we set a higher value on things spiritual, then He
also bestows on us things carnal. But not first, lest we should break away from things spiritual:
and to spare us He does not give carnal things, to keep us away from them, even against
our will.</p>
<p>Not so (you say) but if I receive <del>them</del>, I am satisfied, and am the more thankful. It is
false, O man, for then especially wilt thou be thoughtless.</p>
<p>Why then (you say) does He give <del>them</del> to many? Whence is it clear, that He gives
<del>them</del>? But who else, you say, gives? Their overreaching, their plundering. How then does
He allow these things? As He also <del>allows</del> murders, thefts, and violence.</p>
<p>What then (you will say) as to those who receive by succession an inheritance from their
fathers, being themselves full of evils innumerable? And what of this? How does God suffer
<note type="footnote">3174 που ἔπνει</note>

<pb n="863"/>
them (you say) to enjoy these things? Surely just as He allows thieves, and murderers, and
other evil doers. For it is not now the time of judgment, but of the best course of life.</p>
<p>And what I just now said, that I repeat, that they shall suffer greater punishment, who,
when they have enjoyed all good things, do not even so become better. For all shall not be
punished alike; but they who, even after His benefits, have continued evil, shall suffer a
greater punishment, while they who after poverty <del>have done this</del> not so. And that this is
true, hear what He says to David, “Did I not give thee all thy master’s goods?” ( 2 Sam. xii.
8.) Whenever then thou seest a young man that has received a paternal inheritance without
labor and continues wicked, be assured that his punishment is increased and the vengeance
is made more intense. Let us not then emulate these; but if any man has succeeded to virtue,
if any man has obtained spiritual wealth, [him let us emulate]. For (it is said) “Woe to them
that trust in their riches” (cf. Ps. xlix. 6 ): “Blessed are they that fear the Lord.” ( Ps. cxxviii.
1.) To which of these, tell me, wouldst thou belong? Doubtless to those who are pronounced
blessed. Therefore emulate these, not the other, that thou also mayest obtain the good things
which are laid up for them. Which may we all obtain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom
to the Father be glory together with the Holy Ghost, now and for ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXI.</head>
<p>Hebrews x. 32–34</p>
<p>“But call to remembrance the former days, in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a
great fight of afflictions;3175 partly, whilst ye were made a gazing stock both by reproaches
and afflictions,3176 and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
For ye had compassion on those who were in bonds,3177 and took joyfully the spoiling of
your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves3178 in heaven a better and an enduring
substance.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The best Physicians after they have made a deep incision, and have increased the
pains by the wound, soothing the afflicted part, and giving rest and refreshment to the disturbed
soul, proceed not to make a second incision, but rather soothe that which has been
made with gentle remedies, and such as are suited to remove the violence of the pain. This
Paul also did after he had shaken their souls, and pierced them with the recollection of Hell,
and convinced then, that he must certainly perish, who does despite to the grace of God,
and after he had shown from the laws of Moses, that they also shall perish, and the more
<del>fearfully</del>, and confirm it by other testimonies, and had said, “It is a fearful thing to fall into
the hands of the Living God” ( c. x. 31 ): then, lest the soul desponding through excessive
fear, should be swallowed up with grief, he soothes them by commendations and exhortation,
and gives them zeal derived from their own conduct. For, he says, “call to remembrance the
former days, in which after ye had been enlightened, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.”
Powerful is the exhortation from deeds <del>already done</del>: for he who begins a work ought to
go forward and add to it. As if he had said, when ye were brought in3179 <del>to the Church</del>,
when ye were in the rank of learners, ye displayed so great readiness, so great nobleness;
but now it is no longer so. And he who encourages, does thus especially encourage them
from their own example.</p>

<p>And he did not simply say, “ye endured a fight”3180 but a “great” <del>fight</del>. Moreover he
did not say “temptations” but “fight,” which is an expression of commendation and of very
great praise.</p>
<p>Then he also enumerates them particularly, amplifying his discourse, and multiplying
his praise. How? “Partly” (he says) “whilst ye were made a gazing-stock by reproaches and
afflictions”; for reproach is a great thing, and calculated to pervert the soul, and to darken
the judgment. For hear what the prophet says:3181 “While they daily say unto me, Where
is thy God?” ( Ps. xlii. 10.) And again, “If the enemy had reproached me, I would have borne
it.” ( Ps. lv. 12.) For since the human race is exceedingly vainglorious, therefore it is easily
overcome by this.</p>
<p>And he did not simply say “by reproaches,” but that even with great intensity, being
“made a gazing-stock.”3182 For when a person is reproached alone, it is indeed painful, but
far more so when in presence of all. For tell me how great the evil was when men who had
left the meanness of Judaism, and gone over, as it were, to the best course of life, and despised
the customs of their fathers, were ill treated by their own people, and had no help.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> I cannot say (he says) that ye suffered these things indeed and were grieved, but ye
even rejoiced exceedingly. And this he expressed by saying, “Whilst ye became companions
of them that were so used,” and he brings forward the Apostles themselves. Not only (he
means) were ye not ashamed of your own sufferings, but ye even shared with others who
were suffering the same things. This too is the language of one who is encouraging them.
He said not, ‘Bear my afflictions, share with me,’ but respect your own.</p>
<p>“Ye had compassion on them that were in bonds.”3183 Thou seest that he is speaking
concerning himself and the rest who were in prison. Thus ye did not account “bonds” to be
bonds: but as noble wrestlers so stood ye: for not only ye needed no consolation in your
own <del>distresses</del>, but even became a consolation to others.</p>
<p>And “ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods.” O! what “full assurance of faith”! ( c.
x. 22.) Then he also sets forth the motive, not only consoling them for their struggles, but
also that they might not be shaken from the Faith. When ye saw your property plundered
(he means) ye endured; for already ye saw Him who is invisible, as visible: which was the
effect of genuine faith, and ye showed it forth by your deeds themselves.</p>
<p>Well then, the plundering was perhaps from the force of the plunderers, and no man
could prevent it; so that as yet it is not clear, that ye endured the plundering for the faith’s
sake. (Although this too is clear. For it was in your power if you chose, not to be plundered,
<note type="footnote">3180 ἄ θλησιν, a contest, as that of wrestlers.</note>

by not believing.) But ye did what is far greater than this; the enduring such things even
“with joy”; which was altogether apostolical, and worthy of those noble souls, who rejoiced
when scourged. For, it says, “they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that
they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name.”3184 ( Acts v. 41.) But he that endures
“with joy,” shows that he has some reward, and that the affair is no loss but a gain.</p>
<p>Moreover the expression “ye took”3185 shows their willing endurance, because, he
means, ye chose and accepted.</p>
<p>“Knowing” (he says) “that ye have for yourselves in heaven a better and an enduring
substance”; instead of saying, firm, not perishing like this.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> In the next place, having praised them, he says, ( ver. 35 ) “Cast not away therefore
your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.” What meanest thou? He did not
say, ‘ye have cast it away, and recover it’: but, which tended more to strengthen them, “ye
have it,” he says. For to recover again that which has been cast away, requires more labor:
but not to lose that which is held fast does not. But to the Galatians he says the very opposite:
“My children of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you” ( Gal. iv. 19 );
and with reason; for they were more supine, whence they needed a sharper word; but these
were more faint-hearted, so that they rather needed what was more soothing.</p>
<p>“Cast not away therefore” (he says) “your confidence,” so that they were in great confidence
towards God. “Which hath” (he says) “great recompense of reward.” “And when shall
we receive them (some one might say)? Behold! All things on our part have been done.”
Therefore he anticipated them on their own supposition, saying in effect, If ye know that
ye have in heaven a better substance, seek nothing here.</p>
<p>“For ye have need of patience,” not of any addition <del>to your labors</del>, that ye may continue
in the same state, that ye may not cast away what has been put into your hands. Ye need
nothing else, but so to stand as ye have stood, that when ye come to the end, ye may receive
the promise.</p>
<p>( Ver. 36 ) “For” (he says) “ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of
God, ye might receive the promise.” Ye have need of one thing only, to bear with the delay;
not that ye should fight again. Ye are at the very crown (he means); ye have borne all the
combats of bonds, of afflictions; your goods have been spoiled. What then? Henceforward
ye are standing to be crowned: endure this only, the delay of the crown. O the greatness of
the consolation! It is as if one should speak to an athlete who had overthrown all, and had
no antagonist, and then was to be crowned, and yet endured not that time, during which

the president of the games comes, and places the crown <del>upon him</del>; and he impatient,
should wish to go out, and escape as though he could not bear the thirst and the heat.</p>
<p>He then also hinting this, what does he say? ( Ver. 37 ) “Yet a little while and He that
shall come will come, and will not tarry.” For lest they should say, And when will He come?
He comforts them from the Scriptures. For thus also when he says in another place, “Now
is our salvation nearer” ( Rom. xiii. 11 ), he comforts them because the remaining time is
short. And this he says not of himself but from the Scriptures.3186 But if from that time it
was said, “Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry,” it is plain
that now He is nearer. Wherefore also waiting is no small reward.</p>
<p>( Ver. 38 ) “Now the just” (he says) “shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, My
soul shall have no pleasure in him.” This is a great encouragement when one shows that
they have succeeded in the whole matter and are losing it through a little indolence. ( Ver.
39 ) “But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the
saving of the soul.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> ( c. xi. 1, 2 ) “Now faith is the substance3187 of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.” O what an expression has he
used, in saying, “an evidence of things not seen.” For <del>we say</del> there is “evidence,” in the
case of things that are very plain.3188 Faith then is the seeing things not plain (he means),
and brings what are not seen to the same full assurance with what are seen. So then neither
is it possible to disbelieve in things which are seen, nor, on the other hand can there be faith
unless a man be more fully assured with respect to things invisible, than he is with respect
to things that are most clearly seen. For since the objects of hope seem to be unsubstantial,
Faith gives them substantiality,3189 or rather, does not give it, but is itself their substance.3190
For instance, the Resurrection has not come, nor does it exist substantially, but hope makes
it substantial in our soul. This is [the meaning of] “the substance of things.”</p>
<p>If therefore it is an “evidence of things not seen,” why forsooth do you wish to see them,
so as to fall away from faith, and from being just?3191 Since “the just shall live by faith,”
<note type="footnote">3186 It is to be observed that the words “He that cometh will come and will not tarry,” are from the prophet

whereas ye, if ye wish to see these things, are no longer faithful. Ye have labored (he says),
ye have struggled: I too allow this, nevertheless, wait; for this is Faith: do not seek the whole
“here.”</p>
<p><del>5.</del> These things were indeed said to the Hebrews, but they are a general exhortation
also to many of those who are here assembled. How and in what way? To the faint-hearted;
to the mean-spirited. For when they see the wicked prospering, and themselves faring ill,
they are troubled, they bear it impatiently: while they long for the chastisement, and the
inflicting vengeance on others; while they wait for the rewards of their own sufferings. “For
yet a little time, and He that shall come will come.”</p>
<p>Let us then say this to the slothful: Doubtless there will be punishment; doubtless He
will come, henceforth the events of the3192 Resurrection are even at the doors.</p>
<p>Whence <del>does</del> that <del>appear</del> (you say)? I do not say, from the prophets; for neither do
I now speak to Christians only; but even if a heathen be here, I am perfectly confident, and
bring forward my proofs, and will instruct him. How (you say)?</p>
<p>Christ foretold many things. If those former things did not come to pass, then do not
believe them; but if they all came to pass, why doubt concerning those that remain? And
indeed, it were very unreasonable,3193 nothing having come to pass, to believe the one, or
when all has come to pass, to disbelieve the others.</p>
<p>But I will make the matter more plain by an example. Christ said, that Jerusalem should
be taken, and should be so taken as no city ever was before, and that it should never be raised
up: and in fact this prediction came to pass. He said, that there should be “great tribulation”
( Matt. xxiv. 21 ), and it came to pass. He said that a grain of mustard seed is sown, so should
the preaching [of the Gospel] be extended: and every day we see this running over the world.
He said, that they who left father or mother, or brethren, or sisters, should have both fathers
and mothers; And this we see fulfilled by facts. He said, “in the world ye shall have tribulation,
but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” ( John xvi. 33 ), that is, no man shall get
the better of you. And this we see by the events has come to pass. He said that “the gates of
hell shall not prevail against the Church” ( Matt. xvi. 18 ), even though persecuted, and that
no one shall quench the preaching <del>of the Gospel</del>: and the experience of events bears witness
to this prediction also: and yet when He said these things, it was very hard to believe Him.
Why? Because all these were words, and He had not as yet given proof of the things spoken.
So that they have now become far more credible. He said that “when the Gospel should have
been preached among all the nations, then the end shall come” ( Matt. xxiv. 14 ); lo! now
ye have arrived at the end: for the greater part of the world hath been preached to, therefore
the end is now at hand. Let us tremble, beloved.</p>

<p><del>6.</del> But what, tell me? Art thou anxious about the end? It indeed is itself near, but each
man’s life and death is nearer.3194 For it is said, “the days of our years are seventy years; but
if <del>one be</del> in strength, fourscore years.” ( Ps. xc. 10 ; <del>LXX. lxxxix. 10</del>.) The day of judgment
is near. Let us fear. “A brother doth not redeem; shall man redeem?” ( Ps. xlix. 7 ; <del>LXX.
xlviii. 8</del>.) There we shall repent much, “but in death no man shall praise Him.” ( Ps. vi. 5 ;
<del>LXX. 6</del>.) Wherefore he saith, “Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving” ( Ps.
xcv. 2 ; <del>LXX. Ps. xciv.</del>), that is, his coming. For here <del>in this life</del> indeed, whatever we do
has efficacy; but there, no longer. Tell me, if a man placed us for a little while in a flaming
furnace, should we not submit to anything in order to escape, even were it necessary to part
with our money, nay to undergo slavery? How many have fallen into grievous diseases, and
would gladly give up all, to be delivered from them, if the choice were offered them? If in
this world then, a disease of short duration so afflicts us, what shall we do yonder, when
repentance will be of no avail?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Of how many evils are we now full, without being conscious of them? We bite one
another, we devour one another, in wronging, accusing, calumniating, being vexed by the
credit of our neighbors. (Cf. Gal. v. 15.)</p>
<p>And see the difficulty.3195 When a man wishes to undermine the reputation of a
neighbor, he says, ‘Such an one said this of him; O God, forgive me, do not examine me
strictly, I must give account of what I have heard.’3196 Why then dost thou speak of it at all,
if thou dost not believe it? Why dost thou speak of it? Why dost thou make it credible by
much reporting? Why dost thou pass on the story which is not true? Thou dost not believe
it, and thou entreatest God not to call thee to strict account? Do not say it then, but keep
silence, and free thyself from all fear.</p>
<p>But I know not from whence this disease has fallen upon men. We have become tattlers,
nothing remains3197 in our mind. Hear the exhortation of a wise man who says, “Hast thou
heard a word? Let it die in3198 thee, be bold; it will not burst thee.” ( Ecclus. xix. 10.) And
again, “A fool heareth a word, and travaileth, as a women in labor of a child.” ( Ecclus. xix.
11.) We are ready to make accusations, prepared for condemning. Even if no other evil thing
had been done by us, this were sufficient to ruin us, and to carry us away to Hell, this involves
us in ten thousand evils. And that thou mayest know this certainly, hear what the prophet
says, “Thou satest and spakest against thy brother.” ( Ps. l. 20.)</p>

<p>And see what great evils which arise from this. Thou provokest the wrath of God. Dost
thou not hear Paul saying about widows, “they not only” (these are his words) “learn to be
idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, wandering about from house to house, and speaking
things which they ought not.” ( 1 Tim. v. 13.) So that even when thou believest the things
which are said against thy brother, thou oughtest not even in that case to speak of them;
much less, when thou dost not believe them.</p>
<p>But thou <del>forsooth</del> lookest to thine own interest? Thou fearest to be called to account
by God? Fear then, lest even for thy tattling thou be called to account. For here, thou canst
not say, ‘O God, call me not to account for light talking’: for the whole matter is light talking.
Why didst thou publish it? Why didst thou increase the evil? This is sufficient to destroy
us. On this account Christ said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” ( Matt. vii. 1.)</p>
<p>But we pay no regard to this, neither are we brought to our senses by what happened
to the Pharisee. He said what was true, “I am not as this Publican” ( Luke xviii. 11 ), he said
it too in no man’s hearing; yet was he condemned. If he were condemned when he said what
was true, and uttered it in no man’s hearing, what fearful <del>punishment</del> shall not they suffer,
who like gossiping women, carry about everywhere lies which they do not even themselves
believe? What shall they not endure?</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Henceforward let us set “a door and a bolt before the mouth.” ( Ecclus. xxviii. 25.)
For innumerable evils have arisen from tattling; families have been ruined, friendships torn
asunder, innumerable other miseries have happened. Busy not thyself, O man, about the
affairs of thy neighbor.</p>
<p>But thou art talkative and hast a weakness. Talk of thine own <del>faults</del> to God: thus the
weakness will be no longer a weakness, but an advantage. Talk of thy own <del>faults</del> to thy
friends, those who are thorough friends and righteous men, and in whom thou hast confidence,
that so they may pray for thy sins. If thou speak of the <del>sins</del> of others, thou art nowise
profited, neither hast thou gained anything, but hast ruined thyself. If thou confessest thy
own <del>sins</del> to the Lord, thou hast great reward: for one says, “I said, I will confess against
myself mine iniquity to the Lord, and Thou forgavest the impiety of my heart.” ( Ps. xxxii.
5.)</p>
<p>Dost thou wish to judge? Judge thine own <del>sins</del>. No one will accuse3199 thee, if thou
condemn thyself: but he will accuse if thou do not condemn; he will accuse thee, unless thou
<note type="footnote">3199 ἐ γκαλεῖ</note>

<pb n="871"/>
convict thyself; will accuse thee of insensibility. Thou hast seen such an one angry, irritated,
doing something else out of place? Think at once, even thou on thy own <del>faults</del>: and thus
thou wilt not greatly condemn him, and wilt free thyself from the load of thy past transgressions.
If we thus regulate our own conduct, if we thus manage our own life, if we condemn
ourselves, we shall probably not commit many sins, and we shall do many good things, being
fair and moderate; and shall enjoy all the promises to them that love God: to which may all
attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever and world with end.
Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXII.</head>
<p>Hebrews xi. 3, 4</p>
<p>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things
which are seen were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God
a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness3200 that he was righteous,
God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.”3201</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Faith3202 needs a generous and vigorous soul, and one rising above all things of
sense, and passing beyond the weakness of human reasonings. For it is not possible to become
a believer, otherwise than by raising one’s self above the common customs <del>of the world</del>.</p>
<p>Inasmuch then as the souls of the Hebrews were thoroughly weakened, and though they
had begun from faith, yet from circumstances, I mean sufferings, afflictions, they had afterwards
become faint-hearted, and of little spirit, and were shaken from <del>their position</del>, he
encouraged them first indeed from these very things, saying, “Call to remembrance the
former days” ( c. x. 32 ); next from the Scripture saying, “But the just shall live by faith” ( c.
x. 38 ); afterwards from arguments, saying, “But Faith is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.” ( c. xi. 1.) And now again from their forefathers, those great
and admirable men, as much as saying; If where the good things were close at hand, all were
saved by faith, much more are we.</p>
<p>For when a soul finds one that shares the same sufferings with itself, it is refreshed and
recovers breath. This we may see both in the case of Faith, and in the case of affliction: “that
there may be comfort for you3203 it is said through our mutual faith.” ( Rom. i. 12.) For
mankind are very distrustful, and cannot place confidence in themselves, are fearful about
whatever things they think they possess, and have great regard for the opinion of the many.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What then does Paul do? He encourages them by the fathers; and before that by the
common notions <del>of mankind</del>.3204 For tell me, he says, since Faith is calumniated3205 as
being a thing without demonstration3206 and rather a matter of deceit, therefore he shows
<note type="footnote">3200 “was testified of.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3201 λαλεῖ, with the most approved mss. of the Epistle; the editions have λαλεῖται ; which is the reading of
the common texts of the N.T.</note>

<pb n="873"/>
that the greatest things are attained through faith and not through reasonings. And how
does he show this, tell me?3207 It is manifest, he saith, that God made the things which are,
out of things which are not,3208 things which appear, out of things which appear not, things
which subsist, out of things which subsist not. But whence <del>is it shown</del> that He did this
even “by a Word”? For reason suggests nothing of this kind; but on the contrary, that the
things which appear are <del>formed</del> out of things which appear.</p>
<p>Therefore the philosophers expressly say that ‘nothing comes out of things that are
not’3209 being “sensual” ( Jude 19 ), and trusting nothing to Faith. And yet these same men,
when they happen to say anything great and noble, are caught entrusting it to Faith. For
instance, that “God is without beginning,3210 and unborn”3211 ; for reason does not suggest
this, but the contrary. And consider, I beseech you, their great folly. They say3212 that God
is without beginning; and yet this is far more wonderful than the <del>creation</del> out of things
that are not. For to say, that He is without beginning, that He is unborn, neither begotten
by Himself nor by another is more full of difficulties,3213 than to say that God made the
things which are, out of things which are not. For here there are many things uncertain: as,
that some one made it, that what was made had a beginning, that, in a word, it was made.
But in the other case, what? He is self-existing,3214 unborn, He neither had beginning nor
time; tell me, do not these things require faith? But he did not assert this, which was far
greater, but the lesser.</p>
<p>Whence <del>does it appear</del>, he would say, that God made these things? Reason does not
suggest it; no one was present when it was done. Whence is it shown? It is plainly the result
of faith. “Through faith we understand that the worlds were made.” Why “through faith”?
Because “the things that are seen were not made of things which do appear.” For this is
Faith.</p>

<p><del>3.</del> Having thus stated the general <del>princi ple</del>,3215 he afterwards tests3216 it by individuals.
For a man of note is equivalent to the world. This at all events he afterwards hinted.
For when he had matched it against one or two hundred persons, and then saw the smallness
of the number, he afterwards says, “by whom the world was outweighed in worth.”3217 ( c.
xi. 38.)</p>
<p>And observe whom he puts first, him who was ill-treated, and that by a brother. It was
their own affliction,3218 “For you also” (he says) “have suffered like things of your own
countrymen.” ( 1 Thess. ii. 14.) And by a brother who had been nothing wronged, but who
envied him on God’s account; showing that they also are looked on with an evil eye and
envied. He honored God, and died because he honored Him: and has not yet attained to a
resurrection. But his readiness is manifest, and his part3219 has been done, but God’s part
has not yet been carried out towards him.</p>
<p>And by a “more excellent sacrifice” in this place, he means that which is more honorable,
more splendid, more necessary.</p>
<p>And we cannot say (he says) that it was not accepted. He did accept it, and said unto
Cain, <del>“Hast thou</del> not <del>sinned</del>, if thou rightly offer, but dost not rightly divide?” ( Gen. iv.
7 , LXX.) So then Abel both rightly offered, and rightly divided. Nevertheless for this, what
recompense did he receive? He was slain by his brother’s hand: and that sentence which his
father endured on account of sin, this he first received who was upright. And he suffered
so much the more grievously because it was from a brother, and he was the first <del>to suffer</del>.</p>
<p>And he did these things rightly looking to no man. For to whom could he look, when
he so honored God? To his father and his mother? But they had outraged Him in return for
His benefits. To his brother then? But he also had dishonored <del>God</del>. So that by himself he
sought out what was good.</p>
<p>And he that is worthy of so great honor, what does he suffer? He is put to death. And
how too was he otherwise “testified of that he was righteous”? It is said, that fire came down
and consumed the sacrifices. For instead of <del>“And the Lord</del> had respect to Abel and to his
sacrifices” ( Gen. iv. 4 ), the Syriac3220 said, “And He set them on fire.” He therefore who

both by word and deed bare witness to the righteous man and sees him slain for His sake,
did not avenge him, but left him to suffer.</p>
<p>But your case is not such: for how could it be? You who have both prophets and examples,
and encouragements innumerable, and signs and miracles accomplished? Hence that was
faith indeed. For what miracles did he see, that he might believe he should have any recompense
of good things? Did he not choose virtue from Faith alone?</p>
<p>What is, “and by it he being dead yet speaketh”? That he might not cast them into great
despondency, he shows that he has in part obtained a recompense. How? ‘The influence
coming from him3221 is great, he means, “and he yet speaketh”; that is, <del>Cain</del> slew him,
but he did not with him slay his glory and memory. He is not dead; therefore neither shall
ye die. For by how much the more grievous a man’s sufferings are, so much the greater is
his glory.’</p>
<p>How does he “yet speak”? This is a sign both of his being alive, and of his being by all
celebrated, admired, counted blessed. For he who encourages others to be righteous, speaks.
For no speech avails so much, as that man’s suffering. As then heaven by its mere appearance
speaks, so also does he by being had in remembrance. Not if he had made proclamation of
himself, not if he had ten thousand tongues, and were alive, would he have been so admired
as now. That is, these things do not take place with impunity, nor lightly, neither do they
pass away.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> ( Ver. 5 ) “By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not
found, because God had translated him.” This man displayed greater faith than Abel. How
(you ask)? Because, although be came after him, yet what befell <del>Abel</del> was sufficient to
guide him back.3222 How? God foreknew that <del>Abel</del> would be killed. For He said to Cain:
“Thou hast sinned: do not add thereto.”3223 Honored by him, He did not protect him. And
<note type="footnote">we should read, ὁ Σύρος, καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν, εἶπεν The Hebrew words are וישע יהוה , which (not the Syriac
translator, but) Theodotion renders καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν ὁ Θεός, ‘And God set [them] on fire,’ as may be seen in our
edition of the Hexapla, and is proved by Jerome’s testimony on the passage. For the Syriac translation is, ‘and
God was well pleased.’ So perhaps it might be an error of Chrysostom.” Four of the six mss. mentioned by Mr.
Field [but not the Catena] have Σύρος. [Field’s mss. A and O have κύριος.—F.G.]</note>

yet neither did this throw him <del>Enoch</del> into indifference. He said not to himself, ‘What need
of toils and dangers? Abel honored God, yet He did not protect him. For what advantage
had he that was departed, from the punishment of his brother? And what benefit could he
reap therefrom? Let us allow that he suffers severe punishment: what is that to him who has
been slain?’ He neither said nor thought anything of this kind, but passing beyond all these
things, he knew that if there is a God, certainly there is a Rewarder also: although as yet they
knew nothing of a resurrection. But if they who as yet know nothing of a resurrection, and
see contradictory things here, thus pleased <del>God</del>, how much more should we? For they
neither knew of a resurrection, nor had they any examples to look to. This same thing then
made <del>Enoch</del> well-pleasing <del>to God</del>, namely, that he received nothing. For he knew that
<del>God</del> “is a rewarder.” Whence <del>knew he this</del>“For He recompensed Abel,” do you say?
So that reason suggested other things, but faith the opposite of what was seen. Even then
(he would say) if you see that you receive nothing here, be not troubled.</p>
<p>How was it “by faith” that “Enoch was translated”? Because his pleasing <del>God</del> was the
cause of his translation, and faith <del>the cause</del> of his pleasing <del>Him</del>. For if he had not known
that he should receive a reward, how could he have pleased <del>Him</del>? “But without faith it is
impossible to please” Him. How? If a man believe that there is a God and a retribution, he
will have the reward. Whence then is the well-pleasing?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> It is necessary to “believe that He is,” not ‘what He is.’3224 If “that He is” needs Faith,
and not reasonings; it is impossible to comprehend by reasoning ‘what He is.’ If that “He is
a rewarder” needs Faith and not reasonings, how is it possible by Reasoning to compass His
essence?3225 For what Reasoning can reach this? For some persons say that the things that
exist are self-caused.3226 Seest thou that unless we have Faith in regard to all things, not
only in regard to retribution, but also in regard to the very being of God, all is lost to us?</p>
<p>But many ask whither Enoch was translated, and why he was translated, and why he
did not die, neither he nor Elijah, and, if they are still alive, how they live, and in what form.
But to ask these things is superfluous. For that the one was translated, and that the other
was taken up, the Scriptures have said; but where they are, and how they are, they have not
added: For they say nothing more than is necessary. For this indeed took place, I mean his
translation, immediately at the beginning, the human soul <del>thereby</del> receiving a hope of the

he killed his brother.</note>

can it be ascertained by reasonings.</note>

destruction of death, and of the overthrow of the devil’s tyranny, and that death will be done
away; for he was translated, not dead, but “that he should not see death.”</p>
<p>Therefore he added, he was translated alive, because he was well-pleasing [unto God].
For just as a Father when he has threatened his son, wishes indeed immediately after he has
threatened, to relax his threat, but endures and continues resolute, that for a time he may
chasten and correct him, allowing the threat to remain firm; so also God, to speak as it were
after the manner of men, did not continue resolute, but immediately showed that death is
done away. And first He allows death to happen, wishing to terrify the father through the
son: For wishing to show that the sentence is verily fixed, He subjected to this punishment
not wicked men at once, but him even who was well-pleasing, I mean, the blessed Abel; and
almost immediately after him, He translated Enoch. Moreover, He did not raise the former,
lest they should immediately grow bold; but He translated the other being yet alive: having
excited fear by Abel, but by this latter giving zeal to be well-pleasing unto Him. Wherefore
they who say that all things are ruled and governed of themselves,3227 and do not expect a
reward, are not well-pleasing; as neither are the heathen. For “He becomes a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him” by works and by knowledge.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Since then we have “a rewarder,” let us do all things that we may not be deprived
of the rewards of virtue. For indeed the neglecting such a recompense, the scorning such a
reward, is worthy of many tears. For as to “those who diligently seek Him,” He is a rewarder,
so to those who seek Him not, the contrary.</p>
<p>“Seek” (He says) “and ye shall find” ( Matt. vii. 7 ): but how can we find the Lord?
Consider how gold is found; with much labor. <del>“I sought the Lord</del> with my hands” (it is
said) “by night before Him, and I was not deceived” ( Ps. lxxvii. 2. See LXX [Ps. lxxvi. 3]),
that is, just as we seek what is lost, so let us seek God. Do we not concentrate our mind
thereon? Do we not enquire of every one? Do we not travel from home? Do we not promise
money?</p>
<p>For instance, suppose that any among us has lost his son, what do we not do? What
land, what sea do we not make the circuit of? Do we not reckon money, and houses, and
everything else as secondary to the finding him? And should we find him, we cling to him,
we hold him fast, we do not let him go. And when we are going to seek anything whatever,
we busy ourselves in all ways to find what is sought. How much more ought we to do this
in regard to God, as seeking what is indispensable; nay rather, not in the same way, but
much more! But since we are weak, at least seek God as thou seekest thy money or thy son.
Wilt thou not leave thy home for Him? Hast thou never left thy home for money? Dost thou
not busy thyself in all ways? When thou hast found <del>it</del>, art thou not full of confidence?</p>
<note type="footnote">3227 αὐτόματα</note>

<pb n="878"/>
<p><del>7.</del> “Seek” (He says) “and ye shall find.” For things sought after need much care, especially
in regard of God. For many are the hindrances, many the things that darken, many
that impede our perception. For as the sun is manifest, and set forth publicly before all, and
we have no need to seek it; but if on the other hand we bury ourselves and turn everything
upside down, we need much labor to look at the sun; so truly here also, if we bury ourselves
in the depth of evil desires, in the darkness of passions and of the affairs of this life, with
difficulty do we look up, with difficulty do we raise our heads, with difficulty do we see
clearly. He that is buried underground, in whatever degree he sees upwards, in that degree
does he come towards the sun. Let us therefore shake off the earth, let us break through the
mist which lies upon us. It is thick, and close, and does not allow us to see clearly.</p>
<p>And how, you say, is this cloud broken through? If we draw to ourselves the beams of
“the sun of righteousness.” “The lifting up of my hands” (it is said) “is an evening sacrifice.”
( Ps. cxli. 2.) With our hands let us also lift up our mind: ye who have been initiated know
what I mean,3228 perhaps too ye recognize the expression, and see at a glance what I have
hinted at. Let us raise up our thoughts on high.</p>
<p>I myself know many men almost suspended apart from the earth, and beyond measure
stretching up their hands, and out of heart because it is not possible to be lifted into the air,
and thus praying with earnestness. Thus I would have you always, and if not always, at least
very often; and if not very often, at least now and then, at least in the morning, at least in
the evening prayers.3229 For, tell me, canst thou not stretch forth the hands? Stretch forth
the will, stretch forth as far as thou wilt, yea even to heaven itself. Even shouldst thou wish
to touch the very summit, even if thou wouldst ascend higher and walk thereon, it is open
to thee. For our mind is lighter, and higher than any winged creature. And when it receives
grace from the Spirit, O! how swift is it! How quick is it! How does it compass all things!
How does it never sink down or fall to the ground! These wings let us provide for ourselves:
by means of them shall we be able to fly even across the tempestuous sea of this present life.
The swiftest birds fly unhurt over mountains, and woods, and seas, and rocks, in a brief
moment of time. Such also is the mind; when it is winged, when it is separated from the
things of this life, nothing can lay hold of it, it is higher than all things, even than the fiery
darts of the devil.</p>
<p>The devil is not so good a marksman, as to be able to reach this height; he sends forth
his darts indeed, for he is void of all shame, yet he does not hit the mark; the dart returns
to him without effect, and not without effect only, but it <del>falls</del> upon his own head. For what
is sent forth by him must of necessity strike <del>something</del>. As then, that which has been shot
out by men, either strikes the person against whom it is directed, or pierces bird, or fence,
<note type="footnote">3228 The words of the Liturgy which were said throughout the Church Catholic, “Lift up your hearts,” U+0026c. </note>
<note type="footnote">3229 ἐ ν ταῖς ἑωθιναῖς, ἐν ταῖς ἑσπεριναῖς</note>

<pb n="879"/>
or garment, or wood, or the mere air, so does the dart of the devil also. It must of necessity
strike; and if it strike not him that is shot at, it necessarily strikes him that shoots it. And we
may learn from many instances, that when we are not hit, without doubt he is hit himself.
For instance, he plotted against Job: he did not hit him, but was struck himself. He plotted
against Paul, he did not hit him, but was struck himself. If we watch, we may see this happening
everywhere. For even when he strikes, he is hit; much more then <del>when he does not
hit</del>.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Let us turn his weapons then against himself, and having armed and fortified
ourselves with the shield of faith, let us keep guard with steadfastness, so as to be impregnable.
Now the dart of the devil is evil concupiscence. Anger especially is a fire, a flame; it catches,
destroys, consumes; let us quench it, by longsuffering, by forbearance. For as red-hot iron
dipped into water, loses its fire, so an angry man filling in with a patient one does no harm
to the patient man, but rather benefits him, and is himself more thoroughly subdued.</p>
<p>For nothing is equal to longsuffering. Such a man is never insulted; but as bodies of
adamant are not wounded, so neither are such souls. For they are above the reach of the
darts. The longsuffering man is high, and so high as not to receive a wound from the shot.
When one is furious, laugh; but do not laugh openly, lest thou irritate him: but laugh mentally
on his account. For in the case of children, when they strike us passionately, as though forsooth
they were avenging themselves, we laugh. If then thou laugh, there will be as great
difference between thee and him, as between a child and a man: but if thou art furious thou
hast made thyself a child. For the angry are more senseless than children. If one look at a
furious child, does he not laugh at him? “The poor-spirited” (it is said) “is mightily simple.”
( Prov. xiv. 29.) The simple then is a child: and “he who is longsuffering” (it is said) “is
abundant in wisdom.” This “abundant wisdom” then let us follow after, that we may attain
to the good things promised us in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xi. 7</p>
<p>“By faith Noah, being warned of God3230 of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared
an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir
of the righteousness which is by Faith.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “By faith” (he says) “Noah being warned of God.” As the Son of God, speaking of
His own coming, said, “In the days of Noah they married and were given in marriage” (
Luke xvii. 26, 27 ), therefore the Apostle also recalled to their mind an appropriate image.
For the example of Enoch, was an example only of Faith; that of Noah, on the other hand,
of unbelief also. And this is a complete consolation and exhortation, when not only believers
are found approved, but also unbelievers suffer the opposite.</p>
<p>For what does he say? “By faith being warned of God.”3231 What is “being warned of
God”? It is, “It having been foretold to him.” But why is the expression “divine communication”
3232 ( Luke ii. 26 ) used? for in another place also it is said, “and it was communicated3233
to him by the Spirit,” and again, “and what saith the divine communication?”3234
( Rom. xi. 4.) Seest thou the equal dignity of the Spirit? For as God reveals,3235 so also does
the Holy Spirit. But why did he speak thus? The prophecy is called “a divine communication.”</p>
<p>“Of things not seen as yet,” he says, that is of the rain.</p>
<p>“Moved with fear, prepared an ark.” Reason indeed suggested nothing of this sort; For
“they were marrying and being given in marriage”; the air was clear, there were no signs <del>of
change</del>: but nevertheless he feared: “By faith” (he says) “Noah being warned of God of
things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house.”</p>
<p>How is it, “By the which he condemned the world”? He showed them to be worthy of
punishment, since they were not brought to their senses even by the preparation.</p>

<p>“And he became” (he says) “heir of the righteousness which is by Faith”: that is, by his
believing God he was shown to be righteous. For this is the <del>part</del> of a soul sincerely disposed
towards Him and judging nothing more reliable than His words, just as Unbelief is the very
contrary. Faith, it is manifest, works righteousness. For as we have been warned of God respecting
Hell, so was he also: and yet at that time he was laughed at; he was reviled and ridiculed;
but he regarded none of these things.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> ( Ver. 8, 9 ) “By faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he
should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not knowing whither he
went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles,
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.” <del>“By faith”</del>: for
(tell me) whom did he see to emulate? 3236 He had for father a Gentile, and an idolater; he
had heard no prophets; he knew not whither he was going. For as they of the Hebrews who
believed, looked to these <del>patriarchs</del> as having enjoyed blessings innumerable, he shows
that none of them obtained anything as yet; all are unrewarded; no one as yet received his
reward. “He” escaped from his country and his home, and “went out not knowing whither
he went.”</p>
<p>And what marvel, if he himself <del>were so</del>, when his seed also dwelt in this same way?
For seeing the promise disproved3237 (since He had said, “To thee will I give this land, and
to thy seed”— Gen. xii. 7; xiii. 15 ), he saw his son dwelling there; and again his grandson
saw himself dwelling in a land not his own; yet was he nowise troubled. For the affairs of
Abraham happened as we might have expected, since the promise was to be accomplished
afterwards in his family (although it is said even to himself, “To thee, and to thy seed,” not,
“to thee through thy seed,” but “to thee and to thy seed”): still neither he, nor Isaac, nor
Jacob, enjoyed the promise. For one of them served for hire, and the other was driven out:
and he himself even was failing3238 through fear: and while he took some things indeed in
war, others, unless he had had the aid of God, would have been destroyed. On this account
<del>the Apostle</del> says, “with the heirs of the same promise”; not himself alone, he means; but
the heirs also.</p>

Enoch, and he was not found, so that he did not see death,” does he say, “These all died in
Faith.” And again, after saying, “they not having obtained the promises,” he declares that
Noah had received a reward, “to the saving of his house,” and that Enoch had been “translated,”
and that Abel “yet speaks,” and that Abraham had gained a hold on the land, and
yet he says, “These all died in Faith, not having obtained the promises.” What then is <del>meant</del>?</p>
<p>It is necessary to solve the first <del>difficulty</del>, and then the second. “These all” (he says)
“died in faith.” The word “all” is used here not because all had died, but because with that
one exception “all these had died,” whom we know to be dead.</p>
<p>And the <del>statement</del> “not having obtained the promises,” is true: for surely the promise
to Noah was not to be this <del>which is here spoken of</del>. But further, of what kind of “promises”
is he speaking? For Isaac and Jacob received the promises of the land; but as to Noah and
Abel and Enoch, what kind of promises did they receive? Either then he is speaking concerning
these three; or if concerning those others also, the promise was not this, that Abel should
be admired, nor that Enoch should be translated, nor that Noah should be preserved;3240
but these things came to them for their virtue’s sake, and were a sort of foretaste of things
to come. For God from the beginning, knowing that the human race needs much condescension,
bestows on us not only the things in the world to come, but also those here; as for
instance, Christ said even to the disciples, “Whosoever hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters,
or father, or mother, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life.” ( Matt.
xix. 29.) And again, “Seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto
you.” ( Matt. vi. 33.) Seest thou that these things are given by Him in the way of addition,
that we might not faint?3241 For as the athletes have the benefit of careful attention, even
when engaged in the combat, but do not then enjoy entire ease, living under rules, yet afterwards
they enjoy it entire: so God also does not grant us here to partake of “entire” ease.
For even here He does give <del>some</del>.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> “But having seen them afar off,” he says,3242 “and embraced them.” Here he hints
at something mystical: that they received beforehand all the things which have been spoken
concerning things to come; concerning the resurrection, concerning the Kingdom of
Heaven, concerning the other things, which Christ proclaimed when He came, for these are
“the promises” of which he speaks. Either then he means this, or, that they did not indeed
<note type="footnote">3240 We must probably understand also, “nor that the Patriarchs should live in Canaan” : the argument seems
to require this; besides, in the statement of the difficulty, Abraham’s having “got a hold on the land” is mentioned
together with the blessings bestowed on Abel, Enoch, and Noah, as something already given them.</note>

receive them, but died in confidence respecting them, and they were <del>thus</del> confident through
Faith only.</p>
<p>“Having seen them afar off”: four generations before; for after so many <del>generations</del>,
they went up out of Egypt.</p>
<p>“And embraced them,” saith he, and were glad. They were so persuaded of them as even
to “embrace <del>or “salute”</del> them,” from the metaphor of persons on ship-board seeing from
afar the longed-for cities: which, before they enter them, they take and occupy by words of
greeting.</p>
<p>( Ver. 10 ) “For they looked” (he says) “for the3243 city which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God.” Seest thou that they received them in this sense, in their already
accepting them and being confident respecting them. If then to be confident is to receive,
it is in your power also to receive. For these, although they enjoyed not those <del>blessings</del>,
yet still saw them by their longing desire. Why now do these things happen? That we might
be put to shame, in that they indeed, when things on earth were promised them, regarded
them not, but sought the future “city”: whereas God again and again speaks to us of the
city3244 which is above, and yet we seek that which is here. He said to them, I will give you
the things of the present <del>world</del>. But when He saw, or rather, when they showed themselves
worthy of greater things, then He no longer suffers them to receive these, but those greater
ones; wishing to show us that they are worthy of greater things, being unwilling to be bound
to these. As if one should promise playthings to an intelligent child, not that he might receive
them, but by way of exhibiting his philosophy, when he asks for things more important. For
this is to show, that they held off from the land with so great earnestness, that they did not
even accept what was given. Wherefore their posterity receive it on this account, for themselves
were worthy of the land.</p>
<p>What is, “the city which hath foundations”? For are not these <del>which are visible</del>
“foundations”? In comparison of the other, they are not.</p>
<p>“Whose Builder and Maker is God.” O! What an encomium on that city!</p>

a woman. But possibly some one might say, How “by faith,” when she laughed? Nay, while
her laughter indeed was from unbelief, her fear <del>was</del> from Faith, for to say, “I laughed not”
( Gen. xviii. 15 ), arose from Faith. From this then it appears that when unbelief had been
cleared out, Faith came in its place.</p>

<p>“By faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed even when she was past age.”3245
What is, “to conceive seed”?3246 She who was become dead, who was barren, received power
for the retaining of seed, for conception. For her imperfection was two-fold; first from her
time of life for she was really old; secondly from nature, for she was barren.</p>
<p>( Ver. 12 ) “Wherefore even from one they” all “sprang, as the stars of the sky, and as
the sand which is by the sea-shore.” “Wherefore” (he says) “even from one they” all “sprang.”
Here he not only says that she bare <del>a child</del>, but that she also became mother of so many
as not even fruitful wombs <del>are mothers of</del>. “As the stars,” He says. How then is it that He
often numbers them, although He said, “As the stars of the heaven shall not be numbered,
so neither shall your seed”? ( Gen. xv. 5.) He either means the excess, or else <del>speaks of</del>
those who are continually being born. For is it possible, tell me, to number their forefathers
of one family as, such an one son of such an one, and such an one son of such an one? But
here such are the promises of God, so skillfully arranged are His undertakings.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> But if the things which He promised as additional, are so admirable, so beyond expectation,
so magnificent, what will those be, to which these are an addition, to which these
are somewhat over and above? What then can be more blessed than they who attain them?
What more wretched than those who miss them? For if a man when driven out from his
native country, is pitied by all; and when he has lost an inheritance is considered by all as
an object of compassion, with what tears ought he to be bewailed, who fails of Heaven, and
of the good things there stored up? Or rather, he is not even to be wept for: for one is wept
for, when he suffers something of which he is not himself the cause; but when of his own
choice he has entangled himself in evil, he is not worthy3247 of tears, but of wailings;3248 or
rather then of mourning;3249 since even our Lord Jesus Christ mourned and wept for Jerusalem,
impious as it was. Truly we are worthy of weepings innumerable, of wailings innumerable.
If the whole world should receive a voice, both stones, and wood, and trees, and
wild beasts, and birds, and fishes, and in a word, the whole world, if receiving a voice it
should bewail us who have failed of those good things, it would not bewail and lament
enough. For what language, what intellect, can represent that blessedness and virtue, that
pleasure, that glory, that happiness, that splendor? “What eye hath not seen, and ear hath
not heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man” ( 1 Cor. ii. 9 ), (he did not say,

that they simply surpass <del>what we imagine</del>; but none hath ever conceived) “the things which
God hath prepared for them that love Him.” For of what kind are those good things likely
to be, of which God is the Preparer and Establisher? For if immediately after He had made
us, when we had not yet done anything, He freely bestowed so great <del>favors</del>, Paradise, familiar
intercourse with Himself, promised us immortality, a life happy and freed from cares;
what will He not bestow on those who have labored and struggled so greatly, and endured
on His behalf? For us He spared not His Only Begotten, for us when we were enemies He
gave up His own Son to death; of what will He not count us worthy, having become His
friends? what will He not impart to us, having reconciled us to Himself?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> He both is abundantly and infinitely rich; and He desires and earnestly endeavors
to obtain our friendship; we do not thus earnestly endeavor. What am I saying, ‘do not
earnestly endeavor’? We do not wish to obtain the good things as He wishes it. And what
He has done shows that He wishes it more [than we]. For while, for our own sake, we with
difficulty think lightly of a little gold: He, for our sake, gave even the Son who was His own.
Let us make use of the love of God as we ought; let us reap the fruits of His friendship. For
“ye are My friends” (he says) “if ye do what I say to you.” ( John xv. 14.) How wonderful!
His enemies, who were at an infinite distance from Him, whom in all respects He excels by
an incomparable superiority, these He has made His friends and calls them friends. What
then should not one choose to suffer for the sake of this friendship? For the friendship of
men we often incur danger, but for that of God, we do not even give up money. Our <del>condition</del>
does indeed call for mourning, for mourning and tears and wailings, and loud lamentation
and beating of the breast. We have fallen from our hope, we are humbled from our
high estate, we have shown ourselves unworthy of the honor of God; even after His benefits
we are become unfeeling, and ungrateful. The devil has stripped us of all our good things.
We who were counted worthy to be sons; we His brethren and fellow-heirs are come to
differ nothing from His enemies that insult Him.</p>
<p>Henceforward, what consolation shall there be for us? He called us to Heaven, and we
have thrust ourselves down to hell. “Swearing and lying and stealing and adultery, are poured
out upon the earth.” ( Hos. iv. 2.) Some “mingle blood upon blood”; and others do deeds
worse than blood-shedding. Many of those that are wronged, many of those that are defrauded
prefer ten thousand deaths to the suffering such things: and except they had feared
God, would even have killed themselves, being so murderously disposed against themselves.
Are not these things then worse than blood-shedding?</p>
<p><del>8.</del> “Woe is me, my soul! For the godly man is perished from the earth, and there is
none upright among men” ( Mic. vii. 1, 2 , LXX.); let us also now cry out, first about our
own selves: but aid me in my lamentation.</p>
<p>Perhaps some are even disgusted and laugh. For this very cause ought we to make our
lamentations the more intense, because we are so mad and beside ourselves, that we do not

<pb n="886"/>
know that we are mad, but laugh at things for which we ought to groan. O man! “There is
wrath revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men” ( Rom. i.
18 ); “God will come manifestly: a fire will burn before Him, and round about Him will be
a mighty tempest.” ( Ps. l. 3.) “A fire will burn before Him, and consume His enemies on
every side.” ( Ps. xcvii. 3.) “The day of the Lord is as a burning oven.” ( Mal. iv. 1.) And no
man lays up these things in his mind, but these tremendous and fearful doctrines are more
despised than fables, and are trodden under foot. He that heareth,—there is no one: while
they who laugh and make sport are—all. What resource will there be for us? Whence shall
we find safety? “We are undone, we are utterly consumed” ( Num. xvii. 12 ), we are become
the laughingstock of our enemies, and a mockery for the heathen and the Demons. Now is
the devil greatly elated; he glories and is glad. The angels to whom we had been entrusted
are all ashamed and in sadness: there is no man to convert <del>you</del>: all means have been used
by us in vain, and we seem to you as idle talkers. It is seasonable even now to call on the
heaven, because there is no man that heareth; to take to witness the elements: “Hear, O
heaven! and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath spoken.” ( Isa. i. 2.)</p>
<p>Give a hand, stretch it forth, O ye who have not yet been overwhelmed, to them who
are undone through their drunkenness: ye that are whole to them that are sick, ye that are
sober-minded to them that are mad, that are giddily whirling round.</p>
<p>Let no man, I beseech you, prefer the favor of his friend to his salvation; and let violence
and rebuke look to one thing only,—his benefit. When one has been seized by a fever, even
slaves lay hold of their Masters. For when that is pressing on him, throwing his mind into
confusion, and a swarm of slaves are standing by, they recognize not the law of Master and
Servant, in the calamity of the Master.</p>
<p>Let us collect ourselves, I exhort you: there are daily wars, submersions <del>of towns</del>, destructions
innumerable all around us, and on every side the wrath of God is enclosing us as
in a net. And we, as though we were well-pleasing to Him, are in security. We all make our
hands ready for unjust gains, none for helping others: all for plundering, none for protecting:
each one is in earnest as to how he shall increase his possessions; no one as to how he shall
aid the needy: each one has much anxiety how he may add to his wealth; no one how he
may save his own soul. One fear possesses all, lest (you say) we should become poor; no
man is in anguish and trembling lest we should fall into hell. These things call for lamentations,
these call for accusation, these call for reprobation.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But I do not wish to speak of these things, but I am constrained by my grief. Forgive
me: I am forced by sorrow to utter many things, even those which I do not wish. I see that
our wound is grievous, that our calamity is beyond comfort, that woes have overtaken us
greater than the consolation. We are undone. “O that my head were waters and mine eyes
a fountain of tears” ( Jer. ix. 1 ), that I might lament. Let us weep, beloved, let us weep, let
us groan.</p>

<pb n="887"/>
<p>Possibly there may be some here who say, He talks to us of nothing but lamentation,
nothing but tears. It was not my wish, believe me, it was not my wish, but rather to go
through a course of commendations and praises: but now it is not the season for these.
Beloved, it is not lamenting which is grievous, but the doing things which call for lamentations.
Sorrow is not the thing to shrink from, but the committing things that call for sorrow.
Do not thou be punished, and I will not mourn. Do not die, and I will not weep. If the body
indeed lies dead, thou callest on all to grieve with thee, and thinkest those without sympathy
who do not mourn: And when the soul is perishing, dost thou tell us not to mourn?</p>
<p>But I cannot be a father, if I do not weep. I am a father full of affection. Hear how Paul
exclaims, “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again” ( Gal. iv. 19 ): what mother
in child-birth utters cries so bitter as he! Would that it were possible for thee to see the very
fire that is in my heart, and thou wouldest know, that I burn <del>with grief</del> more intense than
any woman, or gift that suffers untimely widowhood. She does not so mourn over her husband,
nor any father over his son, as I do over this multitude that is here with us.</p>
<p>I see no progress. Everything turns to calumnies and accusations. No man makes it his
business to please God; but (he says) ‘let us speak evil of such an one or such an one.’ ‘Such
an one is unfit to be among the Clergy.’ ‘Such an one does not lead a respectable life.’ When
we ought to be grieving for our own evils, we judge others, whereas we ought not to do this,
even when we are pure from sins. “For who maketh thee to differ” (he says) “and what hast
thou which thou didst not receive? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory, as
though thou hadst not received it?” ( 1 Cor. iv. 7.) “And thou, why dost thou judge thy
brother” ( Rom. xiv. 10 ), being thyself full of innumerable evils? When thou sayest, Such
an one is a bad man, and a spendthrift, and vicious, think of thyself, and examine strictly
thy own [condition], and thou wilt repent of what thou hast said. For there is no, no not
any, such powerful stimulus to virtue, as the recollecting of our sins.</p>
<p>If we turn over these two things in our minds, we shall be enabled to attain the promised
blessings, we shall be enabled to cleanse ourselves and wipe away <del>what is amiss</del>. Only let
us take serious thought sometime; let us be anxious about the matter, beloved. Let us grieve
here in reflection, that we may not grieve yonder in punishment, but may enjoy the everlasting
blessings, where “pain and sorrow and sighing are fled away” ( Isa. xxxv. 10 ), that we
may attain to the good things which surpass man’s understanding, in Christ Jesus our Lord,
for to Him is glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xi. 13–16</p>
<p>“These all died in faith,3250 not having received the promises, but having seen them afar
off,3251 and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth. For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if
they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly;
wherefore God is not ashamed3252 to be called their God, for He hath prepared for them
a city.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> The first virtue, yea the whole of virtue, is to be a stranger to this world, and a sojourner,
and to have nothing in common with things here, but to hang loose from them, as
from things strange to us; As those blessed disciples did, of whom he says, “They wandered
about in sheepskins, and in goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented:3253 of whom
the world was not worthy.” ( c. xi. 37, 38.)</p>
<p>They called themselves therefore “strangers”; but Paul said somewhat much beyond
this: for not merely did he call himself a stranger, but said that he was dead to the world,
and that the world was dead to him. “For the world” (he says) “has been crucified to me and
I to the world.” ( Gal. vi. 14.) But we, both citizens3254 and quite alive, busy ourselves about
everything here as citizens. And what righteous men were to the world, “strangers” and
“dead,” that we are to Heaven. And what they were to Heaven, alive and acting as citizens,
that we are to the world. Wherefore we are dead, because we have refused that which is truly
life, and have chosen this which is but for a time. Wherefore we have provoked God to
wrath, because when the enjoyments of Heaven have been set before us, we are not willing
to be separated from things on earth, but, like worms, we turn about from the earth to the
earth, and again from this to that;3255 and in short are not willing to look up even for a little
while, nor to withdraw ourselves from human affairs, but as if drowned in torpor and sleep
and drunkenness, we are stupefied with imaginations.</p>

<p><del>2.</del> And as those who are under the power of sweet sleep lie on their bed not only during
the night, but even when the morning has over-taken them, and bright day has come, and
are not ashamed to indulge in pleasure, and to make the season of business and activity a
time of slumber and indolence, so truly we also, when the day is drawing near, when the
night is far spent, or rather the day; for “work” (it is said) “while it is day” ( John ix. 4 );
when it is day we practice all that belongs to the night, sleeping, dreaming, indulging in
luxurious fancies; and the eyes of our understanding are closed as well as those of our body;
we speak amiss, we talk absurdly; even if a person inflict a deep wound upon us, if he carry
off all our substance, if he set the very house on fire, we are not so much as conscious of it.</p>
<p>Or rather, we do not even wait for others to do this, but we do it ourselves, piercing and
wounding ourselves every day, lying in unseemly fashion, and stripped bare of all credit, all
honor, neither ourselves concealing our shameful deeds, nor permitting others to do so, but
lying exposed to public shame, to the ridicule, the numberless jests of spectators and passersby.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Do ye not suppose that the wicked themselves laugh at those who are of like characters
to themselves, and condemn them? For since God has placed within us a tribunal which
cannot be bribed nor ever utterly destroyed, even though we come to the very lowest depth
of vice; therefore even the wicked themselves give sentence against themselves, and if one
call them that which they are, they are ashamed, they are angry, they say that it is an insult.
Thus they condemn what they do, even if not by their deeds, yet by their words, by their
conscience, nay rather even by their deeds. For when they carry on their practices out of
sight and secretly, they give the strongest proof of the opinion they hold concerning the
thing itself. For wickedness is so manifest, that all men are its accusers, even those who follow
after it, while such is the quality of virtue, that it is admired even by those who do not
emulate it. For even the fornicator will praise chastity, and the covetous will condemn injustice,
and the passionate will admire patience, and blame quarrelsomeness, and the wanton
<del>will blame</del> wantonness.</p>
<p>How then (you say) does he pursue these things? From excessive indolence, not because
he judges it good; otherwise he would not have been ashamed of the thing itself, nor would
he have denied it when another accused him. Nay many when caught, not enduring the
shame, have even hanged themselves. So strong is the witness within us in behalf of what is
good and becoming. Thus what is good is brighter than the sun, and the contrary more
unsightly than anything.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> The saints were “strangers and sojourners.” How and in what way? And where does
Abraham confess himself “a stranger and a sojourner”? Probably indeed he even himself
confessed it:3256 but David both confessed “I am a stranger” and what? “As all my fathers
<note type="footnote">3256 See Gen. xxiii. 4</note>

<pb n="890"/>
were.” ( Ps. xxxix. 12.) For they who dwell in tents, they who purchase even burial places
for money, evidently were in some sense strangers, as they had not even where to bury their
dead.</p>
<p>What then? Did they mean that they were “strangers” from the land that is in Palestine?
By no means: but in respect of the whole world: and with reason; for they saw therein none
of the things which they wished for, but everything foreign and strange. They indeed wished
to practice virtue: but here there was much wickedness, and things were quite foreign to
them. They had no friend, no familiar acquaintance, save only some few.</p>
<p>But how were they “strangers”? They had no care for things here. And this they showed
not by words, but by their deeds. In what way?</p>
<p>He said to Abraham, “Leave that which seems thy country and come to one that is foreign”:
And he did not cleave to his kindred, but gave it up as unconcernedly as if he were
about to leave a foreign land. He said to him, “Offer up thy son,” and he offered him up as
if he had no son; as if he had divested himself of his nature, so he offered him up. The wealth
which he had acquired was common to all passers-by, and this he accounted as nothing. He
yielded the first places to others: he threw himself into dangers; he suffered troubles innumerable.
He built no splendid houses, he enjoyed no luxuries, he had no care about dress,
which all are things of this world; but lived in all respects as belonging to the City yonder;
he showed hospitality, brotherly love, mercifulness, forbearance, contempt for wealth and
for present glory, and for all else.</p>
<p>And his son too was such as himself: when he was driven away, when war was made on
him, he yielded and gave way, as being in a foreign land. For foreigners, whatever they suffer,
endure it, as not being in their own country. Even when his wife was taken from him, he
endured this also as being in a strange land: and lived in all respects as one whose home was
above, showing sobermindedness and a well-ordered life.3257 For after he had begotten a
son, he had no more commerce with his wife, and it was when the flower of his youth had
passed that he married her, showing that he did it not from passion, but in subservience to
the promise of God.</p>
<p>And what did Jacob? Did he not seek bread only and raiment, which are asked for by
those who are truly strangers; by those that have come to great poverty? When he was
driven out, did he not as a stranger give place? Did he not serve for hire? Did he not suffer
afflictions innumerable, everywhere, as a stranger?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And these things (he says) they said, “seeking” their “own country.” Ah! how great
is the difference! They indeed were in travail-pains each day, wishing to be released from
this world, and to return to their country. But we, on the contrary, if a fever attack us, neglecting
everything, weeping like little children, are frightened at death.</p>
<note type="footnote">3257 σωφροσύνην κοσμιότητα</note>

<pb n="891"/>
<p>Not without reason we are thus affected. For since we do not live here like strangers,
nor as if hastening to our country, but are like persons that are going away to punishment,
therefore we grieve, because we have not used circumstances as we ought, but have turned
order upside down. Hence we grieve when we ought to rejoice: hence we shudder, like
murderers or robber chiefs, when they are going to be brought before the judgment-seat,
and are thinking over all the things they have done, and therefore are fearful and trembling.</p>
<p>They, however, were not such, but pressed on. And Paul even groaned; “And we” (he
says) “that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.” ( 2 Cor. v. 4.) Such were they
who were with Abraham; “strangers,” he says, they were in respect of the whole world, and
“they sought a country.”</p>
<p>What sort of “country” was this? Was it that which they had left? By no means. For what
hindered them if they wished, from returning again, and becoming citizens? but they sought
that which is in Heaven? Thus they desired their departure hence, and so they pleased God;
for “God was not ashamed to be called their God.”</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Ah! how great a dignity! He vouch-safed “to be called their God.” What dost thou
say? He is called the God of the earth, and the God of Heaven, and hast thou set it down as
a great thing that “He is not ashamed to be called their God”? Great and truly great this is,
and a proof of exceeding blessedness. How? Because He is called God of earth and of heaven
as also of the Gentiles: in that He created and formed them: but <del>God</del> of those holy men,
not in this sense, but as some true friend.</p>
<p>And I will make it plain to you by an example; as in the case of <del>slaves</del> in large households,
when any of those placed over the household are very highly esteemed, and manage
everything themselves, and can use great freedom towards their masters, the Master is called
after them, and one may find many so called. But what do I say? As we might say the God,
not of the Gentiles but of the world, so we might say “the God of Abraham.” But you do not
know how great a dignity this is, because we do not attain to it. For as now He is called the
Lord of all Christians, and yet the name goes beyond our deserts: consider the greatness if
He were called the God of one <del>person</del>! He who is called the God of the whole world is “not
ashamed to be called” the God of three men: and with good reason: for the saints would
turn the scale, I do not say against the world3258 but against ten thousand such. “For one
man who doeth the will of the Lord,3259 is better than ten thousand transgressors.” ( Ecclus.
xvi. 3.)</p>
<note type="footnote">3258 See on ver. 36, pp. 488 sqq.</note>
<note type="footnote">3259 Mr. Field observes that St. Chrys. repeatedly cites Ecclus. xvi. 3 , thus; and that while the Greek is simply,
“or one is better than a thousand,” the Syriac seems to have read ὅ τι κρείσσων εἱς ποιῶν θέλημα, U+0026c. So the
English version has “for one that is just. ”</note>

<pb n="892"/>
<p>Now that they called themselves “strangers” in this sense is manifest. But supposing
that they said they were “strangers” on account of the strange land, why did David also <del>call
himself a stranger</del>? Was not he a king? Was not he a prophet? Did he not spend his life in
his own country? Why then does he say, “I am a stranger and a sojourner”? ( Ps. xxxix. 12.)
How art thou a stranger? “As” (he says) “all my fathers were.” Seest thou that they too were
strangers? We have a country, he means, but not really our country. But how art thou thyself
a stranger? As to the earth. Therefore they also <del>were strangers</del> in respect of the earth: For
“as they were,” he says, so also am I; and as he, so they too.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us even now become strangers; that God may “not be ashamed of us to be called
our God.” For it is a shame to Him, when He is called the God of the wicked, and He also
is ashamed of them; as He is glorified when He is <del>called the God</del> of the good and the kind,
and of them that cultivate virtue. For if “we” decline to be called the masters of our wicked
slaves, and give them up; and should any one come to us and say, ‘such a one does innumerable
bad things, he is your slave, is he not?’ We immediately say, “by no means,” to get rid
of the disgrace: for a slave has a close relation to his master, and the discredit passes from
the one to the other.3260 —But they were so illustrious, so full of confidence, that not only
was He “not ashamed to be called” from them, but He even Himself says, “I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” ( Ex. iii. 6.)</p>
<p>Let us also, my beloved, become “strangers”; that God may “not be ashamed of us”; that
He may not be ashamed, and deliver us up to Hell. Such were they who said, “Lord, have
we not prophesied in Thy Name, and in Thy Name have done many wonderful works!” (
Matt. vii. 22.) But see what Christ says to them: “I know you not:” the very thing which
masters would do, when wicked slaves run to them, wishing to be rid of the disgrace. “I
know you not,” He says. How then dost Thou punish those whom Thou knowest not? I
said, “I know not,” in a different sense: that is, “I deny you, and renounce you.” But God
forbid that we should hear this fatal and terrible utterance. For if they who cast out demons
and prophesied, were denied, because their life was not suitable thereto; how much more
we!</p>
<p><del>8.</del> And how (you ask) is it possible that they should be denied, who have shown
prophetic powers, and wrought miracles, and cast out demons? Is it probable they were afterwards
changed, and became wicked; and therefore were nothing benefited, even by their
former virtue. For not only ought we to have our beginnings splendid, but the end also more
splendid still.</p>
<p>For tell me, does not the Orator take pains to make the end of his speech splendid, that
he may retire with applause? Does not the public officer make the most splendid display at
the close of his administration? The wrestler, if he do not make a more splendid display and
<note type="footnote">3260 The sentence is left incomplete: The common editions add, “much more does God.”</note>

<pb n="893"/>
conquer unto the end, and if after vanquishing all he be vanquished by the last, is not all
unprofitable to him? Should the pilot have crossed the whole ocean, yet if he wreck his
vessel at the port, has he not lost all his former labor? And what <del>of</del> the Physician? If, after
he has freed the sick man from his disease, when he is on the point of discharging him cured,
he should then destroy him, has he not destroyed everything? So too in respect of Virtue,
as many as have not added an end suitable to the beginning, and in unison and harmony
with it, are ruined, and undone. Such are they who have sprung forth from the starting place
bright and exulting, and afterwards have become faint and feeble. Therefore they are both
deprived of the prize, and are not acknowledged by their master.</p>
<p>Let us listen to these things, those of us who are in love of wealth: for this is the greatest
iniquity. “For the love of money is the root of all evil.” ( 1 Tim. vi. 10.) Let us listen, those
of us who wish to make our present possessions greater, let us listen and sometime cease
from our covetousness, that we may not hear the same things as they <del>will hear</del>. Let us
listen to them now, and be on our guard, that we may not hear them then. Let us listen now
with fear, that we may not then listen with vengeance: “Depart from Me” (He says); “I never
knew you” ( Matt. vii. 23 ), no not even then (He means) when ye made a display of
prophesyings, and were casting out demons.</p>
<p>It is probable that He also here hints at something else, that even then they were wicked;
and from the beginning, grace wrought even by the unworthy. For if it wrought through
Balaam, much more through the unworthy, for the sake of those who shall profit <del>by it</del>.</p>
<p>But if even signs and wonders did not avail to deliver from punishment; much more, if
a man happen to be in the priestly dignity:3261 even if he reach the highest honor, even if
grace work in him to ordination, even if unto all the other things, for the sake of those who
need his leadership,3262 he also shall hear, “I never knew thee,” no, not even then when
grace wrought in thee.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> O! how strict shall the search be there as to purity of life! How does that, of itself,
suffice to introduce us into the kingdom? While the absence of it gives up the man <del>to destruction</del>,
though he have ten thousand miracles and signs to show. For nothing is so
pleasing to God as an excellent course of life. “If ye love Me” ( John xiv. 15 ), He declares;
He did not say, “work miracles,” but what? “Keep My commandments.” And again, “I call
you friends” ( John xv. 14 ), not when ye cast out demons, but “if ye keep My words.” For
those things come of the gift of God: but these after the gift of God, of our own diligence
also. Let us strive to become friends of God, and not remain enemies to Him.</p>
<p>These things we are ever saying, these exhortations we are ever giving, both to ourselves
and to you: but nothing more is gained. Wherefore also I am afraid. And I would have
<note type="footnote">3261 ἀ ξιώματι ἱερατικῷ</note>
<note type="footnote">3262 τῆς προστασίας</note>

<pb n="894"/>
wished indeed to be silent, so as not to increase your danger. For when a person often hears,
and even so does not act, this is to provoke the Lord to anger. But I fear also myself that
other danger, that of silence, if when I am ap pointed to the ministering of the word, I
should hold my peace.</p>
<p>What shall we then do that we may be saved? Let us begin <del>the practice of</del> virtue, as we
have opportunity: let us portion out the virtues to ourselves, as laborers do their husbandry;
in this month let us master evil-speaking, injuriousness, unjust anger; and let us lay down
a law for ourselves, and say, To-day let us set this right. Again, in this month let us school
ourselves in forbearance, and in another, in some other virtue: And when we have got into
the habit of this virtue let us go to another, just as in the things we learn at school, guarding
what is already gained, and acquiring others.</p>
<p>After this let us proceed to contempt for riches. First let us restrain our hands from
grasping, and then let us give alms. Let us not simply confound everything, with the same
hands both slaying and showing mercy forsooth. After this, let us go to some other virtue,
and from that, to another. “Filthiness and foolish talking and jesting, let it not be even named
among you.” ( Eph. v. 4, 3.) Let us be thus far in the right way.</p>
<p>There is no need of spending money, there is no need of labor, none of sweat, it is enough
to have only the will, and all is done. There is no need to travel a long way, nor to cross a
boundless ocean, but to be in earnest and of ready mind, and to put a bridle on the tongue.
Unseasonable reproaches, anger, disorderly lusts, luxuriousness, expensiveness, let us cast
off; and the desire of wealth also from our soul, perjury and habitual oaths.</p>
<p>If we thus cultivate ourselves, plucking out the former thorns, and casting in the heavenly
seed, we shall be able to attain the good things promised. For the Husbandman will come
and will lay us up in His Garner, and we shall attain to all good things, which may we all
attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father
together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXV.</head>
<p>Hebrews xi. 17–19</p>
<p>“By faith <del>Abraham</del>,3263 when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the
promises offered up his only-begotten son, of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy
seed be called: accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; from
whence also he received him in a figure.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Great indeed was the faith of Abraham. For while in the case of Abel, and of Noah,
and of Enoch, there was an opposition of reasonings only, and it was necessary to go beyond
human reasonings; in this case it was necessary not only to go beyond human reasonings,
but to manifest also something more. For what was of God3264 seemed to be opposed to
what was of God; and faith opposed faith, and command promise.</p>
<p>I mean this: He had said, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and I will
give thee this land.” ( Gen. xii. 1, 7.) “He gave him none inheritance in it, no not so much
as to set his foot on.” ( Acts vii. 5.) Seest thou how what was done was opposed to the
promise? Again He said, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called” ( Gen. xxi. 12 ), and he believed:
and again He says, Sacrifice to Me this one, who was to fill all the world from his seed. Thou
seest the opposition between the commands and the promise? He enjoined things that were
in contradiction to the promises, and yet not even so did the righteous man stagger, nor say
he had been deceived.</p>
<p>For you indeed, he means, could not say this, that He promised ease and gave tribulation.
For in our case, the things which He promised, these also He performs. How so? “In the
world” (He says), “ye shall have tribulation.” ( John xvi. 33.) “He that taketh not his cross
and followeth Me, is not worthy of Me.” ( Matt. x. 38.) “He that hateth not his life shall not
find it.” ( John xii. 25 .) And, “He that forsaketh not all that he hath, and followeth after Me,
is not worthy of Me.” ( Luke xiv. 27, 33.) And again, “Ye shall be brought before rulers and
kings for My sake.” ( Matt. x. 18.) And again, “A man’s foes shall be they of his own household.”
( Matt. x. 36.) But the things which pertain to rest are yonder.</p>
<p>But with regard to Abraham, it was different. He was enjoined to do what was opposed
to the promises; and yet not even so was he troubled, nor did he stagger, nor think he had
been deceived. But you endure nothing except what was promised, yet you are troubled.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> He heard the opposite of the promises from Him who had made them; and yet he
was not disturbed, but did them as if they had been in harmony <del>therewith</del>. For they were
in harmony; being opposed indeed according to human calculations, but in harmony <del>when</del>
<note type="footnote">3263 Mr. Field’s text omits ̓ Αβραὰμ, and has δεξάμενος for ἀ ναδεξάμενος</note>
<note type="footnote">3264 τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, the acts and words of God.</note>

<pb n="896"/>
<del>viewed</del> by Faith. And how this was, the Apostle himself has taught us, by saying, “accounting3265
that God was able to raise Him up, even from the dead.” By the same faith (he means)
by which he believed that God gave what was not,3266 and raised up the dead, by the same
was he persuaded that He would also raise him up after he had been slain in sacrifice. For
it was alike impossible (to human calculation, I mean) from a womb which was dead and
grown old and already become useless for child-bearing to give a child, and to raise again
one who had been slain. But his previous faith prepared the way for things to come.</p>
<p>And see; the good things came first, and the hard things afterwards, in his old age. But
for you, on the contrary, (he says) the sad things are first, and the good things last. This for
those who dare to say, ‘He has promised us the good things after death; perhaps He has deceived
us.’ He shows that “God is able to raise up even from the dead,” and if God be able
to raise from the dead, without all doubt He will pay all <del>that He has promised</del>.</p>
<p>But if Abraham so many years before, believed “that God is able to raise from the dead,”
much more ought we to believe it. Thou seest (what I at first said) that death had not yet
entered in and yet He drew them at once to the hope of the resurrection, and led them to
such full assurance, that when bidden, they even slay their own sons, and readily offer up
those from whom they expected to people the world.</p>
<p>And he shows another thing too, by saying, that “God tempted Abraham.” ( Gen. xxii.
1.) What then? Did not God know that the man was noble and approved? Why then did He
tempt him? Not that He might Himself learn, but that He might show to others, and make
his fortitude manifest to all.3267 And here also he shows the cause of trials, that they may
not suppose they suffer these things as being forsaken <del>of God</del>. For in their case indeed, it
was necessary that they should he tried, because there were many who persecuted or plotted
against them: but in Abraham’s case, what need was there to devise trials for him which did
not exist? Now this trial, it is evident, was by His command. The others indeed happened
by His allowance, but this even by His command. If then temptations make men approved
in such wise that, even where there is no occasion, God exercises His own athletes; much
more ought we to bear all things nobly.</p>
<p>And here he said emphatically, “By faith, when he was tried, he offered up Isaac,” for
there was no other cause for his bringing the offering but that.</p>
<note type="footnote">3265 λογισάμενος. The cognate word λογισμὸς is used throughout for our “reasoning,” “calculation.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3266 οὐκ ὄντα ἐχαρίσατο, i.e. Isaac. See Rom. iv. 17 , “Before God, in whom he believed, who quickeneth the

see ib. ver. 19 , “He considered not his own body, now dead, nor yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb” : to which,
so to say, life was restored.</note>
<note type="footnote">3267 [See St. Cyr. Alex. Glaph. 87.]</note>

<pb n="897"/>
<p><del>3.</del> After this he pursues the same thought. No one (he says) could allege, that he had
another son, and expected the promise to be fulfilled from him, and therefore confidently
offered up this one. “And” (his words are) “he offered up his only-begotten, who had received
the promises.” Why sayest thou “only-begotten”? What then? Of whom was Ishmael sprung?
I mean “only-begotten” (he would say) so far as relates to the word of the promise. Therefore
after saying, “Only-begotten,” showing that he says it for this reason, he added, “of whom
it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” that is, “from” him. Seest thou how he admires
what was done by the Patriarch? “In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” and that son he brought
to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, that no one may suppose he does this in despair, and in consequence of
this command had cast away that Faith,3268 but may understand that this also was truly of
faith, he says that he retained that faith also, although it seem to be at variance with this.
But it was not at variance. For he did not measure the power of God by human reasonings,
but committed all to faith. And hence he was not afraid to say, that God was “able to raise
him up, even from the dead.”</p>
<p>“From whence also he received him in a figure,”3269 that is in idea,3270 by the ram, he
means. How? The ram having been slain, he was saved: so that by means of the ram he received
him again, having slain it in his stead. But these things were types: for here it is the
Son of God who is slain.</p>
<p>And observe, I beseech you, how great is His lovingkindness. For inasmuch as a great
favor was to be given to men, He, wishing to do this, not by favor, but as a debtor, arranges
that a man should first give up his own son on account of God’s command, in order that
He Himself might seem to be doing nothing great in giving up His own Son, since a man
had done this before Him; that He might be supposed to do it not of grace, but of debt. For
we wish to do this kindness also to those whom we love, others, to appear first to have re-
ceived some little thing from them, and so give them all: and we boast more of the receiving
than of the giving; and we do not say, We gave him this, but, We received this from him.</p>
<p>“From whence also” (are his words) “he received him in a figure,” i.e. as in a riddle3271
(for the ram was as it were a figure of Isaac) or, as in a type. For since the sacrifice had been
completed, and Isaac slain in purpose,3272 therefore He gave him to the Patriarch.</p>

<p><del>4.</del> Thou seest, that what I am constantly saying, is shown in this case also? When we
have proved that our mind is made perfect, and have shown that we disregard earthly things,
then earthly things also are given to us; but not before; lest being bound to them already,
receiving them we should be bound still. Loose thyself from thy slavery first (He says), and
then receive, that thou mayest receive no longer as a slave, but as a master. Despise riches,
and thou shalt be rich. Despise glory, and thou shalt be glorious. Despise the avenging thyself
on thine enemies, and then shalt thou attain it. Despise repose, and then thou shalt receive
it that in receiving thou mayest receive not as a prisoner, nor as a slave, but as a freeman.</p>
<p>For as in the case of little children, when the child eagerly desires childish playthings,
we hide them from him with much care, as a ball, for instance, and such like things, that he
may not be hindered from necessary things; but when he thinks little of them, and no longer
longs for them, we give them fearlessly, knowing that henceforth no harm can come to him
from them, the desire no longer having strength enough to draw him away from things necessary;
so God also, when He sees that we no longer eagerly desire the things of this world,
thenceforward permits us to use them. For we possess them as freemen and men, not as
children.</p>
<p>For <del>in proof</del> that if thou despise the avenging thyself on thine enemies, thou wilt then
attain it, hear what he says, “If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink,”
and he added, “for in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.” ( Rom. xii. 20.)
And again, that if thou despise riches, thou shalt then obtain them, hear Christ saying,
“There is no man which hath left father, or mother, or house, or brethren, who shall not
receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.” ( Matt. xix. 29.) And that if thou
despise glory, thou shalt then attain it, again hear Christ Himself saying, “He that will be
first among you, let him be your minister.” ( Matt. xx. 26.) And again, “For whosoever shall
humble himself, he shall be exalted.” ( Matt. xxiii. 12.)</p>
<p>What sayest thou? If I give drink to mine enemy, do I then punish him? If I give up my
goods, do I then possess them? If I humble myself, shall I then be exalted? Yea, He says, for
such is My power, to give contraries by means of contraries. I abound in resources and in
contrivances: be not afraid. The ‘Nature of things’ follows My will: not I attend upon Nature.
I do all things: I am not controlled by them: wherefore also I am able to change their form
and order.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And why dost thou wonder if <del>it is so</del> in these instances? For thou wilt find the
same also in all others. If thou injure, thou art injured;3273 if thou art injured, then thou art
uninjured; if thou punish, then thou hast not punished another, but hast punished thyself.
For “he that loveth iniquity,” it is said, “hateth his own soul.” ( Ps. xi. 5 , LXX.) Seest thou
<note type="footnote">3273 ἠ δικήθης</note>

<pb n="899"/>
that thou dost not injure, but art injured?3274 Therefore also Paul says, “Why do ye not
rather take wrong?” ( 1 Cor. vi. 7.) Dost thou see that this is not to be wronged?</p>
<p>When thou insultest, then art thou insulted. And most persons partly know this: as
when they say one to another, “Let us go away, do not disgrace yourself.” Why? Because the
difference is great between thee and him: for however much thou insultest him, he accounts
it a credit. Let us consider this in all cases, and be above insults. I will tell you how.</p>
<p>Should we have a contest with him who wears the purple, let us consider that in insulting
him, we insult ourselves, for we become worthy to be disgraced. Tell me, what dost thou
mean? When thou art a citizen of Heaven, and hast the Philosophy that is above, dost thou
disgrace thyself with him “that mindeth earthly things”? ( Philip. iii. 19.) For though he be
in possession of countless riches, though he be in power, he does not as yet know the good
that is therein. Do not in insulting him, insult thyself. Spare thyself, not him. Honor thyself,
not him. Is there not some Proverb such as this, He that honoreth;3275 honoreth himself?
With good reason: for he honors not the other, but himself. Hear what a certain wise man
says, “Do honor to thy soul according to the dignity thereof.” ( Ecclus. x. 28.) “According
to the dignity thereof,” what is this? if he have defrauded (it means), do not thou defraud;
if he has insulted, do not thou insult.</p>

wouldst thou for this have summoned a court of justice? Surely not. Why? Lest thou shouldst
disgrace thyself; lest all men should condemn thee. The same also happens in this case. For
the rich man is poor, and the more rich he is, the poorer is he in that which is indeed poverty.
Gold is clay, cast out in the yard, not lying in thy house, for thy house is Heaven. For this,
then, wilt thou summon a Court of Justice, and will not the citizens on high condemn thee?
Will they not cast thee out from their country, who art so mean, who art so shabby, as to
choose to fight for a little clay? For if the world were thine, and then some one had taken it,
oughtest thou to pay any attention to it?</p>
<p>Knowest thou not, that if thou wert to take the world ten times or an hundred times,
or ten thousand times, and twice that, it is not to be compared with the least of the good
things in Heaven? He then who admires the things here slights those yonder, since he judges
these worthy of exertion, though so far inferior to the other. Nay, rather indeed he will not

<p>How long shall we be stooping down? How long shall we plot one against another, like
wild beasts; like fishes? Nay rather, the wild beasts do not plot against each other, but <del>against</del>
animals of a different tribe. A bear for instance does not readily kill a bear, nor a serpent
kill a serpent, having respect for the sameness of race. But thou, with one of the same race,
and having innumerable claims,3276 as common origin, rational faculties, the knowledge
of God, ten thousand other things, the force of nature, him who is thy kinsman, and partaker
of the same nature—him thou killest, and involvest in evils innumerable. For what, if thou
dost not thrust thy sword, nor plunge thy right hand into his neck, other things more
grievous than this thou doest, when thou involvest him in innumerable evils. For if thou
hadst done the other, thou wouldst have freed him from anxiety, but now thou encompassest
him with hunger, with slavery, with feelings of discouragement, with many sins. These
things I say, and shall not cease to say, not <del>as</del> preparing you to commit murder: nor as
urging you to some crime short of that; but that you may not be confident, as if you were
not to give account. “For” (it says) “he that taketh away a livelihood” ( Ecclus. xxxiv. 22 )

also grasping, is polluted and unclean.</p>
<p>Let no one eat with such hands; for this is an insult to those invited. For, tell me, if a
man when he had made us lie down on tapestry3278 and a soft couch and linen interwoven
with gold, in a great and splendid house, and had set by us a great multitude of attendants,
and had prepared a tray3279 of silver and gold, and filled it with many dainties of great cost
and of all sorts, then urged us to eat, provided we would only endure his besmearing his
hands with mire or with human ordure, and so sitting down to meat with us—would any
man endure this infliction? Would he not rather have considered it an insult? Indeed I think
he would, and would have gone straightway off. But now in fact, thou seest not hands filled

with what is indeed filth, but even the very food, and yet thou dost not go off, nor flee, nor
find fault. Nay, if he be a person in authority, thou even accountest it a grand affair, and
destroyest thine own soul, in eating such things. For covetousness is worse than any mire;
for it pollutes, not the body but the soul, and makes it hard to be washed. Thou therefore,
though thou seest him that sitteth at meat defiled with this filth both on his hands and his
face, and his house filled with it, nay and his table also full of it (for dung, or if there be
anything more unclean than that, it is not so unclean and polluted as those viands), dost
thou feel as if forsooth thou wert highly honored, and as if thou wert going to enjoy thyself?</p>
<p>And dost thou not fear Paul who allows us to go without restraint to the Tables of the
heathen if we wish, but not even if we wish to those of the covetous? For, “if any man who
is called a Brother” ( 1 Cor. v. 11 ), he says, meaning here by Brother every one who is a
believer simply, not him who leads a solitary life. For what is it which makes brotherhood?
The Washing of regeneration; the being enabled to call God our Father. So that he that is a
Monk, if he be a Catechumen, is not a Brother,3280 but the believer though he be in the
world, is a Brother. “If any man,” saith he, “that is called a Brother.” ( 1 Cor. v. 11.) For at
that time there was not even a trace of any one leading a Monastic life, but this blessed
<del>Apostle</del> addressed all his discourse to persons in the world. “If any man,” he says, “that is
called a Brother, be a fornicator, or covetous or a drunkard, with such an one, no not to
eat.” But not so with respect to the heathen: but “If any of them that believe not,” meaning
the heathen, “bid you and ye be disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you eat.” ( 1 Cor.
x. 27.)</p>
<p><del>8.</del> “If any man that is called Brother be” (he says) “a drunkard.” Oh! what strictness!
Yet we not only do not avoid drunkards, but even go to their houses, partaking of what they
set before us.</p>
<p>Therefore all things are upside down, all things are in confusion, and overthrown, and
ruined. For tell me, if any such person should invite thee to a banquet, thee who art accounted
poor and mean, and then should hear thee say, “Inasmuch as the things set before me are
<del>the fruit</del> of overreaching, I will not endure to defile my own soul,” would he not be mortified?
Would he not be confounded? Would he not be ashamed? This alone were sufficient
to correct him, and to make him call himself wretched for his wealth, and admire thee for
thy poverty, if he saw himself with so great earnestness despised by thee.</p>
<note type="footnote">3280 It will be observed that the word πιστὸς, “believer,” means “one who believes and is baptized” : as opposed
to the unbaptized, even though they believed and were so religious as to devote themselves to an ascetic life.
Also, that at this time there were those who had given themselves up to an ascetic life and still deferred their
Baptism, see St. Greg. Naz. Hom. xl. 18. In the later form of the text, this clause has been altered to “So that a
Catechumen, even though he be a Monk, is not a brother.”</note>

<p>But we “are become” (I know not why) “servants of men” ( 1 Cor. vii. 23 ), though Paul
cries aloud throughout, “Be not ye the servants of men.” Whence then have we become
“servants of men”? Because we first became servants of the belly, and of money, and of glory,
and of all the rest; we gave up the liberty which Christ bestowed on us.</p>
<p>What then awaiteth him who is become a servant (tell me)? Hear Christ saying, “The
servant abideth not in the house for ever.” ( John viii. 35.) Thou hast a declaration complete
in itself, that he never entereth into the Kingdom; for this is what “the House” means. For,
He says, “in My Father’s House are many mansions.” ( John xiv. 2.) “The servant” then
“abideth not in the House for ever.” By a servant He means him who is “the servant of sin.”
But he that “abideth not in the House for ever,” abideth in Hell for ever, having no consolation
from any quarter.</p>
<p>Nay, to this point of wickedness are matters come, that they even give alms out of these
<del>ill-gotten gains</del>, and many receive <del>them</del>. Therefore our boldness has broken down, and
we are not able to rebuke any one. But however, henceforward at least, let us flee the mischief
arising from this; and ye who have rolled yourselves in this mire, cease from such defilement,
and restrain your rage for such banquets, if even now we may by any means be able to have
God propitious to us, and to attain to the good things which have been promised: which
may we all obtain in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy
Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xi. 20–22</p>
<p>“By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. By faith, Jacob when he
was a dying blessed both the sons of Joseph, and worshiped3281 leaning on the top of his
staff. By faith, Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel,
and gave commandment concerning his bones.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> “Many prophets and righteous men” (it is said) “have desired to see those things
which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear and have not
heard them.” ( Matt. xiii. 17.) Did then those righteous men know all the things to come?
Yea, most certainly. For if because of the weakness of those who were not able to receive
Him, the Son was not revealed,—He was with good reason revealed to those conspicuous
in virtue. This Paul also says, that they knew “the things to come,” that is the resurrection
of Christ.</p>
<p>Or he does not mean this: but that “By faith, concerning things to come” <del>means</del> not
<del>concerning</del> the world to come, but “concerning things to come” in this world. For how
<del>except by faith</del> could a man sojourning in a strange land, give such blessings?</p>
<p>But on the other hand he obtained the blessing, and yet did not receive it.3282 Thou
seest that what I said with regard to Abraham, may be said also of Jacob, that they did not
enjoy3283 the blessing, but the blessings went to his posterity, while he himself obtained the
“things to come.” For we find that his brother rather enjoyed the blessing. For <del>Jacob</del> spent
all his time in servitude and working as a hireling, and <del>amid</del> dangers, and plots, and deceits,
and fears; and when he was asked by Pharaoh, he says, “Few and evil have my days been” (
Gen. xlvii. 9 ); while the other lived in independence and great security, and afterwards was
an object of terror to [Jacob]. Where then did the blessings come to their accomplishment,
save in the <del>world</del> to come?</p>
<p>Seest thou that from the beginning the wicked have enjoyed things here, but the righteous
the contrary? Not however all. For behold, Abraham was a righteous man, and he enjoyed
things here as well, though with affliction and trials. For indeed wealth was all he had, seeing
all else relating to him was full of affliction. For it is impossible that the righteous man should
<note type="footnote">3281 or, “bowed himself, made obeisance.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3282 That is, Jacob obtained the blessing from Isaac, but did not himself receive the good things bestowed
by the blessing. Therefore the good things to come were not those of this world. This is a reply to the second,
the alternative, interpretation suggested.</note>
<note type="footnote">3283 ἀ πώναντο. This is the reading of the best mss. and the oldest translation. There seems no reason to
adopt the later reading ἀ πώνατο, “he did not enjoy.”</note>

<pb n="904"/>
not be afflicted, though he be rich: for when he is willing to be overreached, to be wronged,
to suffer all other things, he must be afflicted. So that although he enjoy wealth, <del>yet is it</del>
not without grief. Why? you ask. Because he is in affliction and distress. But if at that time
the righteous were in affliction, much more now.</p>
<p>“By Faith,” he says, “Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come” (and yet
Esau was the elder; but he puts Jacob first for his excellence). Seest thou how great was his
Faith? Whence did he promise to his sons so great blessings? Entirely from his having faith
in God.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “By Faith, Jacob when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph.” Here we
ought to set down the blessings entire, in order that both his faith and his prophesying may
be made manifest. “And worshiped leaning,”3284 he says, “upon the top of his staff.” Here,
he means, he not only spoke, but was even so confident about the future things, as to show
it also by his act. For inasmuch as another King was about to arise from Ephraim, therefore
it is said, “And he bowed himself upon the top of his staff.” That is, even though he was now
an old man, “he bowed himself” to Joseph, showing the obeisance of the whole people which
was to be <del>directed</del> to him. And this indeed had already taken place, when his brethren
“bowed down” to him: but it was afterwards to come to pass through the ten tribes. Seest
thou how he foretold the things which were to be afterwards? Seest thou how great faith
they had? How they believed “concerning the things to come”?</p>
<p>For some of the things here, the things present, are examples of patience only, and of
enduring ill-treatment, and of receiving nothing good; for instance, what is mentioned in
the case of Abraham, in the case of Abel. But others are <del>examples</del> of Faith, as in the case
of Noah, that there is a God, that there is a recompense. (For Faith in this place is manifold,
3285 both of there being a recompense, and of awaiting it, not under the same conditions,
3286 and of wrestling before the prizes.) And the things also which concern3287 Joseph
are of Faith only. Joseph heard that <del>God</del> had made a promise to Abraham, that He had
engaged His word “to thee and to thy seed will I give this land;” and though in a strange
land, and not yet seeing the engagement fulfilled, but never faltered even so, but so believed
as even to “speak of the Exodus, and to give commandment concerning his bones.” He then
not only believed himself, but led on the rest also to Faith: that having the Exodus always
in mind (for he would not have “given commandment concerning his bones,” unless he
had been fully assured <del>of this</del>), they might look for their return <del>to Canaan</del>.</p>
<note type="footnote">3284 προσεκύνησεν, as Gen. xlvii. 31. The same word also is used in the LXX. in Gen. xxxvii. 7, 9, 10 , of
Joseph’s dreams, where our version has “made obeisance” and “bow down ourselves.”</note>

<p>Wherefore, when some men say, ‘See! Even righteous men had care about their sepulchers,’
let us reply to them, that it was for his reason: for he knew that “the earth is the
Lord’s and all that therein is.”3288 ( Ps. xxiv. 1.) He could not indeed have been ignorant of
this, who lived in so great philosophy, who spent his whole life in Egypt. And yet if he had
wished, it was possible for him to return, and not to mourn or vex himself. But when he
had taken up his father thither, why, did he enjoin them to carry up thence his own bones
also? Evidently for this reason.</p>
<p>But what? Tell me, are not the bones of Moses himself laid in a strange land? And those
of Aaron, of Daniel, of Jeremiah? And as to those of the Apostles we do not know where
those of most of them are laid. For of Peter indeed, and Paul, and John, and Thomas, the
sepulchers are well known; but those of the rest, being so many, have nowhere become
known.3289 Let us not therefore lament at all about this, nor be so little-minded. For
whereever we may be buried, “the earth is the Lord’s and all that therein is.” ( Ps. xxiv. 1.)
Certainly what must take place, does take place: to mourn however, and lament, and bewail
the departed, arises from littleness of mind.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> ( Ver. 23 ) “By faith, Moses when he was born, was hid three months of his parents.”
Dost thou see that in this case they hoped for things on the earth after their death?3290 And
many things were fulfilled after their death. This is for some who say, ‘After death those
things were done for them, which they did not obtain while alive; nor did they believe <del>would
be</del> after their death.’</p>
<p>Moreover Joseph did not say, He gave not the land to me in my life-time, nor to my
father, nor to my grandfather, whose excellence too ought to have been reverenced; and will
He vouchsafe to these wretched people what He did not vouchsafe to them? He said nothing
of all this, but by Faith he both conquered and went beyond all these things.</p>
<p>He has named Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, all illustrious and admirable
men. Again he makes the encouragement greater, by bringing down the matter to ordinary
persons. For that the admirable should feel thus, is nothing wonderful, and to appear inferior
to them, is not so dreadful: but to show oneself inferior even to people without names, this
is the dreadful thing. And he begins with the parents of Moses, obscure persons, who had
nothing so great as their son [had]. Therefore also he goes on to increase the strangeness of
what he says by enumerating even women that were harlots, and widows. For “by Faith”
(he says) “the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received

the land of Canaan) would be given. In the next sentence St. Chrys. seems to return to the conduct of Joseph,

<pb n="906"/>
the spies with peace.” And he mentions the rewards not only of belief but also of unbelief;
as in <del>the case of</del> Noah.</p>
<p>But at present we must speak of the parents of Moses. Pharaoh gave orders that all the
male children should be destroyed, and none had escaped the danger. Whence did these
expect to save their child? From faith. What sort of Faith? “They saw” (he says) “that he was
a proper child.” The very sight drew them on to Faith: thus from the beginning, yea from
the very swaddling-clothes, great was the Grace that was poured out on that righteous man,
this being not the work of nature. For observe, the child immediately on its birth appears
fair and not disagreeable to the sight. Whose <del>work</del> was this? Not that of nature, but of the
Grace of God, which also stirred up and strengthened that barbarian woman, the Egyptian,
and took and drew her on.</p>
<p>And yet in truth Faith had not a sufficient foundation in their case. For what was it to
believe from sight? But you (he would say) believe from facts and have many pledges of
Faith. For “the receiving with joyfulness the spoiling of their goods” ( c. x. 34 ), and other
such <del>things</del>, were <del>evidences</del> of Faith and of Patience. But inasmuch as these <del>Hebrews</del>
also had believed, and yet afterwards had become faint-hearted, he shows that the Faith of
those <del>saints of old</del> also was long continued,3291 as, for instance, that of Abraham, although
the circumstances seemed to contend against it.</p>
<p>“And” (he says) “they were not afraid of the king’s commandment,” although that was
in operation,3292 but this <del>their hope respecting their child</del> was simply a kind of bare expectation.
And this indeed was <del>the act</del> of his parents; but Moses himself what did he contribute?</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Next again an example appropriate to them, or rather greater than that. For, saith
he, ( ver. 24–26 ) “by faith Moses when he was come to years, refused to be called the son
of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than
the treasures of Egypt;3293 for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.” As though
he had said to them, ‘No one of you has left a palace, yea a splendid palace, nor such treasures;
nor, when he might have been a king’s son, has he despised this, as Moses did.’ And that he
did not simply leave <del>these things</del>, he expressed by saying, “he refused,” that is, he hated,
he turned away. For when Heaven was set before him, it was superfluous to admire an
Egyptian Palace.</p>

<pb n="907"/>
<p>And see how admirably Paul has put it. He did not say, ‘Esteeming heaven, and the
things in heaven,’ ‘greater riches than the treasures of Egypt,’ but what? “The reproach of
Christ.” For the being reproached for the sake of Christ he accounted better than being thus
at ease; and this itself by itself was reward.</p>
<p>“Choosing rather” (he says) “to suffer affliction with the people of God.” For ye indeed
suffer on your own account, but he “chose” <del>to suffer</del> for others; and voluntarily threw
himself into so many dangers, when it was in his power both to live religiously, and to enjoy
good things.</p>
<p>“Than” (he says) “to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.” He called unwillingness
“to suffer affliction with the” rest “sin”: this, he says, <del>Moses</del> accounted to be “sin.” If then
he accounted it “sin” not to be ready to “suffer affliction with” the rest, it follows that the
suffering affliction must be a great good since he threw himself into it from the royal palace.</p>
<p>But this he did, seeing some great things before him. “Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.” What is, “the reproach of Christ”? It is being
reproached in such ways as ye are, the reproach which Christ endured; Or that he endured
for Christ’s sake: for “that rock was Christ”3294 ( 1 Cor. x. 4 ); the being reproached as you
are.</p>
<p>But what is “the reproach of Christ”? That <del>because</del> we repudiate the <del>ways</del> of our
fathers we are reproached; that we are evil-entreated when we have run to God. It was likely
that he also was reproached, when it was said to him, “Wilt thou kill me as thou killedst the
Egyptian yesterday?” ( Ex. ii. 14.) This is “the reproach of Christ,” to be ill-treated to the
end, and to the last breath: as He Himself was reproached and heard, “If Thou be the Son
of God” ( Matt. xxvii. 40 ), from those for whom He was crucified, from those who were of
the same race. This is “the reproach of Christ” when a man is reproached by those of his
own family, or by those whom he is benefiting. For <del>Moses</del> also suffered these things from
the man who had been benefited <del>by him</del>.</p>
<p>In these words he encouraged them, by showing that even Christ suffered these things,
and Moses also, two illustrious persons. So that this is rather “the reproach of Christ” than
of Moses inasmuch as He suffered these things from “His own.” ( John i. 11.) But neither
did the one send forth lightnings, nor the Other feel any <del>anger</del>,3295 but He was reviled
and endured all things, whilst they “wagged their heads.” ( Matt. xxvii. 39.) Since therefore
it was probable that they <del>the readers</del> also would hear such things, and would long for the
Recompense, he says that even Christ and Moses had suffered the like. So then ease3296 is
<note type="footnote">3294 The later mss. and common editions add some explanatory words, thus: “he suffered for Christ’s sake
when he was reviled in the matter of the rock, from which he brought out water: and ‘ that rock ’ (he says) ‘ was

<del>the portion</del> of sin; but to be reproached, of Christ. For what then dost thou wish? “The
reproach of Christ,” or ease?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> ( Ver. 27 ) “By faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured
as seeing Him who is Invisible.” What dost thou say? That he did not fear? And yet the
Scripture says, that when he heard, he “was afraid”3297 ( Ex. ii. 14 ), and for this cause
provided for safety by flight, and stole away, and secretly withdrew himself; and afterwards
he was exceedingly afraid. Observe the expressions with care: he said, “not fearing the wrath
of the king,” with reference to his even presenting himself again. For it would have been
<del>the part</del> of one who was afraid, not to undertake again his championship, nor to have any
hand in the matter. That he did however again undertake it, was <del>the part</del> of one who
committed all to God: for he did not say, ‘He is seeking me, and is busy <del>in the search</del>, and
I cannot bear again to engage in this matter.’</p>
<p>So that even flight was <del>an act of</del> faith. Why then did he not remain (you say)? That he
might not cast himself into a foreseen danger. For this finally would have been tempting
<del>God</del>: to leap into the midst of dangers, and say, ‘Let us see whether God will save me.’ And
this the devil said to Christ, “Cast Thyself down.” ( Matt. iv. 6.) Seest thou that it is a
diabolical thing, to throw ourselves into danger without cause and for no purpose, and to
try whether God will save us? For he <del>Moses</del> could no longer be their champion when they
who were receiving benefits were so ungrateful. It would therefore have been a foolish and
senseless thing to remain there. But all these things were done, because, “he endured as
seeing Him who is Invisible.”</p>
<p><del>6.</del> If then we too always see God with our mind, if we always think in remembrance
of Him, all things will appear endurable to us, all things tolerable; we shall bear them all
easily, we shall be above them all. For if a person seeing one whom he loves, or rather, remembering
him is roused in spirit, and elevated in thought, and bears all things easily, while
he delights in the remembrance; one who has in mind Him who has vouchsafed to love us
in deed, and remembers Him, when will he either feel anything painful, or dread anything
fearful or dangerous? When will he be of cowardly spirit? Never.</p>
<p>For all things appear to us difficult, because we do not have the remembrance of God
as we ought; because we do not carry Him about alway in our thoughts. For surely He might
justly say to us, “Thou hast forgotten Me, I also will forget thee.” And so the evil becomes
twofold, both that we forget Him and He us. For these two things are involved in each other,
yet are two. For great is the effect of God’s remembrance, and great also of His being re-

accomplish them, and bring them to their end.3298 Therefore the prophet says, “I will remember
Thee from the land of Jordan, and from the little hill of Hermon.” ( Ps. xlii. 6.) The
people which were in Babylon say this: being there, I will remember Thee.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Therefore let us also, as being in Babylon, <del>do the same</del>. For although we are not
sitting among warlike foes, yet we are among enemies. For some <del>of them</del> indeed were sitting
as captives, but others did not even feel their captivity, as Daniel, as the three children (cf.
Ps. cxxxvii. 1 ); who even while they were in captivity became in that very country more
glorious even than the king who had carried them captive. And he who had taken them
captive does obeisance to3299 the captives.</p>
<p>Dost thou see how great virtue is? When they were in actual captivity he waited on them
as masters. He therefore was the captive, rather than they. It would not have been so marvelous
if when they were in their native country, he had come and done them reverence in
their own land, or if they had been rulers there. But the marvelous thing is, that after he had
bound them, and taken them captive, and had them in his own country, he was not ashamed
to do them reverence in the sight of all, and to “offer an oblation.”3300 ( Dan. ii. 46.)</p>
<p>Do you see that the really splendid things are those which relate to God, whereas human
things are a shadow? He knew not, it seems, that he was leading away masters for himself,
and that he cast into the furnace those whom he was about to worship. But to them, these
things were as a dream.</p>
<p>Let us fear God, beloved, let us fear <del>Him</del>: even should we be in captivity, we are more
glorious than all men. Let the fear of God be present with us, and nothing will be grievous,
even though thou speak of poverty, or of disease, or of captivity, or of slavery, or of any
other grievous thing: Nay even these very things will themselves work together for us the
other way. These men were captives, and the king worshiped them: Paul was a tent-maker,
and they sacrificed to him as a God.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Here a question arises: Why, you ask, did the Apostles prevent the sacrifices, and
rend their clothes, and divert them from their attempt, and say with earnest lamentation,
“What are ye doing? we also are men of like passions with you” ( Acts xiv. 15 ); whereas
Daniel did nothing of this kind.</p>
<p>For that he also was humble, and referred <del>the</del> glory to God no less than they, is evident
from many places. Especially indeed is it evident, from the very fact of his being beloved by

God. For if he had appropriated to himself the honor belonging to God, He would not have
suffered him to live, much less to be in honor. Secondly, because even with great openness
he said, “And as to me, O King, this secret hath not been revealed to me through any wisdom
that is in me.” ( Dan. ii. 30.) And again; he was in the den for God’s sake, and when the
prophet brought him food, he saith, “For God hath remembered me.” ( Bel and the Dragon,
ver. 38.) Thus humble and contrite was he.</p>
<p>He was in the den for God’s sake, and yet he counted himself unworthy of His remembrance,
and of being heard. Yet we though daring <del>to commit</del> innumerable pollutions, and
being of all men most polluted, if we be not heard at our first prayer, draw back. Truly, great
is the distance between them and us, as great as between heaven and earth, or if there be
any greater.</p>
<p>What sayest thou? After so many achievements, after the miracle which had been
wrought in the den, dost thou account thyself so humble? Yea, he says; for what things soever
we have done, “we are unprofitable servants.” ( Luke xvii. 10.) Thus by anticipation did he
fulfill the evangelical precept, and accounted himself nothing. For “God hath remembered
me,” he said. His prayer again, of how great lowliness of mind it is full. And again the three
children said thus, “We have sinned, we have committed iniquity.” ( Song of the Three
Children, ver. 6.) And everywhere they show their humility.</p>
<p>And yet Daniel had occasions innumerable for being puffed up; but he knew that these
also came to him on account of his not being puffed up, and he did not destroy his treasure.
For among all men, and in the whole world he was celebrated, not only3301 because the king
cast himself on his face and offered sacrifice to him, and accounted him to be a God, who
was himself honored as God in all parts of the world: for he ruled over the whole <del>earth</del>;
(and this is evident from Jeremiah. “Who putteth on the earth,” saith he, “as a garment.”
(See Jer. xliii. 12 and Ps. civ. 2.) And again, “I have given it to Nebuchadnezzar My servant”
( Jer. xxvii. 6 ), and again from what he <del>the King</del> says in his letter).3302 And because he
was held in admiration not only in the place where he was, but everywhere, and was greater
than if the rest of the nations had been present and seen him; when even by letters <del>the King</del>
confessed his submission3303 and the miracle. But yet again for his wisdom he was also held
in admiration, for it is said, “Art thou wiser than Daniel?” ( Ezek. xxviii. 3.) And after all
these things he was thus humble, dying ten thousand times for the Lord’s sake.</p>
<p>Why then, you ask, being so humble did he not repel either the adoration which was
paid him by the king, or the offerings?</p>

<p><del>9.</del> This I will not say, for it is sufficient for me simply to mention the question, and
the rest I leave to you, that at least in this way I may stir up your thoughts. (This however I
conjure you, to choose all things for the fear of God, having such examples; and because in
truth we shall obtain the things here also, if we sincerely lay hold on the things which are
to come.) For that he did not do this out of arrogance, is evident from his saying, “Thy gifts
be to thyself.” ( Dan. v. 17.)</p>
<p>For besides this also again is another question, how while in words he rejected it, in
deed he received the honor, and wore the chain3304 <del>of gold</del>. ( Dan. v. 29.)</p>
<p>Moreover while Herod on hearing the cry “It is the voice of a god and not of a man,”
inasmuch as “he gave not God the glory, burst in sunder, and all his bowels gushed out” (
Acts xii. 22, 23; see i. 18 ), this man received to himself even the honor belonging to God,
not words only.</p>
<p>However it is necessary to say what this is. In that case <del>at Lystra</del> the men were falling
into greater idolatry, but in this <del>of Daniel</del> not so. How? For his being thus accounted of,
was an honor to God. Therefore he said in anticipation, “And as to me, not through any
wisdom that is in me.” ( Dan. ii. 30.) And besides he does not even appear to have accepted
the offerings. For he <del>the king</del> said (as it is written) that they should offer sacrifice, but it
did not appear that the act followed. But there <del>at Lystra</del> they carried it even to sacrificing
the bulls, and “they called” the one “Jupiter and” the other “Mercurius.” ( Acts xiv. 12.)</p>
<p>The chain <del>of gold</del> then he accepted, that he might make himself known; the offering
however why does it not appear that he rejected it? For in the other case too they did not
do it, but they attempted it, and the Apostles hindered them; wherefore here also he ought
at once to have rejected <del>the adoration</del>. And there it was the entire people: here the King.
Why he did not divert him <del>Daniel</del> expressed by anticipation, <del>viz.</del> that <del>the king</del> was not
making an offering <del>to him</del> as to a God, to the overthrow of religious worship, but for the
greater wonder. How so? It was on God’s account that <del>Nebuchadnezzar</del> made the decree;
wherefore <del>Daniel</del> did not mutilate3305 the honor <del>offered</del>. But those others <del>at Lystra</del>
did not act thus, but supposed them to be indeed gods. On this account they were repelled.</p>
<p>And here, after having done him reverence, he does these things: for he did not reverence
him as a God, but as a wise man.</p>
<p>But it is not clear that he made the offering: and even if he did make it, yet not that it
was with Daniel’s acceptance.</p>
<p>And what <del>of this</del>, that he called him “Belteshazzar, the name of” his own “god”?3306
Thus <del>it seems</del> they accounted their gods to be nothing wonderful, when he called even
<note type="footnote">3304 μανιάκην</note>

the captive thus; he who commands all men to worship the image,3307 manifold and of
various colors, and who adores the dragon.3308</p>
<p>Moreover the Babylonians were much more foolish than those at Lystra. Wherefore it
was not possible at once to lead them on to this. And many <del>more</del> things one might say:
but thus far these suffice.</p>
<p>If therefore we wish to obtain all good things, let us seek the things of God. For as they
who seek the things of this world fail both of them and of the others, so they who prefer the
things of God, obtain both. Let us then not seek these but those, that we may attain also to
the good things promised in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father together with
the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXVII.</head>
<p>Hebrews xi. 28–31</p>
<p>“Through faith, he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the
first-born should touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land;
which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned.3309 By faith, the walls of Jericho fell
down, after they had been compassed about seven days. By faith, the harlot Rahab perished
not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Paul is wont to establish many things incidently, and is very full3310 of thoughts.
For such is the grace of The Spirit. He does not comprehend a few ideas in a multitude of
words, but includes great and manifold thought in brevity of expressions. Observe at least
how, in the midst3311 of exhortation, and when discoursing about faith, of what a type and
mystery he reminds us, whereof we have the reality. “Through faith” (he says) “he kept the
Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch
them.”</p>
<p>But what is “the sprinkling of blood”?3312 A lamb was slain in every household, and the
blood was smeared on the door-posts, and this was a means of warding off the Egyptian
destruction. If then the blood of a lamb preserved the Jews unhurt in the midst of the
Egyptians, and under so great a destruction, much more will the blood of Christ save us,
who have had it sprinkled3313 not on the door-posts, but in our souls. For even now also
the Destroyer is going about in this depth of night: but let us be armed with that Sacrifice.
(He calls the “sprinkling”3314 anointing.) For God has brought us out from Egypt, from
darkness, from idolatry.</p>
<p>Although what was done, was nothing, what was achieved was great. For what was done
was blood; but was achieved, was salvation, and the stopping, and preventing of destruction.
The angel feared the blood; for he knew of what it was a Type; he shuddered, thinking on
the Lord’s death; therefore he did not touch the door-posts.</p>
<p>Moses said, Smear, and they smeared, and were confident. And you, having the Blood
of the Lamb Himself, are ye not confident?</p>

<p><del>2.</del> “By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land.” Again he compares one
whole people with another, lest they should say, we cannot be as the saints.</p>
<p>“By faith” (he says) “they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians
assaying to do, were drowned.” Here he leads them also to a recollection of the sufferings
in Egypt.</p>
<p>How, “by faith”? Because they had hoped to pass through the sea, and therefore they
prayed: or rather it was Moses who prayed. Seest thou that everywhere Faith goes beyond
human reasonings, and weakness and lowliness? Seest thou that at the same time they both
believed, and feared punishment, both in the blood on the doors, and in the Red Sea?</p>
<p>And he made it clear that it was <del>really</del> water, through those that fell into it, and were
choked; that it was not a mere appearance: but as in the case of the lions those who were
devoured proved the reality of the facts, and in the case of the fiery furnace, those who were
burnt; so here also thou seest that the same things become to the one a cause of salvation3315
and glory, and to the other of destruction.</p>
<p>So great a good is Faith. And when we fall into perplexity, then are we delivered, even
though we come to death itself, even though our condition be desperate. For what else was
left <del>for them</del>? They were unarmed, compassed about by the Egyptians and the sea; and
they must either be drowned if they fled, or fall into the hands of the Egyptians. But nevertheless
<del>He</del> saved them from impossibilities. That which was spread under the one as land,
overwhelmed the others as sea. In the former case it forgot its nature: in the latter it even
armed itself against them. (Cf. Wisd. xix. 20.)</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for
seven days.” For assuredly the sound of trumpets is not able to throw down stones, though
one blow for ten thousand years; but Faith can do all things.</p>
<p>Seest thou that in all cases it is not by natural sequence, nor yet by any law of nature
that it was changed, but all is done contrary to expectation? Accordingly in this case also all
is done contrary to expectation. For inasmuch as he had said again and again, that we ought
to trust to the future hopes, he introduced all this argument with reason, showing that not
now <del>only</del>, but even from the beginning all the miracles have been accomplished and
achieved by means of it.</p>
<p>“By faith, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, having received
the spies with peace.” It would then be disgraceful, if you should appear more faithless even
than a harlot. Yet she <del>merely</del> heard what the men related, and forthwith believed.
Whereupon the end also followed; for when all perished, she alone was preserved. She did
not say to herself, I shall be with my many friends.3316 She did not say, Can I possibly be
<note type="footnote">3315 πρὸς σωτηρίας</note>
<note type="footnote">3316 μετ̓ ἐμῶν</note>

<pb n="915"/>
wiser than these judicious men who do not believe,—and shall I believe? She said no such
thing, but believed what had taken place,3317 which it was likely that they would suffer.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> ( Ver. 32 ) “And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell.” After
this he no longer puts down the names: but having ended with an harlot, and put them to
shame by the quality of the person, he no longer enlarges on the histories, lest he should be
thought tedious. However he does not set them aside, but runs over them, <del>doing</del> both very
judiciously, avoiding satiety, and not spoiling the closeness of arrangement; he was neither
altogether silent, nor did he speak so as to annoy; for he effects both points. For when a man
is contending vehemently <del>in argument</del>, if he persist in contending, he wearies out the
hearer, annoying him when he is already persuaded, and gaining the reputation of vain
ambitiousness. For he ought to accommodate himself to what is expedient.</p>
<p>“And what do I more say” (he says)? “For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and
of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also and Samuel, and of the prophets.”</p>
<p>Some find fault with Paul, because he puts Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah in these
places. What sayest thou? After having introduced the harlot, shall he not introduce these?
For do not tell me of the rest of their life, but only whether they did not believe and shine
in Faith.</p>
<p>“And the prophets,” he says, ( ver. 33 ) “who through faith subdued kingdoms.” Thou
seest that he does not here testify to their life as being illustrious; for this was not the point
in question: but the enquiry thus far was about their faith. For tell me whether they did not
accomplish all by faith?</p>
<p>“By faith,” he says, “they subdued kingdoms;” those with Gideon. “Wrought righteousness;”
who? The same. Plainly he means here, kindness.3318</p>
<p>I think it is of David that he says “they obtained promises.” But of what sort were these?
Those in which He said that his “seed should sit upon” his “throne.” ( Ps. cxxxii. 12.)</p>
<p>“Stopped the mouths of lions,” ( ver. 34 ) “quenched the violence of fire, escaped the
edge of the sword.” See how they were in death itself, Daniel encompassed by the lions, the
three children abiding in the furnace, the Israelites,3319 Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, in divers
temptations; and yet not even so did they despair. For this is Faith; when things are turning
out adversely, then we ought to believe that nothing adverse is done, but all things in due
order.</p>
<p>“Escaped the edge of the sword.” I think that he is again speaking of the three children.</p>

<p>“Out of3320 weakness were made strong.” Here he alludes to what took place at their
return from Babylon. For “out of weakness,” is out of captivity. When the condition of the
Jews had now become desperate, when they were no better than dead bones, who could
have expected that they would return from Babylon, and not return only; but also “wax
valiant” and “turn to flight armies of aliens”? ‘But to us,’ some one says,3321 ‘no such thing
has happened.’ But these are figures of “the things to come.” ( Ver. 35 ) “Women received
their dead raised to life again.” He here speaks of what occurred in regard to the prophets,
Elisha, <del>and</del> Elijah; for they raised the dead.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> ( Ver. 35 ) “And others were tortured,3322 not accepting deliverance, that they might
obtain a better resurrection.” But we have not obtained a Resurrection. I am able however,
he means, to show that they also were cut off, and did “not accept <del>deliverance</del>, that they
might obtain a better resurrection.” For why, tell me, when it was open to them to live, did
they not choose it? Were they not evidently looking for a better life? And they who had
raised up others, themselves chose to die; in order “to obtain a better resurrection,” not such
as the children of those women.3323</p>
<p>Here I think he alludes both to John and to James. For beheading is called “torturing.”3324
It was in their power still to behold the sun. It was in their power to abstain from reproving3325
<del>sinners</del>, and yet they chose to die; even they who had raised others chose to die
themselves, “that they might obtain a better resurrection.”</p>
<p>( Ver. 36 ) “And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea moreover of
bonds and imprisonment.” He ends with these; with things that come nearer home. For
these <del>ex amples</del> especially bring consolation, when the distress is from the same cause,
since even if you mention something more extreme, yet unless it arise from the same cause,
you have effected nothing. Therefore he concluded his discourse with this, mentioning
“bonds, imprisonments, scourges, stonings,” alluding to the case of Stephen, also to that of
Zacharias.</p>
<p>Wherefore he added, “They were slain with the sword.” What sayest thou? Some “escaped
the edge of the sword,” and some “were slain by the sword.” ( Ver. 34.) What is this? Which
dost thou praise? Which dost thou admire? The latter or the former? Nay, he says: the former
indeed, is appropriate to you, and the latter, because Faith was strong even unto death itself,

and it is a type of things to come. For the wonderful qualities of Faith are two, that it both
accomplishes great things, and suffers great things, and counts itself to suffer nothing.</p>
<p>And thou canst not say (he says) that these were sinners and worthless. For even if you
put the whole world against them, I find that they weigh down the beam and are of greater
value.3326 What then were they to receive in this life? Here he raises up their thoughts,
teaching them not to be riveted to things present, but to mind3327 things greater than all
that are in this present life, since the “world is not worthy” of them. What then dost thou
wish to receive here? For it were an insult to thee, shouldst thou receive thy reward here.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Let us not then mind3328 worldly things, nor seek our recompense here, nor be so
beggarly. For if “the” whole “world is not worthy of” them, why dost thou seek after a part
of it? And with good reason; for they are friends of God.</p>
<p>Now by “the world” does he mean here the people, or the creation itself? Both: for the
Scripture is wont to use the word of both. If the whole creation, he would say, with the human
beings that belong to it, were put in the balance, they yet would not be of equal value with
these; and with reason. For as ten thousand measures of chaff and hay would not be of equal
value to ten pearls, so neither they; for “better is one that doeth the will of the Lord, than
ten thousand transgressors” ( Ecclus. xvi. 3 );3329 meaning by “ten thousand” not [merely]
many, but an infinite multitude.</p>
<p>Consider of how great value is the righteous man. Joshua the son of Nun said, “Let the
sun stand still at Gibeon, the moon at the valley of Elom” ( Josh. x. 12 ), and it was so. Let
then the whole world come, or rather two or three, or four, or ten, or twenty worlds, and
let them say and do this; yet shall they not be able. But the friend of God commanded the
creatures of his Friend, or rather he besought his Friend, and the servants yielded, and he
below gave command to those above. Seest thou that these things are for service fulfilling
their appointed course?</p>
<p>This was greater than the <del>miracles</del> of Moses. Why (I ask)? Because it is not a like thing
to command the sea and the heavenly <del>bodies</del>. For that indeed was also a great thing, yea
very great, nevertheless it was not at all equal <del>to the other</del>.</p>
<p>Why was this? The name of Joshua <del>Jesus</del>,3330 was a type. For this reason then, and
because of the very name, the creation reverenced him. What then! Was no other person
called Jesus? <del>Yes</del>; but this man was on this account so called in type; for he used to be

called Hoshea. Therefore the name was changed: for it was a prediction and a prophecy. He
brought in the people into the promised land, as Jesus <del>does</del> into heaven; not the Law; since
neither did Moses <del>bring them in</del>, but remained without. The Law has not power to bring
in, but grace. Seest thou the types which have been before sketched out from the beginning?
He laid his commands on the creation, or rather, on the chief3331 part of the creation, on
the very head itself as he stood below; that so when thou seest Jesus in the form of Man
saying the same, thou mayest not be disturbed, nor think it strange. He, even while Moses
was living, turned back wars. Thus, even while the Law is living, He directs3332 all things;
but not openly.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> But let us consider how great is the virtue of the saints. If here they work such things,
if here they do such things, as the angels do, what then above? How great is the splendor
they have?</p>
<p>Perhaps each of you might wish to be such as to be able to command the sun and moon.
(At this point what would they say who assert that the heaven is a sphere?3333 For why did
he not <del>merely</del> say, “Let the sun stand still,” but added “Let the sun stand still at the valley
of Elom,” that is, he will make the day longer? This was done also in the time of Hezekiah.
The sun went back. This again is more wonderful than the other, to go the contrary way,
not having yet gone round his course.)</p>
<p>We shall attain to greater things than these if we will. For what has Christ promised us?
Not that we shall make the sun stand still, or the moon, nor that the sun shall retrace his
steps, but what? “I and the Father will come unto him,” He says, “and We will make our
abode with him.” ( John xiv. 23.) What need have I of the sun and the moon, and of these
wonders, when the Lord of all Himself comes down and abides with me? I need these not.
For what need I any of these things? He Himself shall be to me for Sun and for Light. For,
tell me, if thou hadst entered into a palace, which wouldst thou choose, to be able to rearrange
some of the things which have been fixed there, or so to make the king a familiar friend, as
to persuade him to take up his abode with thee? Much rather the latter than the former.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> But what wonder is it, says some one, that what a man commands, Christ should
also? But Christ (you say) needs not the Father, but acts of His own authority, you say. Well.
Therefore first confess and say, that he needs not the Father, and acts of His own authority:
and then I will ask thee, whether His prayer is not in the way of condescension and arrangement
(for surely Christ was not inferior to Joshua the son of Nun), and that He might teach

not say that he is ignorant; and when he asks, Where is such a letter? thou knowest that he
does not ask in ignorance, but because he wishes to lead on the scholar; in like manner
Christ also did not make His prayer as needing prayer, but desiring to lead thee on, that
thou mayest continually apply thyself to prayer, that thou mayest do it without ceasing,
soberly, and with great watchfulness.</p>
<p>And by watching, I do not mean, merely the rising at night, but also the being sober3335
in our prayers during the day. For such an one is called watchful.3336 Since it is possible
both in praying by night to be asleep, and in praying by day to be awake, when the soul is
stretched out towards God, when it considers with whom it holds converse, to whom its
words are addressed, when it has in mind that angels stand by with fear and trembling, while
he approaches gaping and scratching himself.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Prayer is a mighty weapon if it be made with suitable mind. And that thou mayest
learn its strength, continued entreaty has overcome shamelessness, and injustice, and savage
cruelty, and overbearing rashness. For He says, “Hear what the unjust judge saith.” ( Luke
xviii. 6.) Again it has overcome sloth also, and what friendship did not effect, this continued
entreaty did: and “although he will not give him because he is his friend” (He says), “yet
because of his importunity he will rise and give to him.” ( Luke xi. 8 ) And continued assiduity
made her worthy who was unworthy. “It is not meet” (He says) “to take the children’s bread
and to cast it to the dogs. Yea! Lord!” she says, “for even the dogs eat <del>the crumbs</del> from
their master’s table.” ( Matt. xv. 26, 27.) Let us apply ourselves to Prayer. It is a mighty
weapon if it be offered with earnestness, if without vainglory, if with a sincere mind. It has
turned back wars, it has benefited an entire nation though undeserving. “I have heard their
groaning” (He says) “and am come down to deliver them.” ( Acts vii. 34.) It is itself a saving
medicine, and has power to prevent sins, and to heal misdeeds. In this the desolate widow
was assiduous. ( 1 Tim. v. 5.)</p>
<p>If then we pray with humility, smiting our breast as the publican, if we utter what he
did, if we say, “Be merciful to me a sinner” ( Luke xviii. 13 ), we shall obtain all. For though
we be not publicans, yet have we other sins not less than his.</p>
<p>For do not tell me, that thou hast gone wrong in some small matter <del>only</del>, since the
thing has the same nature. For as a man is equally called a homicide whether he has killed
a child or a man, so also is he called overreaching whether he be overreaching in much or
in little. Yea and to remember injuries too, is no small matter, but even a great sin. For it is
said, “the ways of those who remember injuries <del>tend</del> to death.” ( Prov. xii. 28 , LXX.) And
“He that is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of hell,” and he that
“calleth his brother a fool” ( Matt. v. 22 ), and senseless, and numberless such things.</p>

<p>But we partake even of the tremendous mysteries unworthily, and we envy, and we revile.
And some of us have even oftentimes been drunk. But each one of these things, even itself
by itself, is enough to cast us out of the kingdom, and when they even come all together,
what comfort shall we have? We need much penitence, beloved, much prayer, much endurance,
much perseverance, that we may be enabled to attain the good things which have been
promised to us.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> Let us then say, even we, “Be merciful to me a sinner,” nay rather, let us not say it
only, but let us also be thus minded; and should another call us so, let us not be angry. He
heard the words, “I am not as this Publican” ( Luke xviii. 11 ), and was not provoked thereby,
but filled with compunction. He accepted the reproach, and he put away the reproach. The
other spoke of the wound, and he sought the medicine. Let us say then, “Be merciful to me
a sinner” ( Luke xviii. 13 ); but even if another should so call us, let us not be indignant.</p>
<p>But if we say ten thousand evil things of ourselves, and are vexed when we hear them
from others, then there is no longer humility, nor confession, but ostentation and vainglory.
Is it ostentation (you say) to call one’s self a sinner? Yes; for we obtain the credit of humility,
we are admired, we are commended; whereas if we say the contrary of ourselves, we are
despised. So that we do this too for the sake of credit. But what is humility? It is when another
reviles us, to bear it, to acknowledge our fault, to endure evil speakings. And yet even this
would not be <del>a mark</del> of humility but of candor. But now we call ourselves sinners, unworthy,
and ten thousand other such names, but if another apply one of them to us, we are vexed,
we become savage. Seest thou that this is not confession, nor even candor? Thou saidst of
thyself that thou art such an one: be not indignant if thou hearest it also said by others, and
art reproved.</p>
<p>In this way thy sins are made lighter for thee, when others reproach thee: for they lay a
burden on themselves indeed, but thee they lead onwards into philosophy. Hear what the
blessed David says, when Shimei cursed him, “Let him alone” (he says) “the Lord hath bidden
him, that He might look on my humiliation” (he says): “And the Lord will requite me good
for his cursing on this day.” ( 2 Sam. xvi. 11, 12.)</p>
<p>But thou while saying evil things of thyself, even in excess, if thou hearest not from
others the commendations that are due to the most righteous, art enraged. Seest thou that
thou art trifling with things that are no subjects for trifling? For we even repudiate praises
in our desire for other praises, that we may obtain yet higher panegyrics, that we may be
more admired. So that when we decline to accept commendations, we do it that we may
augment them. And all things are done by us for credit, not for truth. Therefore all things
are hollow, all impracticable. Wherefore I beseech you now at any rate to withdraw from
this mother of evils, vainglory, and to live according to what is approved by God, that so
you may attain to the good things to come, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the

<p>Hebrews xi. 37, 38</p>
<p>“They wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of
whom this3337 world was not worthy); wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in
dens, and caves of the earth.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> At all times indeed, but especially then when I reflect upon the achievements of the
saints, it comes over me to feel despondency concerning my own condition,3338 because
we have not even in dreams experienced the things among which those men spent their
whole lives, not paying the penalty of sins, but always doing rightly and yet always afflicted.</p>
<p>For consider, I beseech you, Elijah, to whom our discourse has come round to-day, for
he speaks of him in this passage, and in him his examples end: which <del>example</del> was appropriate
to their case. And having spoken of what befell the Apostles, that “they were slain
with the sword, were stoned,” he goes back again to Elijah, who suffered the same things
with them. (See 2 Kings i. 8.) For since it was probable that they would not as yet hold the
Apostles in so great estimation, he brings his exhortation and consolation from him who
had been taken up <del>into Heaven</del> and who was held in special admiration.</p>
<p>For “they wandered about” (he says) “in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute,
afflicted, tormented,3339 of whom this world was not worthy.”</p>
<p>They had not even raiment, he says, through the excess of affliction, no city, no house,
no lodging-place; the same which Christ said, “but the Son of Man hath not where to lay
His head.” ( Matt. viii. 20.) Why do I say “no lodging-place”? No standing-place: for not
even when they had gained the wilderness, were they at rest. For he said not, They sat down
in the wilderness, but even when they were there, they fled, and were driven thence, not out
of the inhabited world only, but even out of that which was uninhabitable. And he reminds
them of the places where they were set, and of things which there befell <del>them</del>.</p>
<p>Then next, he says, they bring accusations against you for Christ’s sake. What accusation
had they against Elijah, when they drove him out, and persecuted him, and compelled him
to struggle with famine? Which these <del>Hebrews</del> were then suffering. At least, the brethren,
it is said, decided to send <del>relief</del> to those of the disciples who were afflicted. “Every man
<note type="footnote">3337 οὗτος. Mr. F. observes that St. Chrys. more usually cites the text without οὗτος</note>
<note type="footnote">3338 ἀ παγορεύειν τὰ καθ̓ ἑ</note>
<note type="footnote">3339 “ill-treated,” κακουχούμενοι</note>

<pb n="923"/>
according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea” (
Acts xi. 29 ), which was <del>the case</del> of these also.</p>
<p>“Tormented” <del>or “ill-treated”</del>, he says; that is, suffering distress, in journeyings, in
dangers.</p>
<p>But “They wandered about,” what is this? “Wandering,” he says, “in deserts and in
mountains and in dens and caves of the earth,” like exiles and outcasts, as persons taken in
the basest <del>of crimes</del>, as those not worthy to see the sun, they found no refuge from the
wilderness, but must always be flying, must be seeking hiding-places, must bury themselves
alive in the earth, always be in terror.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> What then is the reward of so great a change?3340 What is the recompense?</p>
<p>They have not yet received it, but are still waiting; and after thus dying in so great
tribulation, they have not yet received it. They gained their victory so many ages ago, and
have not yet received <del>their reward</del>. And you who are yet in the conflict, are you vexed?</p>
<p>Do you also consider what a thing it is, and how great, that Abraham should be sitting,
and the Apostle Paul, waiting till thou hast been perfected, that then they may be able to
receive their reward. For the Saviour has told them before that unless we also are present,
He will not give it them. As an affectionate father might say to sons who were well approved,
and had accomplished their work, that he would not give them to eat, unless their brethren
came. And art thou vexed, that thou hast not yet received the reward? What then shall Abel
do, who was victor before all, and is sitting uncrowned? And what Noah? And what, they
who lived in those <del>early</del> times: seeing that they wait for thee and those after thee?</p>
<p>Dost thou see that we have the advantage of them? For “God” (he says) “has provided
some better thing for us.” In order that they might not seem to have the advantage of us
from being crowned before us, He appointed one time of crowning for all; and he that gained
the victory so many years before, receives his crown with thee. Seest thou His tender carefulness?</p>
<p>And he did not say, “that they without us might not be crowned,” but “that they without
us might not be made perfect”; so that at that time they appear perfect also. They were before
us as regards the conflicts, but are not before us as regards the crowns. He wronged not
them, but He honored us. For they also wait for the brethren. For if we are “all one body,”
the pleasure becomes greater to this body, when it is crowned altogether, and not part by
part. For the righteous are also worthy of admiration in this, that they rejoice in the welfare
of their brethren, as in their own. So that for themselves also, this is according to their wish,
to be crowned along with their own members. To be glorified all together, is a great delight.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> ( C. xii. 1 ) “Wherefore” (he says) “we also being compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses.” In many places the Scripture derives its consolation in evils from cor-
<note type="footnote">3340 ἀ μοιβῆς, i.e. the accepting sufferings instead of an easy life.</note>

<pb n="924"/>
responding things. As when the prophet says, “From burning heat, and from storm, and
rain.” ( Isa. iv. 6.) This at least he says here also, that the memory of those holy men, reestablishes
and recovers the soul which had been weighed down by woes, as a cloud does him
who is burnt by the too hot rays <del>of the sun.</del></p>
<p>And he did not say, “lifted on high above us,” but, “compassing us about,” which was
more than the other; so that we are in greater security.</p>
<p>What sort of “cloud”? “A load of witnesses.”3341 With good reason he calls not those
in the New <del>Testament</del> only, but those in the Old also, “witnesses” <del>or “martyrs”</del>. For they
also were witnesses to the greatness of God, as for instance, the Three Children, those with
Elijah, all the prophets.</p>
<p>“Laying aside all things.” “All”: what? That is, slumber, indifference, mean reasonings,
all human things.</p>
<p>“And the sin which doth <del>so</del> easily beset us”; εὐπερίστατον, that is either, “which easily
circumvents us,” or “what can easily be circumvented,”3342 but rather this latter. For it is
easy, if we will, to overcome sin.</p>
<p>“Let us run with patience” (he says) “the race that is set before us.” He did not say, Let
us contend as boxers, nor, Let us wrestle, nor, Let us do battle: but, what was lightest of all,
the <del>contest</del> of the foot-race, this has he brought forward. Nor yet did he say, Let us add to
the length of the course; but, Let us continue patiently in this, let us not faint. “Let us run”
(he says) “the race that is set before us.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> In the next place as the sum and substance of his exhortation, which he puts both
first and last, even Christ. ( Ver. 2 ) “Looking” (he says) “unto Jesus the Author and Finisher
of our Faith”; The very thing which Christ Himself also continually said to His disciples, “If
they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of His household?”
( Matt. x. 25.) And again, “The disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his
Lord.” ( Matt. x. 24.)</p>
<p>“Looking” (he says), that is, that we may learn to run. For as in all arts and games, we
impress the art upon our mind by looking to our masters, receiving certain rules through
our sight, so here also, if we wish to run, and to learn to run well, let us look to Christ, even
to Jesus “the author and finisher of our faith.” What is this? He has put the Faith within us.
For He said to His disciples, “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you” ( John xv. 16
<note type="footnote">3341 μαρτύρων ὄγκον. St. Chrys. connects ὄ γκον with μαρτύρων and takes πάντα as a neuter plural; the

); and Paul too says, “But then shall I know, even as also I have been known.”3343 ( 1 Cor.
xiii. 12.) He put the Beginning into us, He will also put on the End.</p>
<p>“Who,” he says, “for the joy that was set before Him, endured the Cross, despising the
shame.” That is, it was in His power not to suffer at all, if He so willed. For “He did no sin,
neither was guile found in His mouth” ( 1 Pet. ii. 22 ); as He also says in the Gospels, “The
Prince of the world cometh and hath nothing in Me.” ( John xiv. 30.) It lay then in His
power, if so He willed, not to come to the Cross. For, “I have power,” He says, “to lay down
My life; and I have power to take it again.” ( John x. 18.) If then He who was under no necessity
of being crucified, was crucified for our sake, how much more is it right that we
should endure all things nobly!</p>
<p>“Who for the joy that was set before Him” (he says) “endured the cross, despising the
shame.” But what is, “Despising the shame”? He chose, he means, that ignominious death.
For suppose that He died. Why <del>should He</del> also <del>die</del> ignominiously? For no other reason,
but to teach us to make no account of glory from men. Therefore though under no obligation
He chose it, teaching us to be bold against it, and to set it at nought. Why did he say not
“pain,” but “shame”? Because it was not with pain3344 that He bore these things.</p>
<p>What then is the end? “He is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Seest
thou the prize which Paul also says in an epistle, “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name, that at the Name of Jesus Christ
every knee should bow.” ( Philip. ii. 9, 10.) He speaks in respect to the flesh.3345 Well then,
even if there were no prize, the example would suffice to persuade us to accept all <del>such</del>
things. But now prizes also are set before us, and these no common ones, but great and unspeakable.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> Wherefore let us also, whenever we suffer anything of this kind, before the Apostles
consider Christ. Why? His whole life was full of insults. For He continually heard Himself
called mad, and a deceiver, and a sorcerer; and at one time the Jews said, “Nay,” (it says)
“but He deceiveth the people.” ( John vii. 12.) And again, “That deceiver said while He was
yet alive, after three days I will rise again.” ( Matt. xxvii. 63.) As to sorcery too they calumniated
Him, saying, “He casteth out the devils by Beelzebub.” ( Matt. xii. 24.) And that “He is
mad and hath a devil.” ( John x. 20.) “Said we not well” (it says) “that He hath a devil and
is mad?” ( John viii. 48.)</p>
<p>And these things He heard from them, when doing them good, performing miracles,
showing forth the works of God. For indeed, if He had been so spoken of, when He did
nothing, it would not have been so wonderful: But <del>it is wonderful</del> that when He was
<note type="footnote">3343 ἐ πεγνώσθην</note>
<note type="footnote">3344 λύπης</note>
<note type="footnote">3345 the human nature.</note>

<pb n="926"/>
teaching what pertained to Truth He was called “a deceiver,” and when He cast out devils,
was said to “have a devil,” and when He was overthrowing all that was opposed <del>to God</del>,
was called a sorcerer. For these things they were continually alleging against Him.</p>
<p>And if thou wouldst know both the scoffs3346 and the ironical jeerings,3347 which they
made against Him (what particularly wounds our souls), hear first those from His kindred.
“Is not this” (it says) “the carpenter’s son, whose father and mother we know? Are not his
brethren all with us?” ( Matt. xiii. 55; Mark vi. 3; John vi. 42.) Also scoffing at Him from His
country, they said He was “of Nazareth.” And again, “search,” it says, “and see, for out of
Galilee hath no prophet arisen.” ( John vii. 52.) And He endured being so greatly calumniated.
And again they said, “Doth not the Scripture say, that Christ cometh from the town
of Bethlehem?” ( John vii. 42.)</p>
<p>Wouldst thou see also the ironical jeerings they made? Coming, it says, to the very cross
they worshiped Him; and they struck Him and buffeted Him, and said, “Tell us who it is
that smote Thee” ( Matt. xxvi. 68 ); and they brought vinegar to Him, and said, “If Thou be
the Son of God, come down from the Cross.” ( Matt. xxvii. 40.) And again, the servant of
the High Priest struck Him with the palm of his hand; and He says, “If I have spoken evil,
bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smiteth thou Me?” ( John xviii. 23.) And in derision
they put a robe about Him; and they spat in His face; and they were continually applying
their tests, tempting Him.</p>
<p>Wouldest thou see also the accusations, some secret, some open, some from disciples?
“Will ye also go away?” ( John vi. 67 ) He says. And that saying, “Thou hast a devil” ( John
viii. 48, vii. 20 ), was uttered by those who already believed. Was He not continually a fugitive,
sometimes in Galilee, and sometimes in Judea? Was not His trial great, even from the
swaddling clothes? When He was yet a young child, did not His mother take Him and go
down into Egypt? For all these reasons he says, “Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher
of our Faith who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”</p>
<p>To Him then let us look, also to the <del>sufferings3348</del> of His disciples, reading the <del>writings3349</del>
of Paul, and hearing him say, “In much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
persecutions,3350 in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments.” ( 2 Cor. vi. 4, 5.) And again,
“Even to this present hour, we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and

have no certain dwelling-place, and labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we
bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat.” ( 1 Cor. iv. 11–13.) Has
any one <del>of us</del> suffered the smallest part of these things? For, he says, <del>we are</del> “As deceivers,
as dishonored, as having nothing.” ( 2 Cor. vi. 8, 10.) And again, “Of the Jews five times received
I forty stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, a night and
a day have I been in the deep; in journeyings often, in tribulations, in distress, in hunger.”
( 2 Cor. xi. 24–26.) And that these things seem good to God, hear him saying, “For this I
besought the Lord thrice, and He said to me, My Grace is sufficient for thee; for My strength
is made perfect in weakness.” ( 2 Cor. xii. 8–10.) “Wherefore,” he says, “I take pleasure in
infirmities, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, that the
power of Christ may rest upon me.” Moreover, hear Christ Himself saying, “In the world
ye shall have tribulation.” ( John xvi. 33.)</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Ver. 3. “For consider,” saith he, “Him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.” For if the sufferings of those
near us arouse us, what earnestness will not those of our Master give us! What will they not
work in us!</p>
<p>And passing by all <del>else</del>, he expressed the whole by the <del>word</del> “Contradiction”; and
by adding “such.” For the blows upon the cheek, the laughter, the insults, the reproaches,
the mockeries, all these he indicated by “contradiction.” And not these only, but also the
things which befell Him during His whole life, of teaching.</p>
<p>For a great, a truly great consolation are both the sufferings of Christ, and those of the
Apostles. For He so well knew that this is the better way of virtue, as even to go that way
Himself, not having need thereof: He knew so well that tribulation is expedient for us, and
that it becomes rather a foundation for repose. For hear Him saying, “If a man take not his
cross, and follow after Me, he is not worthy of Me.” ( Matt. x. 38.) If thou art a disciple, He
means, imitate the Master; for this is <del>to be</del> a disciple. But if while He went by <del>the path of</del>
affliction, thou <del>goest</del> by that of ease, thou no longer treadest the same path, which He trod,
but another. How then dost thou follow, when thou followest not? How shalt thou be a
disciple, not going after the Master? This Paul also says, “We are weak, but ye are strong;
we are despised, but ye are honored.” ( 1 Cor. iv. 10.) How is it reasonable, he means, that
we should be striving after opposite things, and yet that you should be disciples and we
teachers?</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Affliction then is a great thing, beloved, for it accomplishes two great things; It wipes
out sins, and it makes men strong.</p>
<p>What then, you say, if it overthrow and destroy? Affliction does not do this, but our
own slothfulness. How (you say)? If we are sober and watchful, if we beseech God that He
would not “suffer us to be tempted above that we are able” ( 1 Cor. x. 13 ), if we always hold
fast to Him, we shall stand nobly, and set ourselves against our enemy. So long as we have

<pb n="928"/>
Him for our helper, though temptations blow more violently than all the winds, they will
be to us as chaff and a leaf borne lightly along. Hear Paul saying, “In all these things” (are
his words) “we are more than conquerors.” ( Rom. viii. 37.) And again, “For I reckon that
the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
be revealed in us.” ( Rom. viii. 18.) And again, “For the light affliction which is but for a
moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” ( 2 Cor. iv. 17.)</p>
<p>Consider what great dangers, shipwrecks, afflictions one upon another, and other such
things, he calls “light”; and emulate this inflexible one, who wore this body simply and
heedlessly.3351 Thou art in poverty? But not in such as Paul, who was tried by hunger, and
thirst, and nakedness. For he suffered this not for one day, but endured it continually.
Whence does this appear? Hear himself saying, “Even unto this present hour we both hunger
and thirst and are naked.” ( 1 Cor. iv. 11.) Oh! How great glory did he already have in
preaching, when he was undergoing so great <del>afflictions</del>! Having now <del>reached</del> the twentieth
year <del>thereof</del>, at the time when he wrote this. For he says, “I knew a man fourteen
years ago, whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not.” ( 2 Cor. xii. 2.) And again,
“After three years” (he says) “I went up to Jerusalem.” ( Gal. i. 18.) And again hear him
saying, “It were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.” (
1 Cor. ix. 15.) And not only this, but again also in writing he said, “We are become as the
filth of the world.” ( 1 Cor. iv. 13.) What is more difficult to endure than hunger? What than
freezing cold? What than plottings made by brethren whom he afterwards calls “false
brethren”? ( 2 Cor. xi. 26.) Was he not called the pest of the world? An Impostor? A subverter?
Was he not cut with scourging?</p>
<p><del>8.</del> These things let us take into our mind, beloved, let us consider them, let us hold
them in remembrance, and then we shall never faint, though we be wronged, though we be
plundered, though we suffer innumerable evils. Let it be granted us to be approved in
Heaven, and all things <del>are</del> endurable. Let it be granted us to fare well there, and things
here are of no account. These things are a shadow, and a dream; whatever they may be, they
are nothing either in nature or in duration, while those are hoped for and expected.</p>
<p>For what wouldst thou that we should compare with those fearful things? What with
the unquenchable fire? With the never-dying worm? Which of the things here canst thou
name in comparison with the “gnashing of teeth,” with the “chains,” and the “outer darkness,”
with the “wrath,” the “tribulation,” the “anguish”? But as to duration? Why, what are ten
thousand years to ages boundless and without end? Not so much as a little drop to the
boudless ocean.</p>
<p>But what about the good things? There, the superiority is still greater. “Eye hath not
seen,” (it is said,) “ear hath not heard, neither have, entered into the heart of man” ( 1 Cor.
<note type="footnote">3351 ἁ πλῶς καὶ εἰκῆ</note>

<pb n="929"/>
ii. 9 ), and these things again shall be during boundless ages. For the sake of these then were
it not well to be cut <del>by scourging</del> times out of number, to be slain, to be burned, to undergo
ten thousand deaths, to endure everything whatsoever that is dreadful both in word and
deed? For even if it were possible for one to live when burning in the fire, ought one not to
endure all for the sake of attaining to those good things promised?</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But why do I trifle in saying these things to men who do not even choose to disregard
riches, but hold fast to them as though they were immortal? And if they give a little out of
much, think they have done all? This is not Almsgiving. For Almsgiving is that of the Widow
who emptied out “all her living.” ( Mark xii. 44.) But if thou dost not go on to contribute so
much as the widow, yet at least contribute the whole of thy superfluity: keep what is sufficient,
not what is superfluous.</p>
<p>But there is no one who contributes even his superabundance. For so long as thou hast
many servants,3352 and garments of silk, these things are all superfluities. Nothing is indispensable
or necessary, without which we are able to live; these things are superfluous, and
are simply superadded.3353 Let us then see, if you please, what we cannot live without. If
we have only two servants, we can live. For whereas some live without servants, what excuse
have we, if we are not content with two? We can also have a house built of brick of three
rooms;3354 and this were sufficient for us. For are there not some with children and wife
who have but one room?3355 Let there be also, if you will, two serving boys.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> And how is it not a shame (you say) that a gentlewoman3356 should walk out with
<del>only</del> two servants? It is no shame, that a gentlewoman should walk abroad with two servants,
but it is a shame that she should go forth with many. Perhaps you laugh when you
hear this. Believe me it is a shame. Do you think it a great matter to go out with many servants,
like dealers in sheep, or dealers in slaves? This is pride and vainglory, the other is
philosophy and respectability. For a gentlewoman ought not to be known from the multitude
of her attendants. For what virtue is it to have many slaves? This belongs not to the soul,
and whatever is not of the soul does not show gentility. When she is content with a few
things, then is she a gentlewoman indeed; but when she needs many, she is a servant and
inferior to slaves. Tell me, do not the angels go to and fro about the world alone, and need
not any one to follow them? Are they then on this account inferior to us? They who need
no <del>attendants</del> to us who need them? If then not needing an attendant at all, is angelic, who

<pb n="930"/>
comes nearer to the angelic life, she who needs many <del>attendants</del>, or she who <del>needs</del> few?
Is not this a shame? For a shame it is to do anything out of place.</p>
<p>Tell me who attracts the attention of those who are in the public places,3357 she who
brings many in her train, or she who <del>brings but</del> few? And is not she who is alone, less
conspicuous even than she who is attended by few? Seest thou that this <del>first-named conduct</del>
is a shame? Who attracts the attention of those in the public places, she who wears beautiful
garments, or she who is dressed simply and artlessly? Again who attracts those in the public
places, she who is borne on mules, and with trappings ornamented with gold, or she who
walks out simply, and as it may be, with propriety? Or we do not even look at this latter, if
we even see her; but the multitudes not only force their way to see the other, but also ask,
Who is she, and Where from? And I do not say how great envy is hereby produced. What
then (tell me), is it disgraceful to be looked at or not to be looked at? When is the shame
greater, when all stare at her, or when no one <del>does</del>? When they inform themselves about
her, or when they do not even care? Seest thou that we do everything, not for modesty’s
sake but for vainglory?</p>
<p>However, since it is impossible to draw you away from that, I am content for the present
that you should learn that this <del>conduct</del> is no disgrace. Sin alone is a disgrace, which no
one thinks to be a disgrace. Sin alone is a disgrace, which no one thinks to be a disgrace, but
everything rather than this.</p>
<p><del>11.</del> Let your dress be such as is needful, not superfluous. However, that we may not
shut you up too narrowly, this I assure you, that we have no need of ornaments of gold, or
of lace.3358 And it is not I who say this. For that the words are not mine, hear the blessed
Paul saying, and solemnly charging women “to adorn themselves, not with plaitings <del>of the
hair</del>, or gold, or pearls, or costly apparel.” ( 1 Tim. ii. 9.) But with what kind, O Paul,
wouldest thou tell us? For perhaps they will say, that only golden things are costly; and that
silks are not costly. Tell us with what kind thou wouldest? “But having food and raiment,3359
let us therewith” (he says) “be content.”3360 ( 1 Tim. vi. 8.) Let our garment be such as merely
to cover us. For God hath given them to us for this reason, that we may cover our nakedness;
and this any sort of garment can do, though but of trifling cost. Perhaps ye laugh, who wear
dresses of silk; for in truth one may well laugh, considering what Paul enjoined and what
we practice!</p>
<p>But my discourse is not addressed to women only, but also to men. For the rest of the
things which we have are all superfluous; only the poor possess no superfluities; and perhaps
<note type="footnote">3357 the open spaces of the streets where idlers gathered.</note>
<note type="footnote">3358 λεπτῶν ὀθονίων</note>

they too from necessity: since, if it had been in their power, even they would not have abstained
<del>from them</del>. Nevertheless, “whether in pretense or in truth” ( Philip. i. 18 ), so far
they have no superfluities.</p>
<p><del>12.</del> Let us then wear such clothes as are sufficient for our need. For what does much
gold mean? To those on the stage these things are fitting, this apparel belongs to them, to
harlots, to those who do everything to be looked at. Let her beautify herself, who is on the
stage or the dancing platform. For she wishes to attract all to her. But a woman who professes
godliness, let her not beautify herself thus, but in a different way. Thou hast a means of
beautifying thyself far better than that. Thou also hast a theater:3361 for that theater make
thyself beautiful: clothe thyself with those ornaments. What is thy theater? Heaven, the
company of Angels. I speak not of Virgins only, but also of those in the world. All as many
as believe in Christ have that theater. Let us speak such things that we may please those
spectators. Put on such garments that thou mayest gratify them.</p>
<p>For tell me, if a harlot putting aside her golden ornaments, and her robes, and her
laughter, and her witty and unchaste talk, clothe herself with a cheap garment, and having
dressed herself simply come <del>on the stage</del>, and utter religious words, and discourse of
chastity, and say nothing indelicate, will not all rise up? Will not this theater be dispersed?
Will they not cast her out, as one who does not know how to suit herself to the crowd, and
speaks things foreign to that Satanic theater? So thou also, if thou enter into the Theater of
Heaven clad with her garments, the spectators will cast thee out. For there, there is no need
of these garments of gold, but of different ones. Of what kind? Of such as the prophet names,
“clothed in fringed work of gold, and in varied colors” ( Ps. xlv. 13 ), not so as to make the
body white and glistering, but so as to beautify the soul. For the soul it is, which is contending
and wrestling in that Theater. “All the glory of the King’s daughter is from within” ( Ps. xlv.
13 ), it says. With these do thou clothe thyself; for [so] thou both deliverest thyself from
other evils innumerable, and thy husband from anxiety and thyself from care.</p>
<p>For so thou wilt be respected by thy husband, when thou needest not many things. For
every man is wont to be shy towards those who make requests of him; but when he sees that
they have no need of him, then he lets down his pride, and converses with them as equals.
When thy husband sees that thou hast no need of him in anything, that thou thinkest lightly
of the presents which come from him, then, even though he be very arrogant,3362 he will
respect thee more, than if thou wert clad in golden ornaments; and thou wilt no longer be
his slave. For those of whom we stand in need, we are compelled to stoop to. But if we restrain
ourselves we shall no longer be regarded as criminals,3363 but he knows that we pay him
<note type="footnote">3361 “body of spectators.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3362 φρονηματιῶν</note>
<note type="footnote">3363 ὑ πόδικοι</note>

<pb n="932"/>
obedience from the fear of God, not for what is given by him. For now, when that he confers
great favors on us, whatever honor he receives, he thinks he has not received all <del>that is due
to him</del>: but then, though he obtain but a little, he will account it a favor he does not reproach,
nor will he be himself compelled to overreach on thy account.</p>
<p><del>13.</del> For what is more unreasonable, than to provide golden ornaments, to be worn in
baths, and in market places? However, in baths and in market places it is perhaps no wonder,
but that a woman should come into Church so decked out is very ridiculous. For, for what
possible reason does she come in here wearing golden ornaments, she who ought to come
in that she may hear <del>the precept</del> “that they adorn not themselves with gold, nor pearls,
nor costly array”? ( 1 Tim. ii. 9.) With what object then, O woman, dost thou come? Is it
indeed to fight with Paul, and show that even if he repeat these things ten thousand times
thou regardest them not? Or is it as wishing to put us your teachers to shame as discoursing
on these subjects in vain? For tell me; if any heathen and unbeliever, after he has heard the
passage read where the blessed Paul says these things, having a believing wife, sees that she
makes much account of beautifying herself, and puts on ornaments of gold, that she may
come into Church and hear Paul charging <del>the women</del> that they adorn themselves, neither
with “gold” ( 1 Tim. ii. 9 ), nor with “pearls,” nor with “costly array,” will he not indeed say
to himself, when he sees her in her little room,3364 putting on these things, and arranging
them beautifully, “Why is my wife staying within in her little room? Why is she so slow?
Why is she putting on her golden ornaments? Where has she to go to? Into the Church?
For what purpose? To hear? ‘not with costly array’;” will he not smile, will he not burst out
into laughter? will he not think our religion3365 a mockery and a deceit? Wherefore, I beseech
<del>you</del>, let us leave golden ornaments to processions, to theaters, to signs on the shops.3366
But let not the image of God be decked out with these things: let the gentlewoman be adorned
with gentility, and gentility is the absence of pride, and of boastful display.</p>
<p>Nay even if thou wish to obtain glory from men, thou wilt obtain it thus. For we shall
not wonder so much that the wife of a rich man wears gold and silk (for this is the common
practice of them all), as when she is dressed in a plain and simple garment made merely of
wool. This all will admire, this they will applaud. For in that adorning indeed of ornaments
of gold and of costly apparel, she has many to share with her. And if she surpass one, she is
surpassed by another. Yea, even if she surpass all, she must yield the palm to the Empress
herself. But in the other case, she outdoes all, even the Emperor’s wife herself. For she alone
in wealth, has chosen the <del>dress</del> of the poor. So that even if we desire glory, here too the
glory is greater.</p>

<p><del>14.</del> I say this not only to widows, and to the rich; for here the necessity of widowhood
seems to cause this: but to those also who have a husband.</p>
<p>But, you say, I do not please my husband <del>if I dress plainly</del>. It is not thy husband thou
wishest to please, but the multitude of poor women; or rather not to please them, but to
make them pine <del>with envy</del>, and to give them pain, and make their poverty greater. How
many blasphemies are uttered because of thee! ‘Let there be no poverty’ (say they). ‘God
hates the poor.’ ‘God loves not those in poverty.’ For that it is not thy husband whom thou
wishest to please, and for this reason thou deckest thyself out, thou makest plain to all by
what thou thyself doest. For as soon as thou hast passed over the threshold of thy chamber,
3367 thou immediately puttest off all, both the robes, and the golden ornaments, and the
pearls; and at home of all places thou dost not wear them.</p>
<p>But if thou really wishest to please thy husband, there are ways of pleasing him, by
gentleness, by meekness, by propriety. For believe me, O woman, even if thy husband be
infinitely debased,3368 these are the things which will more effectually win him, gentleness,
propriety, freedom from pride and expensiveness and extravagance. For even if thou devise
ten thousand such things, thou wilt not restrain the profligate. And this they know who
have had such husbands. For however thou mayest beautify thyself, he being a profligate
will go off to a courtesan; while [the husband] that is chaste and regular thou wilt gain not
by these means, but by the opposite: yea by these thou even causest him pain, clothing thyself
with the reputation of a lover of the world. For what if thy husband out of respect, and that
as a sober-minded man, does not speak, yet inwardly he will condemn thee, and will not
conceal3369 ill-will3370 and jealousy. Wilt thou not drive away all pleasure for the future, by
exciting ill-will against thyself?</p>
<p><del>15.</del> Possibly you are annoyed at hearing what is said, and are indignant, saying, ‘He
irritates husbands still more against their wives.’ I say this, not to irritate your husbands,
but I wish that these things should be done by you willingly, for your own sakes, not for
theirs; not to free them from envy but to free you from the parade of this life.</p>
<p>Dost thou wish to appear beautiful? I also wish it, but with beauty which God seeks,
which “the King desires.”3371 ( Ps. xlv. 11.) Whom wouldst thou have as a Lover? God or
men? Shouldest thou be beautiful with that beauty, God will “desire thy beauty”; but if with
the other apart from this, He will abominate thee, and thy lovers will be profligates. For no
man who loves a married woman is good. Consider this even in regard to the adorning that

<pb n="934"/>
is external. For the other adorning, I mean that of the soul, attracts God; but this again,
profligates. Seest thou that I care for you, that I am anxious for you, that ye may be beautiful,
really beautiful, splendid, really splendid, that instead of profligate men, ye may have for
your Lover God the Lord of all? And she who has Him for her Lover, to whom will she be
like? She has her place among the choirs of Angels. For if one who is beloved of a king is
accounted happy above all, what will her dignity be who is beloved of God with much love?
Though thou put the whole world <del>in the balance against it</del>, there is nothing equivalent to
that beauty.</p>
<p>This beauty then let us cultivate; with these embellishments let us adorn ourselves, that
we may pass into the Heavens, into the spiritual chambers, into the nuptial chamber that is
undefiled. For this beauty is liable to be destroyed by anything; and when it lasts well, and
neither disease nor anxiety impair it (which is impossible), it does not last twenty years. But
the other is ever blooming, ever in its prime. There, there is no change to fear; no old age
coming brings a wrinkle, no undermining disease withers it; no desponding anxiety disfigures
it; but it is far above all these things. But this <del>earthly beauty</del> takes flight before it appears,
and if it appears it has not many admirers. For those of well-ordered minds do not admire
it; and those who do admire it, admire with wantonness.</p>
<p><del>16.</del> Let us not therefore cultivate this <del>beauty</del>, but the other: let us have that, so that
with bright torches we may pass into the bridal chamber. For not to virgins only has this
been promised, but to virgin souls. For had it belonged merely to virgins, those five would
not have been shut out. This then belongs to all who are virgins in soul, who are freed from
worldly imaginations: for these imaginations corrupt our souls. If therefore we remain unpolluted,
we shall depart thither, and shall be accepted. “For I have espoused you,” he says,
“to one husband, to present you a chaste virgin unto Christ.” ( 2 Cor. xi. 2.) These things
he said, not with reference to Virgins, but to the whole body of the entire Church. For the
uncorrupt soul is a virgin, though she have a husband: she is a virgin as to that which is
Virginity indeed, that which is worthy of admiration. For this of the body is but the accompaniment
and shadow of the other: while that is the True Virginity. This let us cultivate,
and so shall we be able with cheerful countenance to behold the Bridegroom, to enter in
with bright torches, if the oil do not fail us, if by melting down our golden ornaments we
procure such oil as makes our lamps bright. And this oil is lovingkindness.</p>
<p>If we impart what we have to others, if we make oil therefrom, then it will protect us,
and we shall not say at that time, “Give us oil, for our lamps are going out” ( Matt. xxv. 8 ),
nor shall we beg of others, nor shall we be shut out when we are gone to them that sell, nor
shall we hear that fearful and terrible voice, while we are knocking at the doors, “I know
you not.” ( Matt. xxv. 12.) But He will acknowledge us, and we shall go in with the Bridegroom,
and having entered into the spiritual Bride-chamber we shall enjoy good things innumerable.</p>

<pb n="935"/>
<p>For if here the bride-chamber is so bright, the rooms so splendid, that none is weary of
observing them, much more there. Heaven is the chamber,3372 and the bride-chamber3373
better than Heaven; then we shall enter. But if the Bride-chamber is so beautiful, what will
the Bridegroom be?</p>
<p>And why do I say, ‘Let us put away our golden ornaments, and give to the needy’? For
if ye ought even to sell yourselves, if ye ought to become slaves instead of free women, that
so ye might be able to be with that Bridegroom, to enjoy that Beauty, <del>nay</del> merely to look
on that Countenance, ought you not with ready mind to welcome all things? We look at
and admire a king upon the earth, but when <del>we see</del> a king and a bridegroom both, much
more ought we to welcome him with readiness. Truly these things are a shadow, while those
are a reality. And a King and a Bridegroom in Heaven! To be counted worthy also to go
before Him with torches, and to be near Him, and to be ever with Him, what ought we not
to do? What should we not perform? What should we not endure? I entreat you, let us
conceive some desire for those blessings, let us long for that Bridegroom, let us be virgins
as to the true Virginity. For the Lord seeks after the virginity of the soul. With this let us
enter into Heaven, “not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing” ( Eph. v. 27 ); that we
may attain also to the good things promised, of which may we all be partakers through the
grace and mercy of Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom to the Father together with the Holy
Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXIX.</head>
<p>Hebrews xii. 4–6</p>
<p>“Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And ye have forgotten the exhortation
which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the
Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth:
and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”3374</p>
<p><del>1.</del> There are two kinds of consolation, apparently opposed to one another, but yet
contributing great strength each to the other; both of which he has here put forward. The
one is when we say that persons have suffered much: for the soul is refreshed, when it has
many witnesses of its own sufferings, and this he introduced above, saying, “Call to mind
the former days, in which after ye had been illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions.”
( c. x. 32.) The other is when we say, “Thou hast suffered no great thing.” The former, when
<del>the soul</del> has been exhausted refreshes it, and makes it recover breath: the latter, when it
has become indolent and supine, turns it again3375 and pulls down pride. Thus that no pride
may spring up in them from that testimony <del>to their sufferings</del>, see what he does. “Ye have
not yet” (he says) “resisted unto blood, <del>striving</del> against sin.” And he did not at once go on
with what follows, but after having shown them all those who had stood “unto blood,” and
then brought in the glory of Christ, His sufferings,3376 he afterwards easily pursued his
discourse. This he says also in writing to the Corinthians, “There hath no temptation taken
you, but such as is common to man” ( 1 Cor. x. 13 ), that is, small. For this is enough to
arouse and set right the soul, when it considers that it has not risen to the whole <del>trial</del>, and
encourages itself from what has already befallen it.</p>
<p>What he means is this: Ye have not yet submitted to death; your loss has extended to
money, to reputation, to being driven from place to place. Christ however shed His blood
for you, while you have not <del>done it</del> for yourselves. He contended for the Truth even unto
death fighting for you; while ye have not yet entered upon dangers that threaten death.</p>
<p>“And ye have forgotten the exhortation.” That is, And ye have slackened your hands,
ye have become faint. “Ye have not yet,” he said, “resisted unto blood, striving against sin.”
Here he indicates that sin is both very vigorous,3377 and is itself armed. For the <del>expression</del>
“Ye have resisted <del>stood firm against</del>,” is used with reference to those who stand firm.3378</p>
<note type="footnote">3374 or, “accepteth.”</note>

<pb n="937"/>
<p><del>2.</del> “Which” (he says) “speaketh unto you as unto sons, My son, despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him.” He has drawn his encouragement
from the facts themselves; over and above he adds also that which is drawn from
arguments, from this testimony.</p>
<p>“Faint not” (he says) “when thou art rebuked of Him.” It follows that these things are
of God. For this too is no small matter of consolation, when we learn that it is God’s work
that such things have power,3379 He allowing <del>them</del>; even as also Paul says; “He said unto
me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” ( 2 Cor.
xii. 9.) He it is who allows <del>them</del>.</p>
<p>“For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”
Thou canst not say that any righteous man is without affliction: even if he appear to be so,
yet we know not his other afflictions. So that of necessity every righteous man must pass
through affliction. For it is a declaration of Christ, that the wide and broad way leads to
destruction, but the strait and narrow one to life. ( Matt. vii. 13, 14 .) If then it is possible to
enter into life by that means, and is not by any other, then all have entered in by the narrow
<del>way</del>, as many as have departed unto life.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. “Ye endure chastisement”3380 (he says); not for punishment, nor for vengeance,
nor for suffering. See, from that from which they supposed they had been deserted <del>of God</del>,
from these he says they may be confident, that they have not been deserted. It is as if he had
said, Because ye have suffered so many evils, do you suppose that God has left you and hates
you? If ye did not suffer, then it were right to suppose this. For if “He scourgeth every son
whom He receiveth,” he who is not scourged, perhaps is not a son. What then, you say, do
not bad men suffer distress? They suffer indeed; how then? He did not say, Every one who
is scourged is a son, but every son is scourged. For in all cases He scourges His son: what is
wanted then is to show, whether any son is not scourged. But thou wouldest not be able to
say: there are many wicked men also who are scourged, such as murderers, robbers, sorcerers,
plunderers of tombs. These however are paying the penalty of their own wickedness, and
are not scourged as sons, but punished as wicked: but ye as sons.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Then again <del>he argues</del> from the general custom. Seest thou how he brings up arguments
from all quarters, from facts in the Scripture, from its words, from our own notions,
from examples in ordinary life? ( Ver. 8.) “But if ye be without chastisement” <del>U+0026c. </del>. Seest
thou that he said what I just mentioned, that it is not possible to be a son without being
chastened? For as in families, fathers care not for bastards, though they learn nothing, though
they be not distinguished, but fear for their legitimate sons lest they should be indolent, <del>so</del>
<note type="footnote">3379 τὸ τοιαῦτα δυνηθ ΣΨΜΒΟΛ 210 \φ ̈ΣΙΛ Γαλατια̈ \σ 12 ναι</note>
<note type="footnote">3380 εἰς παιδείαν εἰς παιδείαν ὑπομένετε is the reading of the best mss. U+0026c. of St. Chrys. as it is the approved

<pb n="938"/>
<del>here.</del>. If then not to be chastised is <del>a mark</del> of bastards, we ought to rejoice at chastisement,
if this be <del>a sign</del> of legitimacy. “God dealeth with you as with sons”; for this very cause.</p>
<p>Ver. 9. “Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave
them reverence.” Again, <del>he reasons</del> from their own experiences, from what they themselves
suffered. For as he says above, “Call to mind the former days” ( c. x. 32 ), so here also “God”
(he saith) “dealeth with you as with sons,” and ye could not say, We cannot bear it: yea, “as
with sons” tenderly beloved. For if they reverence their “fathers of the flesh,” how shall not
you reverence your heavenly Father?</p>
<p>However the difference arises not from this alone, nor from the persons, but also from
the cause itself, and from the fact. For it is not on the same grounds that He and they inflict
chastisement: but they <del>did it</del> with a view to “what seemed good to them,” that is, fulfilling
<del>their own</del> pleasure oftentimes, and not always looking to what was expedient. But here,
that cannot be said. For He does this not for any interest of His own but for you, and for
your benefit alone. They <del>did it</del> that ye might be useful to themselves also, oftentimes
without reason; but here there is nothing of this kind. Seest thou that this also brings consolation?
For we are most closely attached to those <del>earthly parents</del>, when we see that not
for any interests of their own they either command or advise us: but their earnestness is,
wholly and solely, on our account. For this is genuine love, and love in reality, when we are
beloved though we be of no use to him who loves us,—not that he may receive, but that he
may impart. He chastens, He does everything, He uses all diligence, that we may become
capable of receiving His benefits. ( Ver. 10.) “For they verily” (he says) “for a few days
chastened us after their own pleasure, but He for our profit, that we might be partakers of
His holiness.”</p>
<p>What is “of his holiness”? It is, of His purity, so as to become worthy of Him, according
to our power. He earnestly desires that ye may receive, and He does all that He may give
you: do ye not earnestly endeavor that ye may receive? “I said unto the Lord” (one says)
“Thou art my Lord, for of my good things Thou hast no need.” ( Ps. xvi. 2.)</p>
<p>“Furthermore,” he saith, “we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we
gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and
live?” (“To the Father of spirits,” whether of spiritual gifts, or of prayers, or of the incorporeal
powers.) If we die thus, then “we shall live. For they indeed for a few days chastened us after
their own pleasure,” for what seems <del>so</del> is not always profitable, but “He for our profit.”</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Therefore chastisement is “profitable”; therefore chastisement is a “participation
of holiness.” Yea and this greatly: for when it casts out sloth, and evil desire, and love of the
things of this life, when it helps the soul, when it causes a light esteem of all things here (for
affliction <del>does</del> this), is it not holy? Does it not draw down the grace of the Spirit?</p>
<p>Let us consider the righteous, from what cause they all shone brightly forth. Was it not
from affliction? And, if you will, let us enumerate them from the first and from the very

beginning: Abel, Noah himself; for it is not possible that he, being the only one in that so
great multitude of the wicked, should not have been afflicted; for it is said, “Noah being”
alone “perfect in his generation, pleased God.” ( Gen. vi. 9.) For consider, I beseech you, if
now, when we have innumerable persons whose virtue we may emulate, fathers, and children,
and teachers, we are thus distressed, what must we suppose he suffered, alone among so
many? But should I speak of the circumstances of that strange and wonderful rain? Or
should I speak of Abraham, his wanderings one upon another, the carrying away of his wife,
the dangers, the wars, the famines? Should I speak of Isaac,3381 what fearful things he underwent,
driven from every place, and laboring in vain, and toiling for others? Or of Jacob?
for indeed to enumerate all his <del>afflictions</del> is not necessary, but it is reasonable to bring
forward the testimony, which he himself <del>gave</del> when speaking with Pharaoh; “Few and evil
are my days, and they have not attained to the days of my fathers.” ( Gen. xlvii. 9.) Or should
I speak of Joseph himself? Or of Moses? Or of Joshua? Or of David? Or of Elijah? Or of
Samuel? Or wouldest thou <del>that I speak</del> of all the prophets? Wilt thou not find that all these
were made illustrious from their afflictions? Tell me then, dost thou desire to become illustrious
from ease and luxury? But thou canst not.</p>
<p>Or should I speak of the Apostles? Nay but they went beyond all. And Christ said this,
“In the world ye shall have tribulation.” ( John xvi. 33.) And again, “Ye shall weep and
lament, but the world shall rejoice.” ( John xvi. 20.) And, that “Strait and narrow is the
way3382 that leadeth unto life.” ( Matt. vii. 14.) The Lord of the way said, that it is “narrow
and strait”; and dost thou seek the “broad” [way]? How is this not unreasonable? In consequence
thou wilt not arrive at life, going another [way], but at destruction, for thou hast
chosen the <del>path</del> which leads thither.</p>
<p>Wouldst thou that I bring before you those <del>that live</del> in luxury? Let us ascend from the
last to the first. The rich man who is burning in the furnace; the Jews who live for the belly,
“whose god is their belly” ( Phil. iii. 19 ), who were ever seeking ease in the wilderness, were
destroyed; as also those in Sodom, on account of their gluttony; and those in the time of
Noah, was it not because they chose this soft and dissolute life? For “they luxuriated,” it
says, “in fullness of bread.” ( Ezek. xvi. 49.) It speaks of those in Sodom. But if “fullness of
bread” wrought so great evil, what should we say of other delicacies? Esau, was not he in
ease? And what of those who being of “the sons of God” ( Gen. vi. 2 ), looked on women,
and were borne down the precipice? And what of those who were maddened by inordinate

lust? and all the kings of the nations, of the Babylonians, of the Egyptians, did they not
perish miserably? Are they not in torment?</p>
<p><del>5.</del> And as to things now, tell me, are they not the same? Hear Christ saying, “They that
wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses” ( Matt. xi. 8 ), but they who do not <del>wear</del> such
things, are in Heaven. For the soft garment relaxes even the austere soul, breaks it and enervates
it: yea, even if it meet with a body rough and hard, it speedily by such delicate treatment
makes it soft and weak.</p>
<p>For, tell me, for what other reason do you suppose women are so weak? Is it from their
sex only? By no means: but from their way of living, and their bringing up. For their avoiding
exposure,3383 their inactivity, their baths, their unguents, their multitude of perfumes, the
delicate softness of their couches, makes them in the end such as they are.</p>
<p>And that thou mayest understand, attend to what I say. Tell me; take from a garden a
tree from those standing in the uncultivated3384 part and beaten by the winds, and plant it
in a moist and shady place, and thou wilt find it very unworthy of that from which thou
didst originally take it. And that this is true, <del>appears from the fact that</del> women brought
up in the country are stronger than citizens of towns: and they would overcome many such
in wrestling. For when the body becomes more effeminate, of necessity the soul also shares
the mischief, since, for the most part, its energies are affected in accordance with the <del>body</del>.
For in illness we are different persons owing to weakness, and when we become well, we
are different again. For as in the case of a string when the tones3385 are weak and relaxed,
and not well arranged, the excellence of the art is also destroyed, being obliged to serve the
ill condition of the strings: so in the case of the body also, the soul receives from it many
hurts, many necessities.3386 For when it needs much nursing, the other endures a bitter
servitude.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Wherefore, I beseech you, let us make it strong by work, and not nurse it as an invalid.
3387 My discourse is not to men only but to women also. For why dost thou, O woman,
continually enfeeble3388 <del>thy body</del> with luxury and exhaust it?3389 Why dost thou ruin thy
strength with fat? This fat is flabbiness, not strength. Whereas, if thou break off from these
things, and manage thyself differently, then will thy personal beauty also improve according
to thy wish, when strength and a good habit of body are there. If however thou beset it with

ten thousand diseases, there will neither be bloom of complexion, nor good health; for thou
wilt always be in low spirits. And you know that as when the air is smiling it makes a beautiful
house look splendid, so also cheerfulness of mind when added to a fair countenance,
makes it better: but if <del>a woman</del> is in low spirits and in pain she becomes more ill-looking.
But diseases and pains produce low spirits; and diseases are produced from the body too
delicate through great luxury. So that even for this you will flee luxury, if you take my advice.</p>
<p>‘But, you will say, luxury gives pleasure.’ Yes, but not so great as the annoyances. And
besides, the pleasure goes no further than the palate and the tongue. For when the table has
been removed, and the food swallowed, thou wilt be like one that has not partaken, or rather
much worse, in that thou bearest thence oppression, and distension, and headache, and a
sleep like death, and often too, sleeplessness from repletion, and obstruction of the breathing,
and eructation. And thou wouldest curse bitterly thy belly, when thou oughtest to curse thy
immoderate eating.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us not then fatten the body, but listen to Paul saying, “Make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof,” ( Rom. xiii. 14.) As if one should take food and throw
it into a drain, so is he who throws it into the belly: or rather it is not so, but much worse.
For in the one case he uses3390 the drain without harm to himself: but in the other he generates
innumerable diseases. For what nourishes is a sufficiency which also can be digested:
but what is over and above our need, not only does not nourish, but even spoils the other.
But no man sees these things, owing to some prejudice and unseasonable pleasure.</p>
<p>Dost thou wish to nourish the body? Take away what is superfluous; give what is sufficient,
and as much as can be digested. Do not load it, lest thou overwhelm it. A sufficiency
is both nourishment and pleasure. For nothing is so productive of pleasure, as food well
digested: nothing so <del>productive of</del> health: nothing <del>so productive of</del> acuteness of the
faculties, nothing tends so much to keep away disease. For a sufficiency is both nourishment,
and pleasure, and health; but excess is injury, and unpleasantness and disease. For what
famine does, that also satiety does; or rather more grievous evils. For the former indeed
within a few days carries a man off and sets him free; but the other eating into and putrefying
the body, gives it over to long disease, and then to a most painful death. But we, while we
account famine a thing greatly to be dreaded, yet run after satiety, which is more distressing
than that.</p>
<p>Whence is this disease? Whence this madness? I do not say that we should waste ourselves
away, but that we should eat as much food as also gives us pleasure, that is really pleasure,
and can nourish the body, and furnish it to us well ordered and adapted for the energies of
the soul, well joined and fitted together. But when it comes to be water-logged3391 by luxury,
<note type="footnote">3390 ἐ ργάζεται</note>
<note type="footnote">3391 ὑ πέραντλον</note>

<pb n="942"/>
it cannot in the flood-wave, keep fast the bolts3392 themselves, as one may say, and joints
which hold the frame together. For the flood-wave coming in, the whole breaks up and
scatters.</p>
<p>“Make not provision for the flesh” (he says) “to fulfill the lusts thereof.” ( Rom. xiii. 14.)
He said well. For luxury is fuel for unreasonable lusts; though the luxurious should be the
most philosophical of all men, of necessity he must be somewhat affected by wine, by eating,
he must needs be relaxed, he must needs endure the greater flame. Hence <del>come</del> fornications,
hence adulteries. For a hungry belly cannot generate lust, or rather not one which has used
just enough. But that which generates unseemly lusts, is that which is relaxed3393 by luxury.
And as land which is very moist and a dung-hill which is wet through and retains much
dampness, generates worms, while that which has been freed from such moistness bears
abundant fruits, when it has nothing immoderate: even if it be not cultivated, it yields grass,
and if it be cultivated, fruits: <del>so also do we</del>.</p>
<p>Let us not then make our flesh useless, or unprofitable, or hurtful, but let us plant in it
useful fruits, and fruit-bearing trees; let us not enfeeble them by luxury, for they too put
forth worms instead of fruit when they are become rotten. So also implanted desire, if thou
moisten it above measure, generates unreasonable pleasures, yea the most exceedingly unreasonable.
Let us then remove this pernicious evil, that we may be able to attain the good
things promised us, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father, together with the
Holy Spirit, be glory now and ever and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xii. 11–13</p>
<p>“No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous,3394 but grievous,3395 nevertheless, afterward
it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are3396 exercised
thereby. Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees: and make
straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it
rather be healed.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> They who drink bitter medicines, first submit to some unpleasantness, and afterwards
feel the benefit. For such is virtue, such is vice. In the latter there is first the pleasure, then
the despondency: in the former first the despondency, and then the pleasure. But there is
no equality; for it is not the same, to be first grieved and afterwards pleased, and to be first
pleased and afterwards grieved. How so? because in the latter case the expectation of coming
despondency makes the present pleasure less: but in the former the expectation of coming
pleasure cuts away the violence of present despondency; so that the result is that in the one
instance we never have pleasure, in the latter we never have grief. And the difference does
not lie in this only, but also in other ways. As how? That the duration is not equal, but far
greater and more ample. And here too, it is still more so in things spiritual.</p>
<p>From this <del>consideration</del>then Paul undertakes to console them; and again takes up
the common judgment of men, which no one is able to stand against, nor to contend with
the common decision, when one says what is acknowledged by all.</p>
<p>Ye are suffering, he says. For such is chastisement; such is its beginning. For “no
chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous.” Well said he, “seemeth not.”
Chastisement he means is not grievous but “seemeth” so. “All chastisement”: not this and
that, but “all,” both human and spiritual. Seest thou that he argues from our common notions?
“Seemeth” (he says) “to be grievous,” so that it is not [really so]. For what sort of grief
brings forth joy? So neither does pleasure bring forth despondency.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them which
have been exercised thereby.” Not “fruit” but “fruits,”3397 a great abundance.</p>
<note type="footnote">3394 “of joy.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3395 “of grief.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3396 [The Revision has here correctly “have been exercised,” and it is so commented upon by St. Chrys. below.—

commented upon as if in the plural.—F.G.]</note>

<pb n="944"/>
<p>“To them” (he says) “which have been exercised thereby.” What is “to them which have
been exercised thereby”? To them that have endured for a long while, and been patient. And
he uses an auspicious3398 expression. So then, chastisement is exercise, making the athlete
strong, and invincible in combats, irresistible in wars.</p>
<p>If then “all chastisement” be such, this also will be such: so that we ought to look for
good things, and for a sweet and peaceful end. And do not wonder if, being itself hard, it
has sweet fruits; since in trees also the bark is almost destitute of all quality,3399 and rough;
but the fruits are sweet. But he took it from the common notion. If therefore we ought to
look for such things, why do ye vex yourselves? Why, after ye have endured the painful, do
ye despond as to the good? The distasteful things which ye had to endure, ye endured: do
not then despond as to the recompense.</p>
<p>He speaks as to runners, and boxers, and warriors.3400 Seest thou how he arms them,
how he encourages them? “Walk straight,” he says. Here he speaks with reference to their
thoughts; that is to say, not doubting. For if the chastisement be of love, if it begin from
loving care, if it end with a good result (and this he proves both by facts and by words, and
by all considerations), why are ye dispirited? For such are they who despair, who are not
strengthened by the hope of the future. “Walk straight,” he says, that your lameness may
not be increased, but brought back to its former condition. For he that runs when he is lame,
galls the sore place. Seest thou that it is in our power to be thoroughly healed?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 14. “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord.” What he also said above, “Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together”
( c. x. 25 ), he hints at in this place also. For nothing so especially makes persons easily
vanquished and subdued in temptations, as isolation. For, tell me, scatter a phalanx in war,
and the enemy will need no trouble, but will take them prisoners, coming on them separately,
and thereby the more helpless.</p>
<p>“Follow peace with all men, and holiness”3401 (he says). Therefore with the evil-doers
as well? “If it be possible,” he says, “as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.” (
Rom. xii. 18.) For thy part (he means) “live peaceably,” doing no harm to religion: but in
whatever thou art ill-treated, bear it nobly. For the bearing with evil is a great weapon in
trials. Thus Christ also made His disciples strong by saying, “Behold I send you forth as
sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves,” (
<note type="footnote">3398 εὐφήμῳ</note>
<note type="footnote">3399 ἄ ποιος</note>
<note type="footnote">3400 These words refer to ver. 13 , “Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and
make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed,”
which is inserted in the text of the common editions.</note>
<note type="footnote">3401 “the sanctification.” [It is the same word as above and is rendered in the R.V. “the sanctification.” —F.G.]</note>

<pb n="945"/>
Matt. x. 16.) What dost Thou say? Are we “among wolves,” and dost Thou bid us to be “as
sheep,” and “as doves”? Yea, He says. For nothing so shames him that is doing us evil, as
bearing nobly the things which are brought upon us: and not avenging ourselves either by
word or by deed. This both makes us more philosophical ourselves and procures a greater
reward, and also benefits them. But has such an one been insolent? Do thou bless <del>him</del>.
See how much thou wilt gain from this: thou hast quenched the evil, thou hast procured to
thyself a reward, thou hast made him ashamed, and thou hast suffered nothing serious.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> “Follow peace with all men, and holiness.” What does he mean by “holiness”3402 ?
Chaste, and orderly living in marriage. If any person is unmarried (he says) let him remain
pure, let him marry: or if he be married, let him not commit fornication, but let him live
with his own wife: for this also is “holiness.” How? Marriage is not “holiness,” but marriage
preserves the holiness which [proceeds] from Faith, not permitting union with a harlot. For
“marriage is honorable” ( c. xiii. 4 ), not holy. Marriage is pure: it does not however also
give holiness, except by forbidding the defilement of that <del>holiness</del> which has been given
by our Faith.</p>
<p>“Without which” (he says) “no man shall see the Lord.” Which he also says in the
<del>Epistle</del> to the Corinthians. “Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor covetous persons, nor
thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” (
1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.) For how shall he who has become the body of a harlot, how shall he be able
to be the body of Christ?</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 15. “Looking diligently3403 lest any man come short of the grace of God; lest
any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: lest there be
any fornicator or profane person.” Dost thou see how everywhere he puts the common salvation
into the hands of each individual? “Exhorting one another daily” (he says) “while it
is called To-day.” ( c. iii. 13.) Do not then cast all <del>the burden</del> on your teachers; do not
<del>cast</del> all upon them who have the rule over you: ye also (he means) are able to edify one
another. Which also he said in writing to the Thessalonians, “Edify one another, even as
also ye do.” ( 1 Thess. v. 11.) And again, “Comfort one another with these words.” ( 1 Thess.
iv. 18.) This we also now exhort you.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> If ye be willing, ye will have more success with each other than we can have. For ye
both are with one another for a longer time, and ye know more than we of each other’s affairs,
and ye are not ignorant of each other’s failings, and ye have more freedom of speech, and
love, and intimacy; and these are no small <del>advantages</del> for teaching, but great and opportune
introductions for it: ye will be more able than we both to reprove and to exhort. And not
<note type="footnote">3402 “sanctification,” as 1 Thess. iv. 3 , U+0026c. s</note>
<note type="footnote">3403 ἐ πισκοποῦντες</note>

<pb n="946"/>
this only, but because I am but one, whereas ye are many; and ye will be able, however many,
to be teachers. Wherefore I entreat you, do not “neglect this gift.” ( 1 Tim. iv. 14.) Each one
of you has a wife, has a friend, has a servant, has a neighbor; let him reprove him, let him
exhort him.</p>
<p>For how is it not absurd, with regard to <del>bodily</del> nourishment, to make associations for
messing together, and for drinking together, and to have a set day whereon to club with one
another, as they say, and to make up by the association what each person being alone by
himself fails short of—as for instance, if it be necessary to go to a funeral, or to a dinner, or
to assist a neighbor in any matter—and not to do this for the purpose of instruction in virtue?
Yea, I entreat you, let no man neglect it. For great is the reward he receives from God. And
that thou mayest understand, he who was entrusted with the five talents is the teacher: and
he with the one is the learner. If the learner should say, I am a learner, I run no risk, and
should hide the reason,3404 which he received of God, that common and simple <del>reason</del>,
and give no advice, should not speak plainly, should not rebuke, should not admonish, if
he is able, but should bury <del>his talents</del> in the earth (for truly that heart is earth and ashes,
which hides the gift of God): if then he hides it either from indolence, or from wickedness,
it will be no defense to him to say, ‘I had but one talent.’ Thou hadst one talent. Thou
oughtest then to have brought one besides, and to have doubled the talent. If thou hadst
brought one in addition, thou wouldst not have been blamed. For neither did He say to him
who brought the two, Wherefore hast thou not brought five? But He accounted him of the
same worth with him who brought the five. Why? Because he gained as much as he had.
And, because he had received fewer than the one entrusted with the five, he was not on this
account negligent, nor did he use the smallness <del>of his trust, as an excuse</del> for idleness. And
thou oughtest not to have looked to him who had the two; or rather, thou oughtest to have
looked to him, and as he having two imitated him who had five, so oughtest thou to have
emulated him who had two. For if for him who has means and does not give, there is punishment,
how shall there not be the greatest punishment for him who is able to exhort in
any way, and does it not? In the former case the body is nourished, in the latter the soul;
there thou preventest temporal death, here eternal.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> But I have no <del>skill of</del> speech,3405 you say. But there is no need of [skill of] speech
nor of eloquence. If thou see a friend going into fornication, say to him, Thou art going after
an evil thing; art thou not ashamed? Dost thou not blush? This is wrong. ‘Why, does he not
know’ (you say) ‘that it is wrong?’ Yes, but he is dragged on by lust. They that are sick also
know that it is bad to drink cold water, nevertheless they need persons who shall hinder
<del>them from it</del>. For he who is suffering, will not easily be able to help himself in his sickness.
<note type="footnote">3404 τὸν λόγον, includes “word,” and “doctrine.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3405 λόγου</note>

<pb n="947"/>
There is need therefore of thee who art in health, for his cure. And if he be not persuaded
by thy words, watch for him as he goes away and hold him fast; peradventure he will be
ashamed.</p>
<p>‘And what advantage is it’ (you say), ‘when he does this for my sake, and because he has
been held back by me?’ Do not be too minute in thy calculations. For a while, by whatever
means, withdraw him from his evil practice; let him be accustomed not to go off to that pit,
whether through thee, or through any means whatever. When thou hast accustomed him
not to go, then by taking him after he has gained breath a little thou wilt be able to teach
him that he ought to do this for God’s sake, and not for man’s. Do not wish to make all right
at once, since you cannot: but do it gently and by degrees.</p>
<p>If thou see him going off to drinking, or to parties where there is nothing but drunkenness,
then also do the same; and again on the other hand intreat him, if he observe that thou
hast any failing, to help thee and set thee right. For in this way, he will even of himself, bear
reproof, when he sees both that thou needest reproofs as well, and that thou helpest him,
not as one that had done everything right, nor as a teacher, but as a friend and a brother.
Say to him, I have done thee a service, in reminding thee of things expedient: do thou also,
whatever failing thou seest me have, hold me back,3406 set me right. If thou see me irritable,
if avaricious, restrain me, bind me by exhortation.</p>
<p>This is friendship; thus “brother aided by brother becomes a fortified city.” ( Prov. xviii.
19.) For not eating and drinking makes friendship: such friendship even robbers have and
murderers. But if we are friends, if we truly care for one another, let us in these respects help
one another. This leads us to a profitable friendship: let us hinder those things which lead
away to hell.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Therefore let not him that is reproved be indignant: for we are men and we have
failings; neither let him who reproves do it as exulting over him and making a display, but
privately, with gentleness. He that reproves has need of greater gentleness, that thus he may
persuade [them] to bear the cutting. Do you not see surgeons, when they burn, when they
cut, with how great gentleness they apply their treatment? Much more ought those who reprove
others to act thus. For reproof is sharper even than fire and knife, and makes <del>men</del>
start. On this account surgeons take great pains to make them bear the cutting quietly, and
apply it as tenderly as possible, even giving in3407 a little, then giving time to take breath.</p>
<p>So ought we also to offer reproofs, that the reproved may not start away. Even if therefore,
it be necessary to be insulted, yea even to be struck, let us not decline it. For those also who
are cut [by the surgeons] utter numberless cries against those who are cutting them; they
however heed none of these things, but only the health of the patients. So indeed in this case
<note type="footnote">3406 ἀ ναχαίτισον</note>
<note type="footnote">3407 ἐ νδιδόντες</note>

<pb n="948"/>
also we ought to do all things that our reproof may be effectual, to bear all things, looking
to the reward which is in store.</p>
<p>“Bear ye one another’s burdens,” saith he, “and so fulfill the law of Christ.” ( Gal. vi. 2.)
So then, both reproving and bearing with one another, shall we be able to fulfill edification.
And thus will ye make the labor light for us, in all things taking a part with us, and stretching
out a hand, and becoming sharers and partakers, both in one another’s salvation, and each
one in his own. Let us then endure patiently, both bearing “one another’s burdens,” and
reproving: that we may attain to the good things promised in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXI.</head>
<p>Hebrews xii. 14</p>
<p>“Follow peace with all men, and holiness,3408 without which no one shall see the Lord.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> There are many things characteristic of Christianity: but more than all, and better
than all, Love towards one another, and Peace. Therefore Christ also saith, “My peace I give
unto you.” ( John xiv. 27.) And again, “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples,
if ye love one another.” ( John xiii. 35.) Therefore Paul too says, “Follow peace with all men,
and holiness,” that is, purity,3409 “without which no man shall see the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God.” As if they were traveling together
on some long journey, in a large company, he says, Take heed that no man be left
behind: I do not seek this only, that ye should arrive yourselves, but also that ye should look
diligently after the others.</p>
<p>“Lest any man” (he says) “fail of the grace of God.” (He means the good things to come,
the faith of the gospel, the best course of life: for they all are of “the Grace of God.”) Do not
tell me, It is <del>but</del> one that perisheth. Even for one Christ died. Hast thou no care for him
“for whom Christ died”? ( 1 Cor. viii. 11.)</p>
<p>“Looking diligently,” he saith, that is, searching carefully, considering, thoroughly ascertaining,
as is done in the case of sick persons, and in all ways examining, thoroughly ascertaining.
“Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you.” ( Deut. xxix. 18.) This is
found in Deuteronomy; and he derived it from the metaphor of plants. “Lest any root of
bitterness,” he says; which he said also in another place when he writes, “A little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump.” ( 1 Cor. v. 6.) Not for his sake alone do I wish this, he means,
but also on account of the harm arising therefrom. That is to say, even if there be a root of
this kind, do not suffer any shoot to come up, but let it be cut off, that it may not bear its
proper fruits, that so it may not defile and pollute the others also. For, he saith, “Lest any
root of bitterness springing up trouble you; and by it many be defiled.”</p>
<p>And with good reason did he call sin “bitter”: for truly nothing is more bitter than sin,
and they know it, who after they have committed it pine away under their conscience, who
endure much bitterness. For being exceedingly bitter, it perverts the reasoning faculty itself.
Such is the nature of what is bitter: it is unprofitable.</p>
<p>And well said he, “root of bitterness.” He said not, “bitter,” but “of bitterness.” For it is
possible that a bitter root might bear sweet fruits; but it is not possible that a root and
<note type="footnote">3408 or, “the sanctification.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3409 σεμνότητα, properly a disposition and conduct which creates respect or reverence: so specially (here as
in other places) chastity. See Hom. xxx. [3], above, p. 504.</note>

<pb n="950"/>
fountain and foundation of bitterness, should ever bear sweet fruit; for all is bitter, it has
nothing sweet, all are bitter, all unpleasant, all full of hatred and abomination.</p>
<p>“And by this” (he says) “many be defiled.” That is, Cut off the lascivious persons.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 16. “Lest there be any fornicator: or profane person, as Esau, who for one
morsel of meat sold his birthright.”3410</p>
<p>And wherein was Esau a “fornicator”? He does not say that Esau was a fornicator. “Lest
there be any fornicator,” he says, then, “follow after holiness: lest there be any, as Esau,
profane”: that is, gluttonous, without self-control, worldly, selling away things spiritual.</p>
<p>“Who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright,” who through his own slothfulness
sold this honor which he had from God, and for a little pleasure, lost the greatest honor and
glory. This was suitable to them. This <del>was the conduct</del> of an abominable, of an unclean
person. So that not only is the fornicator unclean, but also the glutton, the slave of his belly.
For he also is a slave of a different pleasure. He is forced to be overreaching, he is forced to
be rapacious, to behave himself unseemly in ten thousand ways, being the slave of that
passion, and oftentimes he blasphemes. So he accounted “his birthright” to be nothing
worth. That is, providing for temporary refreshment, he went even to the <del>sacrifice of his</del>
“birthright.” So henceforth “the birthright” belongs to us, not to the Jews. And at the same
time also this is added to their calamity, that the first is become last, and the second, first:
the one, for courageous endurance; the other last for indolence.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Ver. 17. “For ye know” (he says) “how that afterward, when he would have inherited
the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place of repentance, though he sought it
carefully with tears.” What now is this? Doth he indeed exclude repentance? By no means.
‘But how, you say, was it that “he found no place of repentance”?’ For if he condemned
himself, if he made a great wailing, why did he “find no place of repentance”? Because it
was not really a case of repentance. For as the grief of Cain was not of repentance, and the
murder proved it; so also in this case, his words were not those of repentance, and the murder
afterwards proved it. For even he also in intention slew Jacob. For “The days of mourning
for my father,” he said, “are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.” ( Gen. xxvii. 41.)
“Tears” had not power to give him “repentance.” And [the Apostle] did not say “by repentance”
simply, but even “with tears, he found no place of repentance.” Why now? Because
he did not repent as he ought, for this is repentance; he repented not as it behoved him.</p>
<p>For how is it that he <del>the Apostle</del> said this? How did he exhort them again after they
had become “sluggish” ( c. vi. 12 )? How, when they were become “lame”? How, when they
were “paralyzed”3411 ( ver. 13 )? How, when they were “relaxed”3412 ( ver. 12 )? For this is
<note type="footnote">3410 πρωτοτόκια, “birthright privileges.”</note>

<pb n="951"/>
the beginning of a fall. He seems to me to hint at some fornicators amongst them, but not
to wish at that time to correct them: but feigns ignorance that they might correct themselves.
For it is right at first indeed to pretend ignorance: but afterwards, when they continue <del>in
sin</del>, then to add reproof also, that so they may not become shameless. Which Moses also
did in the case of Zimri and the daughter of Cosbi.</p>
<p>“For he found” (he says) “no place of repentance,” he found not repentance; or that he
sinned beyond3413 repentance. There are then sins beyond repentance. His meaning is, Let
us not fall by an incurable fall. So long as it is a matter of lameness, it is easy to become upright:
but if we turn out of the way, what will be left? For it is to those who have not yet
fallen that he thus discourses, striking them with terror, and says that it is not possible for
him who is fallen to obtain consolation; but to those who have fallen, that they may not fall
into despair, he says the contrary, speaking thus, “My little children, of whom I travail in
birth again, until Christ he formed in you.” ( Gal. iv. 19.) And again, “Whosoever of you
are justified by the Law, are fallen from Grace.” ( Gal. v. 4.) Lo! he testifies that they had
fallen away. For he that standeth, hearing that it is not possible to obtain pardon after having
fallen, will be more zealous, and more cautious about his standing: if however thou use the
same violence towards one also who is fallen, he will never rise again. For by what hope will
he show forth the change?</p>
<p>But he not only wept (you say), but also “sought earnestly.” He does not then exclude
repentance; but makes them careful not to fall.</p>
<p><del>4.</del> As many then as do not believe in Hell, let them call these things to mind: as many
as think to sin without being punished, let them take account of these things. Why did Esau
not obtain pardon? Because he repented not as he ought. Wouldest thou see perfect repentance?
Hear of the repentance of Peter after his denial. For the Evangelist in relating to us
the things concerning him, says, “And he went out and wept bitterly.” ( Matt. xxvi. 75.)
Therefore even such a sin was forgiven him, because he repented as he ought. Although the
Victim had not yet been offered, nor had The Sacrifice as yet been made, nor was sin as yettaken
away, it still had the rule and sovereignty.</p>
<p>And that thou mayest learn, that this denial <del>arose</del> not so much from sloth, as from
His being forsaken of God, who was teaching him to know the measures of man and not to
contradict the sayings of the Master, nor to be more high-minded than the rest, but to know
that nothing can be done without God, and that “Except the Lord build the house, they labor
in vain who build it” ( Ps. cxxvii. 1 ): therefore also Christ said to him alone, “Satan desired
to sift thee as wheat,” and I allowed it not, “that thy faith may not fail.” ( Luke xxii. 31, 32.)
For since it was likely that he would be high-minded, being conscious to himself that he
loved Christ more than they all, therefore “he wept bitterly”; and he did other things after
<note type="footnote">3413 μείζονα, “committed sins too great for repentance.”</note>

<pb n="952"/>
his weeping, of the same character. For what did he do? After this he exposed himself to
dangers innumerable, and by many means showed his manliness and courage.</p>
<p>Judas also repented, but in an evil way: for he hanged himself. Esau too repented; as I
said; or rather, he did not even repent; for his tears were not <del>tears</del> of repentance, but rather
of pride and wrath. And what followed proved this. The blessed David repented, thus saying,
“Every night will I wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.” ( Ps. vi. 6.) And the
sin which had been committed long ago, after so many years, after so many generations he
bewailed, as if it had recently occurred.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> For he who repents ought not to be angry, nor to be fierce, but to be contrite, as
one condemned, as not having boldness, as one on whom sentence has been passed, as one
who ought to be saved by mercy alone, as one who has shown himself ungrateful toward
his Benefactor, as unthankful, as reprobate, as worthy of punishments innumerable. If he
considers these things, he will not be angry, he will not be indignant, but will mourn, will
weep, will groan, and lament night and day.</p>
<p>He that is penitent ought never to forget his sin, but on the one hand, to beseech God
not to remember it; while on the other, he himself never forgets it. If we remember it, God
will forget it. Let us exact punishment from ourselves; let us accuse ourselves; thus shall we
propitiate the Judge. For sin confessed becomes less, but not confessed worse. For if sin add
to itself shamelessness and ingratitude, how will he who does not know that he sinned before
be at all able to guard himself from falling again into the same <del>evils</del>?</p>
<p>Let us then not deny <del>our sins</del>, I beseech you, nor be shameless, that we may not unwillingly
pay the penalty. Cain heard God say, “Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I
know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” ( Gen. iv. 9.) Seest thou how this made his sin more
grievous? But his father did not act thus. What then? When he heard, “Adam, where art
thou?” ( Gen. iii. 9 ), he said, “I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and
I hid myself.” ( Gen. iii. 10.) It is a great good to acknowledge our sins, and to bear them in
mind continually. Nothing so effectually cures a fault, as a continual remembrance of it.
Nothing makes a man so slow to wickedness.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> I know that conscience starts back, and endures not to be scourged by the remembrance
of evil deeds; but hold tight thy soul and place a muzzle on it. For like an ill-broken3414
horse, so it bears impatiently <del>what is put upon it</del>, and is unwilling to persuade itself that
it has sinned: but all this is the work of Satan.3415 But let us persuade it that it has sinned;
let us persuade it that it has sinned, that it may also repent, in order that having repented it
may escape torment. How dost thou think to obtain pardon for thy sins, tell me, when thou
hast not yet confessed them? Assuredly he is worthy of compassion and kindness who has
<note type="footnote">3414 δυσήνιος</note>
<note type="footnote">3415 σατανικόν</note>

<pb n="953"/>
sinned. But thou who hast not yet persuaded thyself <del>that thou hast sinned</del>, how dost thou
think to be pitied, when thou art thus without shame for some things?3416</p>
<p>Let us persuade ourselves that we have sinned. Let us say it not with the tongue only,
but also with the mind. Let us not call ourselves sinners, but also count over our sins, going
over them each specifically.3417 I do not say to thee, Make a parade of thyself, nor accuse
thyself before others: but be persuaded by the prophet when he saith, “Reveal thy way unto
the Lord.” ( Ps. xxxvii. 5.) Confess these things before God. Confess before the Judge thy
sins with prayer; if not with tongue, yet in memory, and be worthy of mercy.</p>
<p>If thou keep thy sins continually in remembrance, thou wilt never bear in mind the
wrongs of thy neighbor. I do not say, if thou art persuaded that thou art thyself a sinner;
this does not avail so to humble the soul, as sins themselves <del>taken</del> by themselves, and examined
specifically.3418 Thou wilt have no remembrance of wrongs <del>done thee</del>, if thou
hast these things continually in remembrance; thou wilt feel no anger, thou wilt not revile,
thou wilt have no high thoughts, thou wilt not fall again into the same <del>sins</del>, thou wilt be
more earnest towards good things.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Seest thou how many excellent <del>effects</del> are produced from the remembrance of
our sins? Let us then write them in our minds. I know that the soul does not endure a recollection
which is so bitter: but let us constrain and force it. It is better that it should be gnawed
with the remembrance now, than at that time with vengeance.</p>
<p>Now, if thou remember them, and continually present them before God (see p. 448),
and pray for them, thou wilt speedily blot them out; but if thou forget them now, thou wilt
then be reminded of them even against thy will, when they are brought out publicly before
the whole world, displayed before all, both friends and enemies, and Angels. For surely He
did not say to David only, “What thou didst secretly, I will make manifest to” ( 2 Sam. xii.
12 ) all, but even to us all. Thou wert afraid of men (he said) and respected them more than
God; and God seeing thee, thou caredst not, but wert ashamed before men. For it says,3419
“the eyes of men, this is their fear.” Therefore thou shalt suffer punishment in that very
point; for I will reprove thee, setting thy sins before the eyes of all. For that this is true, and
that in that day the sins of us all are <del>to be</del> publicly displayed, unless we now do them away
by continual remembrance, hear how cruelty and inhumanity are publicly exposed, “I was
an hungered” (He says) “and ye gave Me no meat.” ( Matt. xxv. 42 .) When are these things
said? Is it in a corner? Is it in a secret place?3420 By no means. When then? “When the Son

of Man shall come in His glory” ( Matt. xxv. 31, 32 ), and “all the nations” are gathered together,
when He has separated the one from the other, then will He speak in the audience
of all, and will “set” them “on His right hand” and “on” His “left” ( Matt. xxv. 33 ): “I was
an hungered and ye gave Me no meat.”</p>
<p>See again the five virgins also, hearing before all, “I know you not.” ( Matt. xxv. 12.) For
the five and five do not set forth the number of five only, but those virgins who are wicked
and cruel and inhuman, and those who are not such. So also he that buried his one talent,
heard before all, even of those who had brought the five and the two, “Thou wicked and
slothful servant.” ( Matt. xxv. 26.) But not by words alone, but by deeds also does He then
convict them: even as the Evangelist also says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”
( John xix. 37.) For the resurrection shall be of all at the same time, of sinners and of the
righteous. At the same time shall He be present to all in the judgment.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Consider therefore who they are who shall then be in dismay, who in grief, who
dragged away to the fire, while the others are crowned. “Come” (He says), “ye blessed of
My Father, inherit the kingdom which hath been prepared for you from the foundation of
the world.” ( Matt. xxv. 34.) And again, “Depart from Me into the fire which hath been
prepared for the devil and his angels.” ( Matt. xxv. 41.)</p>
<p>Let us not merely hear the words but write them also before our sight, and let us imagine
Him to be now present and saying these things, and that we are led away to that fire. What
heart shall we have? What consolation? And what, when we are cut asunder? And what
when we are accused of rapacity? What excuse shall we have to utter? What specious argument?
None: but of necessity bound, bending down, we must be dragged to the mouths of
the furnace, to the river of fire, to the darkness, to then ever-dying punishments, and entreat
no one. For it is not, it is not possible, He says, to pass across from this side to that: for “there
is a great gulf betwixt us and you” ( Luke xvi. 26 ), and it is not possible even for those who
wish it to go across, and stretch out a helping hand: but we must needs burn continually,
no one aiding us, even should it be father or mother, or any whosoever, yea though he have
much boldness toward God. For, it says, “A brother doth not redeem; shall man redeem?”
( Ps. xlix. 8.)</p>
<p>Since then it is not possible to have one’s hopes of salvation in another, but <del>it must be</del>
in one’s self after the lovingkindness of God, let us do all things, I entreat you, so that our
conduct may be pure, and our course of life the best, and that it may not receive any stain
even from the beginning. But if not, at all events, let us not sleep after the stain, but continue
always washing away the pollution by repentance, by tears, by prayers, by works of mercy.</p>
<p>What then, you say, if I cannot do works of mercy?3421 But thou hast “a cup of cold
water” ( Matt. x. 42 ), however poor thou art. But thou hast “two mites” ( Mark xii. 42 ), in
<note type="footnote">3421 ἐ λετημοσύνην ἐργάζεσθαι</note>

<pb n="955"/>
whatever poverty thou art; but thou hast feet, so as to visit the sick, so as to enter into a
prison; but thou hast a roof, so as to receive strangers. For there is no pardon, no, none for
him who does not do works of mercy.</p>
<p>These things we say to you continually, that we may effect if it be but a little by the
continued repetition: these things we say, not caring so much for those who receive the benefits,
as for yourselves. For ye give to them indeed things here, but in return you receive
heavenly things: which may we all obtain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the
Father be glory, together with the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xii. 18–24</p>
<p>“For ye are not come unto a fire3422 that might be touched and that burned, and unto blackness,
and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which
voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more.3423
(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch
the mountain, it shall be stoned.3424 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly
fear and quake.) But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the

<p><del>1.</del> Wonderful indeed were the things in the Temple, the Holy of Holies; and again
awful were those things also that were done at Mount Sina, “the fire, the darkness, the
blackness, the tempest.” (Cf. Deut. xxxiii. 2.) For, it says, “God appeared in Sina,” and long
ago were these things celebrated.3427 The New Covenant, however, was not given with any
of these things, but has been given in simple discourse by God.3428</p>
<p>See then how he makes the comparison in these points also. And with good reason has
he put them afterwards. For when he had persuaded them by innumerable <del>arguments</del>,
when he had also shown the difference between each covenant, then afterwards, the one
having been already condemned, he easily enters on these points also.</p>

<p>And what says he? “For ye are not come unto a fire that might be touched, and that
burned, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and
the voice of words; which they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to
them any more.”</p>
<p>These things, he means, are terrible; and so terrible that they could not even bear to
hear them, that not even “a beast” dared to go up. (But things that come hereafter3429 are
not such. For what is Sina to Heaven? And what the “fire which might be touched” to God
who cannot be touched? For “God is a consuming fire.”— c. v. 29.) For it is said, “Let not
God speak, but let Moses speak unto us. And so fearful was that which was commanded,
Though even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned; Moses said, I exceedingly fear
and quake.” ( Ex. xx. 19 .) What wonder as respects the people? He himself who entered
into “the darkness where God was,” saith, “I exceedingly fear and quake.” ( Ex. xx. 21.)</p>
<p><del>2.</del> “But ye are come unto Mount Sion and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem: and to an innumerable company of angels and to the general assembly and
Church of the first-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to
the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and
to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better <del>things</del> than that of Abel.”</p>
<p>Instead of “Moses,” Jesus. Instead of the people, “myriads of angels.”</p>
<p>Of what “first-born” does he speak? Of the faithful.</p>
<p>“And to the spirits of just men made perfect.” With these shall ye be, he says.</p>
<p>“And to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that
speaketh better <del>things</del> than that of Abel.” Did then the <del>blood</del> “of Abel” speak? “Yea,” he
saith, “and by it he being dead yet speaketh.” ( c. xi. 4.) And again God says, “The voice of
thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me.” ( Gen. iv. 10.) Either this <del>meaning</del> or that; because
it is still even now celebrated: but not in such way as that of Christ. For this has cleansed all
men, and sends forth a voice more clear and more distinct, in proportion as it has greater
testimony, namely that by facts.</p>
<p>Ver. 25–29. “See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh. For if they escaped not, who refused
him that spake3430 on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from
Him that speaketh from heaven. Whose voice then shook the earth: but now hath He
promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word,
Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are
made, that those which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom

which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we3431 serve God acceptably with reverence
and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.”</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Fearful were those things, but these are far more admirable and glorious. For here
there is not “darkness,” nor “blackness,” nor “tempest.” It seems to me that by these words
he hints at the obscurity of the Old <del>Testament</del>, and the overshadowed and veiled3432
character of the Law. And besides the Giver of the Law appears in fire terrible, and apt to
punish those who transgress.</p>
<p>But what are “the sounds of the trumpet”? Probably it is as though some King were
coming. This at all events will also be at the second coming. “At the last trump” ( 1 Cor. xv.
52 ) all must be raised. But it is the trumpet of His voice which effects this. At that time then
all things were objects of sense, and sights, and sounds; now all are objects of understanding,
and invisible.</p>
<p>And, it says, “there was much smoke.” (See Ex. xix. 18.) For since God is said to be fire,
and appeared thus in the bush, He indicates the fire even by the smoke. And what is “the
blackness and the darkness”? He again expresses its fearfulness. Thus Isaiah also says; “And
the house was filled with smoke.” ( Isa. vi. 4.) And what is the object of “the tempest”? The
human race was careless. It was therefore needful that they should be aroused by these
things. For no one was so dull as not to have had his thoughts raised up, when these things
were done, and the Law ordained.3433</p>
<p>“Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice” ( Ex. xix. 19 ):3434 for it was necessary
that the voice of God should be uttered. Inasmuch as He was about to promulgate His Law
through Moses, therefore He makes him worthy of confidence. They saw him not, because
of the thick darkness: they heard him not, because of the weakness of his voice. What then?
“God answered by a voice,” addressing the multitude:3435 yea and his name shall be called.3436</p>
<p>“They entreated” (he says) “that the word should not be spoken to them any more.”3437</p>

through the Flesh.3438 Let Moses speak with us, and “Let not God speak with us.” ( Ex. xx.

9.) They who make comparisons elevate the one side the more, that they may show the
other to be far greater. In this respect also our <del>privileges</del>3439 are more gentle and more
admirable. For they are great in a twofold respect: because while they are glorious and
greater, they are more accessible. This he says also in the Epistle to the Corinthians: “with
unveiled countenance” ( 2 Cor. iii. 18 ), and, “not as Moses put a veil over his face.” ( 2 Cor.
iii. 13.) They, he means, were not counted worthy of what we <del>are</del>. For of what were they
thought worthy? They saw “darkness, blackness”; they heard “a voice.” But thou also hast
heard a voice, not through darkness, but through flesh. Thou hast not been disturbed, neither
troubled, but thou hast stood and held discourse with the Mediator.</p>
<p>And in another way, by the “darkness” he shows the invisibleness.3440 “And darkness”

<note type="footnote">3441 This passage, Mr. Field observes, is difficult and probably corrupt. St. Chrysostom seems to mean, that
we are like the people in that we are still here below, not in heaven: for they were “below” only in the sense of
being below in reference to the mountain and heaven to which Moses had been called up. At the same time as
being sons of God we are near to Him with a special nearness—a spiritual and so most intimate nearness—of
the soul, not like that bodily nearness with which Moses was called to draw near. If, however, “the Son” be
understood of the Only-Begotten, it may be supposed that there is some latent connection of thought, as, that
in His nearness His people also are brought near to the Father in a manner far more intimate than was granted
to Moses.</note>

<p>“And to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant: and to the blood of sprinkling,” that
is, of purification, “which speaketh better things than that of Abel.” And if the blood speaks,
much more does He who, having been slain, lives. But what does it speak? “The Spirit also”
(he says) “speaketh with groanings which cannot be uttered.” ( Rom. viii. 26.) How does He
speak? Whenever He falls into a sincere mind, He raises it up and makes it speak.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> “See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh”; that is, that ye reject3442 [Him] not. “For
if they escaped not who refused Him that spake3443 on earth.” Whom does he mean? Moses,
I suppose. But what he says is this: if they, having “refused Him” when He gave laws “on
earth, did not escape,” how shall we refuse Him, when He gives laws from Heaven? He declares
here not that He is another; far from it. He does not set forth One and Another, but
He appears terrible, when uttering His Voice “from Heaven.”3444 It is He Himself then,
both the one and the other: but the One is terrible. For he expresses not a difference of
Persons but of the gift. Whence does this appear? “For if they escaped not,” he says, “who
refused Him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from Him
that speaketh from heaven.” What then? Is this one different from the other? How then does
he say, “whose voice then shook the earth”? For it was the “voice” of Him who “then” gave
the Law, which “shook the earth. But now hath He promised, saying, Yet once more I shake
not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word Yet once more, signifieth the removing
of those things which are shaken, as of things that are made.” All things therefore will be
taken away, and will be compacted anew for the better. For this is what he suggests here.
Why then dost thou grieve when thou sufferest in a world that abideth not; when thou art
afflicted in a world which will very shortly have passed away? If our rest were [to be] in the
latter period of the world, then one ought to be afflicted in looking to the end.</p>

things which cannot be shaken”? The things to come.</p>

would fall, but such a city not at all, wouldest thou have built in that which was about to

be destroyed. But why do I say, It will fall? Before its fall we shall be destroyed, and suffer
what is fearful; we shall be removed from them.</p>
<p>Why build we upon the sand? Let us build upon the rock: for whatsoever may happen,
that building remains impregnable, nothing will be able to destroy it. With good reason.
For to all such attacks that region is inaccessible, just as this is accessible. For earthquakes,
and fires, and inroad of enemies, take it away from us even while we are alive: and oftentimes
destroy us with it.</p>
<p>And even in case it remains, disease speedily removes us, or if we stay, suffers us not to
enjoy it fairly. For what pleasure <del>is there</del>, where there are sicknesses, and false accusations,
and envy, and intrigues? Or should there be none of these things, yet oftentimes if we have
no children, we are disquieted, we are impatient, not having any to whom we may leave
houses and all other things; and thenceforward we pine away as laboring for others. Yea
oftentimes too the inheritance passes away to our enemies, not only after we are gone, but
even while we live. What is more miserable then than to toil for enemies, and ourselves to
be gathering sins together in order that they may have rest? And many are the instances of
this that are seen in our cities. And yet <del>I say no more</del> lest I should grieve those who have
been despoiled. For I could have mentioned some of them even by name, and have had
many histories to tell, and many houses to show you, which have received for masters the
enemies of those who labored for them: nay not houses only, but slaves also and the whole
inheritance have oftentimes come round to enemies. For such are things human.</p>
<p>But in Heaven there is nothing of this to fear,—lest after a man is dead, his enemy should
come, and succeed to his inheritance. For there there is neither death nor enmity; the tabernacles
of the saints are permanent abodes; and among those saints is exultation, joy, gladness.
For “the voice of rejoicing” (it is said) is “in the tabernacles of the righteous.” ( Ps. cxviii.
15.) They are eternal, having no end. They do not fall down through age, they do not change
their owners, but stand continually in their best estate. With good reason. For there is
nothing corruptible, nor perishable there, but all is immortal, and undefiled. On this
building let us exhaust all our wealth. We have no need of carpenters nor of laborers. The
hands of the poor build such houses; the lame, the blind, the maimed, they build those
houses. And wonder not, since they procure even a kingdom for us, and give us confidence
towards God.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> For mercifulness3445 is as it were a most excellent art, and a protector of those who
labor at it. For it is dear to God, and ever stands near Him readily asking favor for whomsoever
it will, if only it be not wronged by us; And it is wronged, when we do it by extortion.
(See p. 481.) So, if it be pure, it gives great confidence to those who offer it up. It intercedes
even for those who have offended, so great is its power, even for those who have sinned. It

breaks the chains, disperses the darkness, quenches the fire, kills the worm, drives away the
gnashing of teeth. The gates of heaven open to it with great security: And as when a Queen
is entering, no one of the guards stationed at the doors dares to inquire who she is, and
whence, but all straightway receive her; so also indeed with mercifulness. For she is truly a
queen indeed, making men like God. For, he says, “ye shall be merciful, as your Heavenly
Father is merciful.” ( Luke vi. 36 .)</p>
<p>She is winged and buoyant, having golden pinions, with a flight which greatly delights
the angels. There, it is said, are “the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her back with
the yellowness of gold.” ( Ps. lxviii. 13.) As some dove golden and living, she flies, with gentle
look, and mild eye. Nothing is better than that eye. The peacock is beautiful, but in comparison
of her, is a jackdaw. So beautiful and worthy of admiration is this bird. She continually
looks upwards; she is surrounded abundantly with God’s glory: she is a virgin with golden
wings, decked out, with a fair and mild countenance. She is winged, and buoyant, standing
by the royal throne. When we are judged, she suddenly flies in, and shows herself, and rescues
us from punishment, sheltering us with her own wings.</p>
<p>God would have her rather than sacrifices. Much does He discourse concerning her: so
He loves her. “He will relieve” (it is said) “the widow” and “the fatherless” ( Ps. cxlvi. 9 ) and
the poor. God wishes to be called from her. “The Lord is pitiful and merciful,3446 long-suffering,
and of great mercy” ( Ps. cxlv. 8 ), and true. The mercy of God is over all the earth.
She hath saved the race of mankind (see Ps. cxlv. 9 ): For unless she had pitied us, all things
would have perished. “When we were enemies” (see Rom. v. 10 ), she “reconciled” us, she
wrought innumerable blessings; she persuaded the Son of God to become a slave, and to
empty Himself <del>of His glory</del>.3447 ( Phil. ii. 7.)</p>
<p>Let us earnestly emulate her by whom we have been saved; let us love her, let us prize
her before wealth, and apart from wealth, let us have a merciful soul. Nothing is so characteristic
of a Christian, as mercy. There is nothing which both unbelievers and all men so
admire, as when we are merciful. For oftentimes we are ourselves also in need of this mercy,
and say to God “Have mercy upon us, after Thy great goodness.” ( Ps. li. 1.) Let us begin
first ourselves: or rather it is not we that begin first. For He has Himself already shown His
mercy towards us: yet at least let us follow second. For if men have mercy on a merciful
man, even if he has done innumerable wrongs, much more does God.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Hear the prophet saying, “But I” (his words are) “am like a fruitful olive tree in the
house of God.” ( Ps. lii. 8.) Let us become such: let us become “as an olive tree”: let us be
laden on every side with the commandments. For it is not enough to be as an olive tree, but
also to be fruitful. For there are persons who in doing alms give little, [only once] in the
<note type="footnote">3446 [ἐ λεήμων akin to ἐ λεημοσύνη, which St. Chrysostom is here describing.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3447 κενῶσαι ἑαυτὸν</note>

<pb n="963"/>
course of the whole year, or in each week, or who give away a mere chance matter. These
are indeed olive trees, but not fruitful ones, but even withered. For because they show
compassion they are olive trees, but because they do it not liberally, they are not fruitful
olive trees. But let us be fruitful.</p>
<p>I have often said and I say now also: the greatness of the charity3448 is not shown by the
measure of what is given, but by the disposition of the giver. You know the case of the widow.
It is well continually to bring this example <del>forward</del>, that not even the poor man may despair
of himself, when he looks on her who threw in the two mites. Some contributed even hair
in the fitting up of the temple, and not even these were rejected. ( Ex. xxxv. 23.) But if when
they had gold, they had brought hair, they <del>would have been</del> accursed: but if, having this
only, they brought it, they were accepted. For this cause Cain also was blamed, not because
he offered worthless things, but because they were the most worthless he had. “Accursed”
(it is said) “is he which hath a male, and sacrificeth unto God a corrupt thing.” ( Mal. i. 14.)
He did not speak absolutely, but, “he that hath” (he says) and spareth <del>it</del>. If then a man
have nothing, he is freed from blame, or rather he has a reward. For what is of less value
than two farthings, or more worthless than hair? What than a pint of meal? But nevertheless
these were approved equally with the calves and the gold. For “a man is accepted according
to that he hath, not according to that he hath not.” ( 2 Cor. viii. 12.) And, it says, “according
as thy hand hath, do good.” ( Prov. iii. 27.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, I entreat you, let us readily empty out what we have for the poor. Even if it
be little we shall receive the same reward with them who have cast the most; or rather, more
than those who cast in ten thousand talents. If we do these things we shall obtain the unspeakable
treasures of God; if we not only hear, but practice also, if we do not praise <del>charity</del>,
but also show <del>it</del> by our deeds. Which may we all attain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Hebrews xii. 28, 29</p>
<p>“Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace <del>or gratitude,</del>3449
whereby we serve3450 God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a
consuming fire.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> In another place he says the same, “for the things which are seen are temporal, but
the things which are not seen are eternal” ( 2. Cor. iv. 18 ); and from this makes an exhortation
with regard to the evils which we endure in this present life; and here he does this, and says,
let us continue steadfast; “let us have thankfulness,” i.e., let us give thanks unto God. For
not only we ought not to be discouraged at present things, but even to show the greatest
gratitude to Him, for those to come.</p>
<p>“Whereby we serve God acceptably,” that is to say, ‘for thus is it possible to serve God
acceptably,’ by giving him thanks in all things. “Do all things” (he says) “without murmurings
and disputings.” ( Phil. ii. 14.) For whatever work a man does with murmuring, he cuts away
and loses his reward; as the Israelites—how great a penalty they paid for their murmurings.
Wherefore he says, “Neither murmur ye.” ( 1 Cor. x. 10.) It is not therefore possible to
“serve” Him “acceptably” without a sense of gratitude to Him for all things, both for our
trials, and the alleviations of them. That is, let us utter nothing hasty, nothing disrespectful,
but let us humble ourselves that we may be reverential. For this is “with reverence and godly
fear.”</p>
<p>C. xiii. 1, 2. “Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful of hospitality,3451 for hereby
some have entertained angels unawares.” See how he enjoins them to preserve what they
had: he does not add other things. He did not say, “Be loving as brethren,” but, “Let brotherly
love continue.” And again, he did not say, “Be hospitable,” as if they were not, but, “Be not
forgetful of hospitality,” for this was likely to happen owing to their afflictions.</p>
<p>Therefore3452 (he says) “some have entertained angels unawares.” Seest thou how great
was the honor, how great the gain!</p>
<p>What is “unawares”?3453 They entertained them without knowing it. Therefore the reward
also was great, because he entertained them, not knowing that they were Angels. For

Lot also.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Ver. 3–5. “Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them, them which
suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body. Marriage is honorable in all,3454 and
the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Let your conversation
be without covetousness: being content with such things as ye have.”</p>
<p>See how large is his discourse concerning chastity. “Follow peace,” he said, “and holiness;
Lest there be any fornicator or profane person” ( c. xii. 14 ); and again, “Fornicators and
adulterers God will judge.” ( c. xii. 16.) In every case, the prohibition is with a penalty.
“Follow peace with all men,” he says, “and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord: But fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”</p>
<p>And having first set down “Marriage is honorable in all men, and the bed undefiled,”
he shows that he rightly added what follows. For if marriage has been conceded, justly is
the fornicator punished, justly does the adulterer suffer vengeance.</p>
<p>Here he strips for3455 the heretics. He did not say again, Let no one be a fornicator; but
having said it once for all, he then went on as with a general exhortation, and not as directing
himself against them.</p>
<p>“Let your conversation be without covetousness,” he says. He did not say, Possess
nothing, but, “Let your conversation be without covetousness”: that is, let it show forth the
philosophical character of your mind.3456 <del>And it will show it, if we do not seek superfluities,
if we keep only to what is necessary.</del>3457 For he says above also, “And ye took joyfully the
spoiling of your goods.” ( c. x. 34.) He gives these exhortations, that they might not be covetous.</p>
<p>“Being content” (he says) “with such things as ye have.” Then here also the consolation;
( ver. 5 ) “For He” (he says) “hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee”; ( ver. 6 )
“so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do
unto me.” Again consolation in their trials.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Ver. 7. “Remember them which have the rule over you.” This he was laboring to
say above: therefore “Follow peace with all men.” ( c. xii. 14.) He gave this exhortation also
to the Thessalonians, to “hold them in honor exceedingly.” ( 1 Thess. v. 13.)</p>
<note type="footnote">3454 [The R.V. puts this and the following clause in the imperative, “Let marriage be had in honor among

<p>“Remember” (he says) “them which have the rule over you,3458 who have spoken unto
you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.” What
kind of following is this? Truly the best: for he says, beholding their life, “follow their faith.”
For from a pure life <del>cometh</del> faith.</p>
<p>Or else by “faith,” he means steadfastness. How so? Because they believe in the things
to come. For they would not have shown forth a pure life, if they had questioned about the
things to come, if they had doubted. So that here also he is applying a remedy to the same
<del>evil</del>.3459</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. “Jesus Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever. Be not carried about
with divers and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established with grace, not
with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.”</p>
<p>In these words, “Jesus Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever,” “yesterday”
means all the time that is past: “to-day,” the present: “for ever,” the endless which is to come.
That is to say: Ye have heard of an High Priest, but not an High Priest who fails. He is always
the same. As though there were some who said, ‘He is not, another will come,’ he says this,
that He who was “yesterday and to-day,” is “the same also for ever.” For even now the Jews
say, that another will come; and having deprived themselves of Him that is will fall into the
hands of Antichrist.</p>
<p>“Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.” Not “with strange doctrines”
only, but neither with “divers ones.”</p>
<p>“For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats which
have not profited them that have been occupied3460 therein.” Here he gently hints at those
who introduce the observance of “meats.” For by Faith all things are pure. There is need
then of Faith, not of “meats.”</p>
<p>For ( ver. 10 ) “we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve3461 the
Tabernacle.” Not as the Jewish <del>ordinances</del>, are those among us, as it is not lawful even for
the High Priest to partake of them. So that since he had said, “Do not observe,”3462 and this
seemed to be <del>the language</del> of one who is throwing down his own building, he again turns
it round. What, have not we then observances as well (he says)? <del>Yea we have</del>, and we observe
them very earnestly too, not sharing them even with the priests themselves.</p>

the type shining forth? “For sin,” he says, and “suffered without the gate.” ( Ver. 13 ) “Let
us go forth therefore to Him without the camp, bearing His reproach,” that is, suffering the
same things; having communion with Him in His sufferings. He was crucified without as
a condemned person: neither let us then be ashamed to “go forth out” <del>of the world</del>.</p>
<p>Ver. 14, 15. “For we have here no continuing city” (he says) “but we seek one to come.

<p>“By Him,” as by an High Priest, according to the flesh.3463 “Giving thanks”3464 (he says)
“to His Name.” (See p. 514.) Let us utter nothing blasphemous, nothing hasty, nothing bold,
nothing presumptuous, nothing desperate. This is “with reverence and godly fear.” ( c. xii.
28.) For a soul in tribulations becomes desponding, and reckless.3465 But let not us [be so].
See here he again says the same thing which he said before, “not forsaking the assembling
of ourselves together,” for so shall we be able to do all things with reverence. For oftentimes
even out of respect for men, we refrain from doing many evil things.</p>

hospitality”:3467 that is, do not merely entertain strangers, but <del>do it</del> with love for the
strangers. Moreover he did not speak of the recompense that is future, and in store for us,
lest he should make them more supine, but of that already given. For “thereby some” (he
says) “have entertained angels unawares.”</p>
<p>But let us see in what sense “Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.” Because
(he means) it preserves the believer in chastity. Here he also alludes to the Jews, because
they accounted the woman after childbirth3468 polluted: and “whosoever comes from the
bed,” it is said, “is not clean.”3469 Those things are not polluted3470 which arise from nature,

O ungrateful and senseless Jew,3471 but those which arise from choice.3472 For if “marriage
is honorable” and pure, why forsooth dost thou think that one is even polluted by it?</p>
<p>“Let your conversation” (he says) “be without covetousness”: since many after having
exhausted3473 their property, afterwards wish to recover it again under the guise of alms,
therefore he says, “Let your conversation be without covetousness”; that is, that we should
be <del>desirous only</del> of what is necessary3474 and indispensable. What then (you say) if we
should not have a supply even of these? This is not possible; indeed it is not. “For He hath
said,” and He doth not lie, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we boldly say,
The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.” Thou hast the
promise from Himself: do not doubt henceforward. He has promised; make no question.
But this, “I will never leave thee,” he says not concerning money only, but concerning all
other things also. “The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me”;
with good reason.</p>
<p>This then also let us say in all temptations; let us laugh at human things, so long as we
have God favorable to us. For as, when He is our enemy, it is no gain, though all men should
be our friends, so when He is our friend, though all men together war against us, there is
no harm. “I will not fear what man shall do unto me.”</p>
<p><del>6.</del> “Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the
word of God.” In this place I think that he is speaking about assistance also.3475 For this is
<del>implied in the words</del> “who have spoken unto you the word of God.”</p>
<p>“Whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation.” What is, “considering”?
3476 Continually revolving, examining it by yourselves, reasoning, investigating accurately,
testing it as you choose. “The end of their conversation,” that is, their conversation to
the end: for “their conversation” had a good end.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever.” Do not think that then indeed
He wrought wonders, but now works no wonders. He is the same. This is, “remember them
that have the rule over you.”3477</p>

<p>“Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.” “Strange,” that is, different
from those ye heard from us; <del>“Divers”</del> that is, of all sorts: for they have no stability, but
are different <del>one from another</del>. For especially manifold3478 is the doctrine of meats.</p>
<p>“For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats.” These
are the “divers,” these the “strange”3479 <del>doctrines</del>: especially as Christ has said, “not that
which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which cometh out.” ( Matt. xv.
11.) And observe that he does not make bold to say this openly, but as it were by a hint.3480
“For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats.”</p>
<p>Faith is all. If that establishes <del>it</del>, the heart stands in security. It follows that Faith establishes:
consequently reasonings shake. For Faith is contrary to reasoning.</p>
<p>“Which” (he says) “have not profited them that have been occupied therein.” For what
is the gain from the observance3481 <del>of them</del>, tell me. Does it not rather destroy? Does it
not make such an one to be under sin? If it be necessary to observe <del>them</del>, we must guard
ourselves.3482</p>
<p>“Which” (he says) “have not profited them that have been occupied therein.” That is,
who have always diligently kept them.</p>
<p>There is one observance, abstaining from sin. For what profit is it, when some are so
polluted, as not to be able to partake of the sacrifices? So that it did not save them at all; although
they were zealous about the observances. But because they had not faith, even thus
they profited nothing.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> In the next place he takes away3483 the sacrifice from the type, and directs his discourse
to the prototype, saying, “The bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the High Priest, are burned without the camp.” Then those things were a type
of these and thus Christ, suffering “without,” fulfilled all.</p>
<p>Here he makes it plain too that He suffered voluntarily, showing3484 that those things
were not accidental, but even the <del>Divine</del> arrangement itself was of a suffering “without.”
<del>He suffered</del> without, but His Blood was borne up into Heaven. Thou seest then that we
partake of Blood which has been carried into the Holy Place, the True Holy Place; of the
Sacrifice of which the Priest alone had the privilege. We therefore partake of the Truth [the
Reality]. If then we partake not of “reproach” <del>only</del> but of sanctification, 3485 the “reproach”

is the cause of the sanctification. For as He was reproached, so also are we. If we go forth
“without” therefore, we have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>But what is, “Let us go forth to Him”? Let us have fellowship with Him in His sufferings;
let us bear His reproach. For He did not simply bid us dwell “outside the gate,” but as He
was reproached as a condemned person, so also we.</p>
<p>And “by Him let us offer a sacrifice to God.” Of what kind of sacrifice does he speak?
“The fruit of lips giving thanks to His Name.” They [the Jews] brought sheep, and calves,
and gave them to the Priest: let “us” bring none of these things, but thanksgiving. This “fruit”
let “our lips” put forth.</p>
<p>“For with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” Let us give such a sacrifice to Him, that
He may offer <del>it</del> to The Father. For in no other way it is offered except through the Son, or
rather also through a contrite mind. All these things <del>are said</del> for the weak. For that the
thanks belong to the Son is evident: since otherwise, how is the honor equal? “That all men”
(He says) “should honor the Son even as they honor the Father.” ( John v. 23.) Wherein is
the honor equal? “The fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name.”3486</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Let us bear all things thankfully, be it poverty, be it disease, be it anything else
whatever: for He alone knows the things expedient for us. “For we know not what we should
pray for as we ought.” ( Rom. viii. 26.) We then who do not know even how to ask for what
is fitting, unless we have received of3487 the Spirit, let us take care to offer up thanksgiving
for all things, and let us bear all things nobly. Are we in poverty? Let us give thanks. Are we
in sickness? Let us give thanks. Are we falsely accused? Let us give thanks: when we suffer
affliction, let us give thanks.</p>
<p>This brings us near to God: then we even have God for our debtor. But when we are in
prosperity, it is we who are debtors and liable to be called to account. For when we are in
prosperity, we are debtors to God: and oftentimes these things bring a judgment upon us,
while those are for a payment of sins.3488 Those <del>afflictions</del> draw down mercy, they draw
down kindness: while these on the other hand lift up even to an insane pride, and lead also
to slothfulness, and dispose a man to fancy great things concerning himself; they puff up.
Therefore the prophet also said, “It is good for me, Lord, that Thou hast afflicted3489 me;
that I may learn Thy statutes.” ( Ps. cxix. 71.) When Hezekiah had received blessings and
been freed from calamities, his heart was lifted up on high; when he fell sick, then was he
humbled, then he became near to God. “When He slew them,” it says, “then they sought
Him diligently, and turned, and were early in coming to3490 God.” ( Ps. lxxviii. 34.) And

again, “When the beloved waxed gross and fat, then he kicked.” ( Deut. xxxii. 15.) For “the
Lord is known when He executeth judgments.” ( Ps. ix. 16.)</p>
<p><del>9.</del> Affliction is a great good. “Narrow is the way” ( Matt. vii. 14 ), so that affliction3491
thrusts us into the narrow <del>way</del>. He who is not pressed by affliction cannot enter. For he
who afflicts himself in the narrow <del>way</del>, is he who also enjoys ease; but he that spreads
himself out,3492 does not enter in, and suffers from being so to say wedged in.3493 See how
Paul enters into this narrow way. He “keeps under” his “body” ( 1 Cor. ix. 27 ), so as to be
able to enter. Therefore, in all his afflictions, he continued giving thanks unto God. Hast
thou lost thy property? This hath lightened thee of the most of thy wideness. Hast thou
fallen from glory? This is another sort of wideness. Hast thou been falsely accused? Have
the things said against thee, of which thou art nowise conscious to thyself been believed?
“Rejoice and leap for joy.” For “blessed are ye” (He says) “when men reproach you, and say
all manner of evil against you, falsely, for My sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great
is your reward in Heaven.” ( Matt. v. 11, 12.)</p>
<p>Why dost thou marvel, if thou art grieved, and wish to be set free from temptations?
Paul wished to be set free, and oftentimes entreated God, and did not obtain. For the “thrice
for this I besought the Lord,” is oftentimes; “and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for
thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” ( 2 Cor. xii. 8, 9.) By “weakness,” he here
means “afflictions.” What then? When he heard this he received it thankfully, and says,
“Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmities” ( 2 Cor. xii. 10 ); that is, I am pleased, I rest in my
afflictions. For all things then let us give thanks, both for comfort, and for affliction.3494 Let
us not murmur: let us not be unthankful. “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, naked
also shall I depart.” ( Job i. 21.) Thou didst not come forth glorious, do not seek glory. Thou
wast brought into life naked, not of money alone, but also of glory, and of honorable name.</p>
<p>Consider how great evils have oftentimes arisen from wealth. For “It is easier” (it is said)
“for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of Heaven.” ( Matt. xix. 24.) Seest thou to how many good things wealth is a hindrance, and
dost thou seek to be rich? Dost thou not rejoice that the hindrance has been overthrown?
So narrow is the way which leadeth into the Kingdom. So broad is wealth, and full of bulk
and swelling out. Therefore He says, “Sell that thou hast” ( Matt. xix. 21 ), that that way may

receive thee. Why dost thou yearn after wealth? For this cause He took it away from thee,
that He might free thee from slavery. For true fathers also, when a son is corrupted by some
mistress, and having given him much exhortation they do not persuade him to part from
her, send the mistress into banishment. Such also is abundance of wealth. Because the Lord
cares for us, and delivers us from the harm [which arises] therefrom, He takes away wealth
from us.</p>
<p>Let us not then think poverty an evil: sin is the only evil. For neither is wealth a good
thing by itself: to be well-pleasing to God is the only good. Poverty then let us seek, this let
us pursue: so shall we lay hold on heaven, so shall we attain to the other good things. Which
may we all attain by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to
the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, power, honor, now and ever and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXIV.</head>
<p>Hebrews xiii. 17</p>
<p>“Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves. For they watch for your souls,
as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief,3495 for
this is unprofitable for you.”</p>
<p><del>1.</del> Anarchy3496 is an evil, and the occasion of many calamities, and the source of disorder
and confusion. For as, if thou take away the leader from a chorus, the chorus will not
be in tune and in order; and if from a phalanx of an army thou remove the commander, the
evolutions will no longer be made in time and order, and if from a ship thou take away the
helmsman, thou wilt sink the vessel; so too if from a flock thou remove the shepherd, thou
hast overthrown and destroyed all.</p>
<p>Anarchy then is an evil, and a cause of ruin. But no less an evil also is the disobedience
to rulers. For it comes again to the same. For a people not obeying a ruler, is like one which
has none; and perhaps even worse. For in the former case they have at least an excuse for
disorder, but no longer in the latter, but are punished.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one will say, there is also a third evil, when the ruler is bad. I myself
too know it, and no small evil it is, but even a far worse evil than anarchy. For it is better to
be led by no one, than to be led by one who is evil. For the former indeed are oftentimes
saved, and oftentimes are in peril,3497 but the latter will be altogether in peril, being led
into the pit <del>of destruction</del>.</p>
<p>How then does Paul say, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves”?
Having said above, “whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation” ( c. ver.
7 ), he then said, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves.”</p>
<p>What then (you say), when he is wicked should we obey?</p>
<p>Wicked? In what sense? If indeed in regard to Faith, flee and avoid him; not only if he
be a man, but even if he be an angel come down from Heaven; but if in regard to life, be not
over-curious. And this instance I do not allege from my own mind, but from the Divine
Scripture. For hear Christ saying, “The Scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat.” ( Matt.
xxiii. 2.) Having previously spoken many fearful things concerning them, He then says,
“They sit on Moses’ seat: all therefore whatsoever they tell you observe, do; but do not ye
after their works.” ( Matt. xxiii. 2, 3.) They have (He means) the dignity of office, but are of
<note type="footnote">3495 “lamenting,” στενάζοντες</note>
<note type="footnote">3496 It will be observed that St. Chrysostom uses “rulers” (ἄ ρχοντες) and the cognate words, of spiritual
rulers.</note>

<pb n="974"/>
unclean life. Do thou however attend, not to their life, but to their words. For as regards
their characters, no one would be harmed <del>thereby</del>. How is this? Both because their characters
are manifest to all, and also because though he were ten thousand times as wicked,
he will never teach what is wicked. But as respects Faith, <del>the evil</del> is not manifest to all, and
the wicked <del>ruler</del> will not shrink from teaching it.</p>
<p>Moreover, “Judge not that ye be not judged” ( Matt. vii. 1 ) concerns life, not faith: surely
what follows makes this plain. For “why” (He says) “beholdest thou the mote that is in thy
brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?” ( Matt. vii. 3.)</p>
<p>“All things therefore” (He says) “which they bid you observe, do ye” (now to “do” belongs
to works not to Faith) “but do not ye after their works.” Seest thou that <del>the discourse</del> is
not concerning doctrines, but concerning life and works?</p>
<p><del>2.</del> Paul however previously commended them,3498 and then says, “Obey them that
have the rule over you, and submit yourselves, for they watch for your souls, as they that
shall give account.”</p>
<p>Let those who rule also hear, and not only those who are under their rule; that as the
subjects ought to be obedient, so also the rulers ought to be watchful and sober. What sayest
thou? He watches; he imperils his own head; he is subject to the punishments of thy sins,
and for thy sake is amenable to what is so fearful, and art thou slothful, and affectedly indifferent,
and at ease? Therefore he says, “That they may do this with joy, and not with grief:
3499 for this is unprofitable for you.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that the despised ruler ought not to avenge himself, but his great revenge is
to weep and lament? For neither is it possible for the physician, despised by his patient, to
avenge himself, but to weep and lament. But if <del>the ruler</del> lament (he means), God inflicts
vengeance on thee. For if when we lament for our own sins we draw God to us, shall we not
much rather <del>do this</del>, when we lament for the arrogance and scornfulness of others? Seest
thou that he does not suffer him to be led on to reproaches? Seest thou how great is his
philosophy? He ought to lament who is despised, is trodden under foot, is spit upon.</p>
<p>Be not confident because he does not avenge himself on thee, for lamenting is worse
than any revenge. For when of himself he profits nothing by lamenting, he calls on the Lord:
and as in the case of a teacher and nurse, when the child does not listen to him, one is called
in who will treat him more severely, so also in this case.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> Oh! how great the danger! What should one say to those wretched men, who throw
themselves upon so great an abyss of punishments? Thou hast to give account of all over
<note type="footnote">3498 i.e. the rulers, see ver. 7</note>
<note type="footnote">3499 στενάζοντες. It will be observed that St. Chrys. dwells much on this word: and also that he understands

whom thou rulest, women and children and men; into so great a fire dost thou put thy head.
I marvel if any of the rulers can be saved, when in the face of3500 such a threat, and of the
present indifference, I see some still even running on, and casting themselves upon so great
a burden of authority.</p>
<p>For if they who are dragged by force3501 have no refuge or defense, if they discharge
duty ill and are negligent; since even Aaron was dragged by force, and yet was imperiled;3502
and Moses again was imperiled, although he had oftentimes declined; and Saul having been
entrusted with another kind of rule, after he had declined it, was in peril, because he managed
it amiss; how much more they who take so great pains to obtain it, and cast themselves upon
it? Such an one much more deprives himself of all excuse. For men ought to fear and to
tremble, both because of conscience, and because of the burden of the office; and neither
when dragged to it should they once for all decline, nor, when not dragged cast themselves
upon it, but should even flee, foreseeing the greatness of the dignity; and when they have
been seized, they ought again to show their godly fear.3503 Let there be nothing out of
measure. If thou hast perceived it beforehand, retire; convince thyself that thou art unworthy
of the office. Again, if thou hast been seized, in like manner be thou reverential,3504 always
showing rightmindedness.3505</p>
<p><del>4.</del> Ver. 18. “Pray for us” (he says); “for we trust we have a good conscience among
all,3506 willing to live honestly.”</p>
<p>Thou seest that he used these apologies, as writing to persons grieved with him, as to
those who turned away, who were disposed as towards a transgressor, not enduring even
to hear his name? Inasmuch then as he asked from those who hated him what all others ask
from those who love them <del>their prayers for him</del>, therefore he here introduces this; saying,
“We trust that we have a good conscience.” For do not tell me of accusations; our conscience,
he says, in nothing hurts3507 us; nor are we conscious to ourselves that we have plotted

against you. “For we trust,” he says, “that we have a good conscience among all,” not among
the Gentiles only, but also among you. We have done nothing with deceitfulness,3508
nothing with hypocrisy: for it was probable that these <del>calumnies</del> were reported respecting
him. “For they have been informed concerning thee” (it is said) “that thou teachest apostasy.”
( Acts xxi. 21.) Not as an enemy, he means, nor as an adversary I write these things, but as
a friend. And this he shows also by what follows.</p>
<p>Ver. 19. “But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the
sooner.” His thus praying was <del>the act</del> of one who loved them greatly, and that not simply,
but with all earnestness, that so, he says, I may come to you speedily. The earnest desire to
come to them is <del>the mark</del> of one conscious to himself of nothing <del>wrong</del>, also the entreating
them to pray for him.</p>
<p>Therefore having first asked their prayers, he then himself also prays for all good things
on them. ( Ver. 20 ) “Now the God of peace,” he says (be ye not therefore at variance one
with another), “that brought again from the earth the Shepherd of the sheep” (this is said
concerning the resurrection) “the Great <del>Shepherd</del>” (another addition: here again he confirms
to them even to the end, his discourse concerning the Resurrection) “through the
blood of the everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ,” ( ver. 21 ) “make you perfect in
every good work, to do His will, working in you3509 that which is well-pleasing in His sight.”</p>
<p>Again he bears high testimony to them. For that is made “perfect” which having a beginning
is afterwards completed. And he prays for them which is the act of one who yearns
for them. And while in the other Epistles, he prays in the prefaces, here he does it at the end.
“Working in you,” he says, “that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>

I have written a letter unto you in few words.” Seest thou that what he wrote to no one <del>else</del>,
he writes to them? For (he means) I do not even trouble you with long discourse.</p>
<p>I suppose that they were not at all unfavorably disposed towards Timothy: wherefore
he also put him forward.3510 For ( ver. 23 ) “know ye,” he says, “that our brother Timothy
is set at liberty,3511 with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.” “Set at liberty,” he says;
from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not this, that he was sent away
from Athens. For this also is mentioned in the Acts.3512</p>

<p>Ver. 24, 25. “Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy
salute you. Grace be with you all. Amen.”</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Seest3513 thou how he shows that virtue is born3514 neither wholly from God, nor
yet from ourselves alone? First3515 by saying, “make you perfect in every good work”; Ye
have virtue indeed, he means, but need to be made complete. What is “good work and
word”?3516 So as to have both life and doctrines right. “According to His will, working in
you that which is well-pleasing in His sight.”</p>
<p>“In His sight,” he says. For this is the highest virtue, to do that which is well-pleasing
in the sight of God, as the Prophet also says, “And according to the cleanness of my hands
in His eye-sight.” ( Ps. xviii. 24.)</p>
<p>And having written thus much, he said this was little, in comparison with what he was
going to say. As he says also in another place, “As I wrote to you in few words: whereby
when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.” ( Eph. iii. 3, 4.)
And observe his wisdom. He says not, “I beseech you, suffer the word of” admonition,
but “the word of exhortation,”3517 that is, of consolation, of encouragement. No one, he
means, can be wearied at the length of what has been said (Did this then make them turn
away from him? By no means: he does not indeed wish to express this): that is, even if ye
be of little spirit, for it is the peculiarity of such persons not to endure a long discourse.</p>
<p>“Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom if he come shortly I will
see you.” This is enough to persuade them to submit themselves, if he is ready to come with
his disciple.</p>
<p>“Salute them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.” See how he honored them,
since he wrote to them instead of to those <del>their rulers</del>.</p>
<p>“They of Italy salute you. Grace be with you all. Amen.” Which was for them all in
common.</p>
<p>But how does “Grace” come to be “with” us? If we do not do despite to the benefit, if
we do not become indolent in regard to the Gift. And what is “the grace”? Remission of sins,
Cleansing: this is “with” us. For who (he means) can keep the Grace despitefully, and not
destroy it? For instance; He freely forgave thee thy sins. How then shall the “Grace be with”
thee, whether it be the good favor or the effectual working of the Spirit ? If thou draw it to
thee by good deeds. For the cause of all good things is this, the continual abiding with us of
<note type="footnote">3513 St. Chrys. here recurs to ver. 21</note>
<note type="footnote">3514 γεγενημένην … ἐ κ</note>
<note type="footnote">3515 Here as elsewhere St. Chrys. does not expressly mention any “secondly,” but after treating the remaining
verses recurs to the subject in speaking on the words “Grace be with you” : and there indicates a second evidence.</note>
<note type="footnote">3516 See 2 Thess. ii. 17. “Stablish you in every good word and work.” Probably St. Chrys. had this in his mind.</note>

the “grace” of the Spirit. For this guides us to all <del>good things</del>, just as when it flies away
from us, it ruins us, and leaves us desolate.</p>
<p><del>7.</del> Let us not then drive it from us. For on ourselves depends, both its remaining, and
its departing. For the one results, when we mind heavenly things; the other, when <del>we mind</del>
the things of this life. “Which the world” (He says) “cannot receive because it seeth Him
not, neither knoweth Him.” ( John xiv. 17.) Seest thou that a worldly soul cannot have Him?
We need great earnestness that so there He may be held fast by us, so as to direct all our affairs,
and do them in security, and in much peace.</p>
<p>For as a ship sailing with favorable winds is neither to be hindered nor sunk, so long as
it enjoys a prosperous and steady breeze, but also causes great admiration according to the
march of its progress both to the mariners, and to the passengers, giving rest to the one, and
not forcing them to toil on at their oars, and setting the others free from all fear, and giving
them the most delightful view of her course; so too a soul strengthened by the Divine Spirit,
is far above all the billows of this life, and more strongly than the ship, cuts the way bearing
on to Heaven, since it is not sent along by wind, but has all the pure sails filled by the Paraclete
Himself: and He casts out of our minds all that is slackened and relaxed.</p>
<p>For as the wind if it fall upon a slackened sail, would have no effect; so neither does the
Spirit endure to continue in a slack soul; but there is need of much tension, of much vehemence,
so that our mind may be on fire, and our conduct under all circumstances on the
stretch, and braced up. For instance when we pray, we ought to do it with much intentness,
3518 stretching forth the soul toward Heaven, not with cords, but with great earnestness.
Again when we do works of mercy, we have need of intentness, lest by any means, thought
for our household, and care for children, and anxiety about wife, and fear of poverty entering
in, should slacken our sail. For if we put it on the stretch on all sides by the hope of the
things to come, it receives well the energy3519 of the Spirit ; and none of those perishable
and wretched things will fall upon it, yea, and if any of them should fall, it does it no harm,
but is quickly thrown back by the tightness, and is shaken off and fails down.</p>
<p>Therefore we have need of much intentness. For we too are sailing over a great and wide
sea, full of many monsters, and of many rocks, and bringing forth for us many storms, and
from the midst of serene weather raising up a most violent tempest. It is necessary then if
we would sail with ease, and without danger, to stretch the sails, that is, our determination:
for this is sufficient for us. For Abraham also, when he had stretched forth his affections
towards God and set before Him his fixed resolution,3520 what else had he need of? Nothing:
but “he believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.” ( Gen. xv. 6.) But

Faith <del>comes</del> of a sincere will.3521 He offered up his son, and though he did not slay him,
he received a recompense as if he had slain him, and though the work was not done the reward
was given.</p>
<p>Let our sails then be in good order,3522 not grown old (for everything “that is decayed
and waxen old is nigh to vanishing away”3523) ( c. viii. 13 ), not worn into holes, that so they
may bear the energy of the Spirit. “For the natural man,”3524 it is said, “receiveth not the
things of the Spirit.” ( 1 Cor. ii. 14.) For as the webs of spiders could not receive a blast of
wind, so neither will the soul devoted to this life, nor the natural man ever be able to receive
the grace of the Spirit: for our reasonings differ nothing from them,3525 preserving a connection
in appearance only but destitute of all power.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> Our condition, however, is not such, if we are watchful: but whatever may fall upon
<del>the Christian</del>, he bears all, and is above all, stronger than any whirlpool.3526 For suppose
there be a spiritual man, and that innumerable calamities befall him, yet is he overcome by
none of them. And what do I say? Let poverty come upon him, disease, insults, revilings,
mockings, stripes, every sort of infliction, every sort of mocking, and slanders, and insults:
yet, as though he were outside the world, and set free from the feelings of the body, so will
he laugh all to scorn.</p>
<p>And that my words are not mere boasting, I think many <del>such</del> exist even now; for instance,
of those who have embraced the life of the desert. This however, you say, is nothing
wonderful. But I say that of those also who live in cities, there are such men unsuspected.
If thou wish however, I shall be able to exhibit some among those of old. And that thou
mayest learn, consider Paul, I pray thee. What is there fearful that he did not suffer, and
that he did not submit to? But he bore all nobly. Let us imitate him, for so shall we be able
to land in the tranquil havens with much merchandise.</p>
<p>Let us then stretch our mind towards Heaven, let us be held fast by that desire, let us
clothe ourselves with spiritual fire, let us gird ourselves with its flame. No man who bears
flame fears those who meet him; be it wild beast, be it man, be it snares innumerable, so
long as he is armed with fire, all things stand out of his way, all things retire. The flame is
intolerable, the fire cannot be endured, it consumes all.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving, we must bear all with, to attain the true joy, 442, 517; as St. Paul did, 517; to
God, both for comfort and afflictions, 518; brings untold blessings, 459, 460; without,
we cannot serve God, 514; our offering, 517; offered with a contrite mind, ib.; due to
God the Son, ib.</p>
<p>Thoughts, some beyond power of expression, 370, 372.</p>
<p>Through or by (διὰ), not limited to the Son, but used of the Father, too, 384; cf. on Galatians,
pp. 4, 5.</p>
<p>To-day, 373, 394 sqq., 399, 515.</p>
<p>Tombs, why they of old cared for their, 482; of Sts. Peter, Paul, John, Thomas, known, of
rest unknown, ib.; where any one's may be, the earth is the Lord's, ib.</p>
<p>Tongue, why given us, 368.</p>
<p>Trial, without, we cannot know ourselves, 380; life full of those who cause, and thus
strengthen us, 456; God exercises His athletes with, 478; in, bearing with evil a great
weapon, 504.</p>
<p>Trinity, see God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Truth our girdle, 450.</p>
<p>Unbelief, 469, 471; arises sometimes from faint heart, 416.</p>
<p>Vainglory, source of evils, 490; we act for, 496.</p>
<p>Virgin souls, pure even though married, 496, 498; literal virginity a mere shadow of, 498;
the true, ib.</p>
<p>Virtue, like bitter medicine, 503.</p>
<p>Virtues, to practice one by one, careful in learning one not to lose another, 476, 477.</p>
<p>Wants, who has few, preferred, 374, 495 sqq.</p>
<p>Water, taken, lessens not fountain; so works remain to doer, 368; fevered person drinking
much, not high-minded, 373; quenches hot iron, so forbearance anger, 468.</p>
<p>Wealth, peril of love of, 476; peril of, 518. See Money, Poor, Poverty, Covetous.</p>
<p>Wicked, sometimes has here the reward of a few good deeds, there utter punishment, 391;
instances of, ib.; God wills that His children show compassion for the, 417; deride and
condemn their like, 474; thereby judge themselves, ib.</p>
<p>Wickedness, by remembering God we forget, 437; of alms from ill-gotten gains, 481.</p>
<p>Wife, a great good and great evil, 459.</p>

<pb n="1037"/>
<p>Will, with, nothing difficult, 432; not even to overcome sin, 493; inclines readily to ill, 425;
great power of, not apart from action, 445, 446; two kinds of, 451, 452; alone needed,
477; of it comes faith, 522.</p>
<p>Wine, need of moderation in, 402.</p>
<p>Women, breed of, in towns weak through delicate habits, 501; in the country stronger than
men in towns, ib.</p>
<p>Words, human, fail to express God, Him must we praise, 370; thoughts not to be expressed
by, 370, 372; our, bare, God's not so, 372.</p>
<p>Works, good or ill, the doer first reaps the fruit of, 368; who holds the Faith and does right,
of full age, 409; dead, a grievous offense, 441; our work and God's act combine, 455;
God's grace preceding, our work following, 476; good, need of, 457; aid from, 447; the
wealth of, 450; of teachers, their power, 455; ill, 457.</p>
<p>World, to be one day transfigured, 376; avails not weighed against the saints, 475, 489; nor
against the soul's beauty, 498.</p>
<p>Yawning, at prayers, 490.</p>
<p>Yonder, Heaven, 391, 397, 398, 408, 444, 474, 480, 490; are the Rewards, the punishments,
391; the Rewards, ib.; the Rest, 477.</p>
<p>Young man, has excuse only in things that need experience, not courage and effort, 402;
ascetic habits his safeguard against strong temptation, 403.</p>

<p>’s Bible Dictionary (where the proportion is stated as 16 out of 32); but my attention was
first called to the bearing of this upon the question of authorship by the quick observation
of Rev. Hermann Lilienthal. It is not easy to give a precise numerical statement of the
proportion because of the large number of historical allusions which can hardly be
reckoned as quotations, and also because the New Testament writers often clothe their
thoughts in the familiar words of the Old Testament, apparently without any conscious
quotation. This matter, however, which cannot be tabulated, is quite in accord with the
rest, and the whole Epistle is saturated with the language and the historical allusions of
the Psalms. Taking only what may fairly be considered as designed quotations, the relative
numbers taken from the Psalms are: Hebrews, 200; St. Luke, 25; St. Paul, 39; all others, 25.
The Apocalypse is omitted from the calculation. In the comparatively few quotations in
St. Luke less than one-third (17 out of 55) are from the Psalms, and every one of these in
recording the words of others; less than one-fifth in St. Paul (16 out of 89); and in the
others 22 out of 116. In Hebrews almost exactly one-half.: 678</p>

there is no appearance that the Apostle called Christ’s body heaven, nor do any of the
texts cited show it. If however, we introduce καὶ before τὸ σῶμα, or substitute it for τὸ,
we have a good sense, in accordance with the four texts cited by St Chrys. and the explanations
which he afterwards gives. <del status="error">The</del> criticism of the English editor is not without some

of the Greeks to express a proposition put forward to be argued from, to see what consequences
follow from it, with a view of showing it to be untrue, or determining the sense
in which it is true. St. Chrys. means to say that this proposition was only thus argumentatively

<p>U+0026c <gap reason=" omitted"/>The corrector seems to have misapprehended the meaning of ἐ ξ οὗ in this place.: 699</p>
<p>U+0026c. Mr. Field thinks that either the thread of the discourse is broken, and the second point
not mentioned, or (which seems more probable) that it is contained in the words: 796</p>
<p>U+0026c. N.T. and some mss.: 646</p>
<p>U+0026c. The translation follows the Bened. pointing, as giving the meaning most in accordance
with St. Chrys.’s teaching. <del>This pointing of the English edition is allowed to stand as
making the sense more obvious to the English reader; but Mr. Field’s pointing gives essentially
the same sense and is more in St. Chrysostom’s style.—F.G.</del>: 831</p>
<p>U+0026c. There does not however appear to be any need for this: on the contrary, while the old
text is simple and intelligible, the additions bring in matters which are out of place. <del>The
other Catena, however, that of Niketas, Archbishop of Heraklea, one of Mr. Field’s valuable
authorities, has the bracketed bits.</del>: 815</p>
<p>U+0026c. What is meant is that Christian belief which finds expression in the Creed, as well as
<del status="error">elsewhere.—F.G.</del>: 765</p>
<p>U+0026c. <del>But previously he has connected with γέφος, so that the present. connection with ὄ
γκον was probably an afterthought on the spur of the moment.—F.G.</del>: 924</p>
<p>U+0026c. he indicated the equality of His Substance and His nearness to the Father.: 696</p>
<p>U+0026c., as is read in the received version of the Epistle, where Lachman adopts the reading
τίνα: 758</p>
<p>pU+0026c., the LXX. have, μὴ δῴης εἰς σάλον τὸν πόδα σον, μηδὲ νυστάξῃ (Vat.) ὁ φυλάσσων σε:
794</p>
<p>U+0026c.: for this the common editions have προετυποῦτο: 821</p>
<p>U+0026c.: the shorter text has only οὐδὲ: 769</p>
<p>(pro def. trium capp. lib. xi. c. 5, p. 488, ed Sirm.) <del>Gall.</del> Bibl. Patr: 804</p>
<p>But τὸ σῶμα should be the subject and σκηνὴν καὶ καταπέτασμα καὶ οὐρανόν predicates.—

<p>Mr. Field says that the old translation of Mutianus in some degree confirms this latter
reading, which is easier. The word ὑ πόστασιν in the singular is used in the sense of: 696</p>
<p>So perhaps it might be an error of Chrysostom.: 875</p>
<p>They are found in the common editions of the Epistle, but are not supposed to be a genuine
part of the Sacred Text. <del>They are rejected by all critical editors, and have very little support
from the authorities for this text.—F.G.</del>: 882</p>

<p><del>This is also given in the margin of W. H. and of the Revisers.</del> Lachmann <del>and Tisch., W.

<head>NPNF1-13. Saint Chrysostom: Homilies on Galatians, Ephesians,
Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, and
Philemon by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some of the greatest
theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians
for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even today!
